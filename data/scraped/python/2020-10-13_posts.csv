j9yz3x,Can we do Social Media Manger jobs in Python,"I was reading this article on medium - [link](https://medium.com/swlh/automating-social-media-marketing-with-python-chapter-1-dde69fca948e)

And I was wondering what if I can automate jobs of social media manager in python.

Eg. Twitter Sentiment (for finding out what people think)

Auto posting for campaigns,

Also can provide data Viz to showcase client how are their social media accounts doing. What they can do? (Analytics stuff) 

Does this sound good only in my head or is this achievable? 
What are the major challenges I may face ? Is this even possible to achieve ?",6,python,2020-10-13

j9thva,Instagram Engagement telegram bot - OpenSource (Free)," 

We have been getting a lot of requests for an **Instagram engagement telegram bot**, so I built something **extraordinary** and published the project source code for free on **Github**. The aim was to develop something that works better than all other paid options available.

See [https://github.com/konichar/Engagement-Pushbot](https://github.com/konichar/Engagement-Pushbot) and please **Star this project** if you find it interesting it really helps encourage users as well as contributors.

ja07mw,Python and Golang (Go),"I recently read an article on Medium that makes a compelling case regarding the future of Python. As somebody learning Python right now, I'd like to know from some of the veteran developers if Golang (GO) is gaining popularity as much as this article is suggesting? The article even suggests Python is eventually going to be replaced by Go. What are your thoughts? Article below:

j9tjsi,A Python study app,"I have been developing a Python study app for a few months now and it is finally in open beta on Google Play.  My goal is to make Python accessible to beginners and to guide them through the basics using short lessons and activities that will test their knowledge. 

Currently, there are 33 short lessons and hundreds of activities.  The activities are randomly selected with an emphasis on the most recent lesson.  

I would love to get some feedback from both Python beginners and vets.  What is your overall impression of the app?  What would you do differently?  Am I missing any key concepts? 

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

jaf51g,Austin -- CPython frame stack sampler v2.0.0 is now available,"I am delighted to announce the release 2.0.0 of Austin. If you haven't heard of Austin before, it is an open source frame stack sampler for CPython, distributed under the GPLv3 license. It can be used to obtain statistical profiling data out of a running Python application without a single line of instrumentation. This means that you can start profiling a Python application straight away, even while it's running on a production environment, with minimal impact on performance.

The simplest way of using Austin is by piping its output to FlameGraph for a quick and detailed representation of the collected samples.

Austin is a pure C application that has no other dependencies other than the C standard library. Its source code is hosted on GitHub at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin

The README contains installation and usage details, as well as some examples of Austin in action. Details on how to contribute to Austin's development can be found at the bottom of the page.

Austin can be installed easily on the following platforms and from the following sources:

Linux:

* Snap Store
* Debian repositories

macOS:

* Homebrew

Windows:

* Chocolatey
* Scoop

Austin is also simple to compile from sources as it only depends on the standard C library, if you don't have access to the above-listed sources.

Besides support for Python 3.9, this new release of Austin brings a considerable performance enhancement that allows it to sample up to 8 times faster than previous versions. But please do read on until the end to find out about some new tools that take advantage of all the key features of Austin.

Due to increasing popularity, the sample Python applications that were included in the main repository have been moved to dedicated projects on GitHub. The TUI can now be found at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-tui

while Austin Web is now available from

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-web

They can both be installed easily from PyPI, but in order to use them, the Austin binary needs to be on the PATH environment variable. These projects now rely on the austin-python Python package that provides a Python wrapper around Austin. If you are considering making your own profiling tool based on Austin, this package can spare you from writing boilerplate code, so it's worth having a look at it at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-python

The documentation is hosted on RTD at

https://austin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Finally, I am happy to announce the release of pytest-austin, a plugin for pytest that allows you to set up performance regression testing by simply decorating your existing pytest test suite. The plugin launches Austin to profile your test runs, meaning that no further instrumentation is required. For more details, check out the project on GitHub

https://github.com/P403n1x87/pytest-austin

Like the other Austin tools, pytest-austin can be installed easily from PyPI.

You can stay up-to-date with the project's development by following Austin on Twitter (https://twitter.com/AustinSampler).",1,python,2020-10-13
