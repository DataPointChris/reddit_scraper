He was being given the equivalent of multiple \\'standard units\\' of alcohol a day (everyday for years) by the time I discovered him (and beaten if he wouldn\\'t drink them), but as his tolerance was meaning he was no longer \\'fun\\' to watch staggering he was going to be shot shortly. I offered to \\'take him off their hands\\', and digger and I went through a hard road of weaning the dog off alcohol, and treating medical problems. the latter was hard due to no research done into this area in vet medicine, and the fact it is statutorily illegal to give a dog alcohol... even in a veterinary setting, and he was having severe withdrawals. In most vets opinion even if weaning the dog off alcohol in an abuse situation. He basically was a textbook of \"put him to sleep\".\\n\\n**TL;DR of this post:** Here are photos (some are albums, scroll down!) which show how well he is doing!\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/a/GY89UDi](https://imgur.com/a/GY89UDi)\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/a/Bpa1iGM](https://imgur.com/a/Bpa1iGM) (love this album the most!)\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/a/u5FHCIW](https://imgur.com/a/u5FHCIW)\\n\\nSo basically I first want to thank a redditor who (unsolicited) sent me just $75usd and allowed digger to get some toys, bones, and has a ‘raincoat’ on order as in Australia it’s winter now! The photos show his new tug toy, collar, and one of the treats purchased with that money...\\n\\nAnyhow, DIGGER HAS BEEN DOING VERY WELL! I have been not doing so well, as some of you know I have my own demon’s and they are catching up with me in a major way, and thus I haven’t been able to walk digger as much as I wanted. However, my step-dad (whom is no longer with my mum but I stuck with him over her, long story) lives near by and has taken up walking! 3 days a week he gives Digger a **20-25km walk (14-17 mile) walk(!!!)** and on the other days I gives him a 3-4km walk (2-2.5 miles) and he is getting good muscle tone! This has worked out well, as I am getting the amount of exercise I can, and digger has been getting the amount of exercise he *NEEDS* due to his breed. He has the best muscle tone he has probably EVER had!\\n\\nHe has been enjoying the extra treats provided by the kind redditor. I know it is controversial, but I believe in bones as Digger’s only real health issue is some build up on his teeth and thus bones and pigs ears are a good way he can get them a bit cleaned, and we have him booked in at the vets to have his teeth professionally cleaned in 2 weeks.\\n\\nIt’s sad the tribe has been disbanded, due to it\\'s Elders being arrested and charged (not for crimes against Digger, but against children and welfare fraud…) and I now am one of a group of ‘elders’ that have control of the land owned. My idea is to make it into a nature preservation with a camping area open to all as there are many iconic Aussie animals that inhabit the area and erect a monument to the tribe (nothing disparaging) whom once lived there and how they now “wish to share it with the world” as “a gift to humanity”. I am a pariah in the council, and thus don’t know how this will go down, but as the alternative would mean a tribe’s heritage being completely eliminated I think a monument and a ‘gift to future generations’ is the best solution.\\n\\nAs for Digger, he has been living the high life! long walks down by a river where he is able to be on a 12\\' (3.6m) leash, new toys, treats, and all the “new toy excitement” was so GREAT and obviously made him feel even happier that I have made a commitment I will keep up buying him new toys etc., because the only thing better than a tug-toy is a new tug-toy, right? :-p\\n\\n***NB:*** *He buries his bones in a flower pot, he does have a large backyard but seems to think the flowerpot is the safest place to hide them from, I don\\'t know, bone thiefs that sneak in lol!*\\n\\nHe is getting on in age but in good health. He averages 8mph on the walks with me sDad which is quite impressive as the vets think he may be closer to 12y/o now than the original estimate which would have had him at 9y/o.\\n\\nI personally just can’t imagine my life without him. He has been basically my ‘sidekick’ and as my first dog, has shown my his loyalty. I have two cats, which don’t get on, and Digger often ‘attends’ to them if they start growling by going and licking both of them. If me or my wife is upset… he attends to it by licking us. He is so sweet!\\n\\nMy sDad cut a window in our gate so he has a bigger gap watch the street from his bean-bag and get sun in the mornings, which can be seen in a photo... though in the photos because of rain we had pulled it back. He has a raincoat on order so he can be walked in the rain (courtesy of the anonymous donor).\\n\\nI think this about sums up my update, but basically he’s a happy and healthy boy although sadly getting old (see how his nose area is grey lol) but he still acts like a puppy. When walking him I often pass a school at leaving time, and so many people mistake him for a puppy (or at least excitedly shout “OMG Puppy!” and Digger gets up on two feet and walks like a human which is always popular…\\n\\nI think in a way Digger teaches me a lot. The fact he had spent years of his life constantly abused, still with an injury too his throat from being chained up without a collar too tightly, but still he accepted me and my wife as his ‘pack’ fairly easily. Took a while until a spark came back into his eyes, but now he is happiest when either on a way, or sleeping at the foot of the bed with my wife and I, often under the blankets sleeping either on our under our feet!)\\n\\nI also want to thank the [r/dogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/) community for all it’s help in the beginning when I had no idea if Digger would survive or how to help him. It was invaluable for both encouraging me to keep trying and to not give up! I also want to emphasise how a dog can make a tremendous turn around in life. I never took photos of his condition when I first got him, as I felt it disrespectful. I wish I had now given his outcome. He had NO fur on his rump or hind legs and the skin was leathery… he had just been chewing on it. The only time he was let off his chain was too be the ‘entertainment’ by being got drunk for the amusement of the families.\\n\\nThank you all for helping me help Digger to become the wonderful companion he is today!',\n  31,\n  'dogs',\n  '2020-07-05'),\n ('hlye7u',\n  '[Discussion] What specific training techniques did you guys use/are using with your pups?',\n  'I’ve had my Bailey (a Pomsky) for 3 weeks now.

They are only recognized in the United States.\\n\\n* ESAs are only granted rights through the [Air Carrier Access Act](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ae47679a5dc0b0cdd685abc7e3437dbb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt14.4.382&amp;rgn=div5) and [Fair Housing Act](https://www.justice.gov/crt/fair-housing-act-2). As such, the **ONLY** no-pet places ESAs are allowed are airline cabins and most housing.\\n\\n* ESAs are prescribed by a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or doctor as part of an ongoing plan to treat or manage a federally recognized disability. Online registration options for ESAs are scams and not legally recognized.\\n\\n* An ESA must be requested as part of a reasonable accommodation for a disability with a letter from the prescribing medical professional demonstrating the need for the accommodation to be granted housing rights. These housing rights do not exist in the case of the [The “Mrs. Murphy” Exception](https://fairhousing.foxrothschild.com/2010/06/articles/fha-basics/the-mrs-murphy-exemption-to-the-fair-housing-act/). Landlords cannot legally require you to pay a \\'pet deposit\\' or charge \\'pet rent\\' for your ESA because they are not considered pets. However, they can require that you pay for repairs if your ESA causes damage to the property.\\n\\n* ESAs can be any animal it is legal to own, for example: dogs, cats, guinea pigs and miniature horses. They are most commonly dogs.\\n\\n* **Calling your pet an ESA to get around no-pet accommodation, breed bans, or airline restrictions is immoral and illegal. It makes it much harder for legitimate ESA teams to be taken seriously.**\\n\\n**Service Dogs (SDs)**\\n\\nSDs are a worldwide, legally protected medical aid which provide a range of tasks or work to help disabled people. The following discusses information specific to the US. Please check your country’s laws if you live outside of the US.\\n\\n* SDs are not used solely by the blind. SDs can assist those with a wide range of disabilities including physical (eg. fibromyalgia), sensory (eg. deafness), psychiatric (eg. PTSD), developmental (eg. autism) and neurological (eg. brain injury). \\n\\n* SDs can be trained by programs or by their owners (owner-trained).\\n\\n* SDs must perform at least one task to mitigate their owner\\'s disability/ies. Things which do not count as work or tasks include: emotional support, being calmed by the animal\\'s presence, or giving \\'kisses\\' on command. Some examples of tasks can be found [here](http://www.iaadp.org/tasks.html).\\n\\n* SDs can legally enter almost any no-pet place. Exceptions include sterile environments, places where it would be dangerous to the SD or others for them to be there (such as some exhibits in zoos), and food preparation areas.\\n\\n* Any SD can be legally asked to leave an establishment if their behavior is disruptive. For example, if they bark at customers, damage goods, or eliminate on the floor.\\n\\n* There are no nationwide or statewide registries for SDs. None. Some SDs are provided by programs, but the programs themselves are not official registries as SDs come from a variety of places. SDs are also not required to wear a vest or harness.\\n\\n* The only questions legally allowed to be asked of a service dog handler when entering an establishment are: 1) \"Is that animal required because of a disability?\" 2) \"What work or task has the animal been trained to perform?\" If the handler does not answer these questions appropriately, the animal may be restricted from entering or asked to leave.\\n\\n* In order to rent/own a dwelling that has a \\'no-pets\\' clause with an SD, a reasonable accommodation must be requested from the landlord. If your disability and/or your disability-related need for the SD is not evident, information must be provided to the landlord detailing this (for example, a letter from a medical professional). Landlords cannot legally require you to pay a \\'pet deposit\\' or charge \\'pet rent\\' for your SD because they are not considered pets. However, they can require that you pay for repairs if your SD causes damage to the property.\\n\\n* Many states do not protect the rights of service dogs in training.\\n\\n* Service animals also do not have to be dogs. Federally, miniature horses are also granted rights as a service animal. Some state laws grant rights to even more animals.\\n\\n* In 19 states (and counting) it is illegal to present your pet as a service dog when it is just a pet or an ESA. Faking a SD to get around no-pet housing, take your pet to the store, or bring your pet to college makes it much harder for legitimate SD teams to live their lives and poses a serious danger to the public.\\n\\n**Therapy animals**\\n\\nTherapy animals are animals (primarily dogs) trained by their owner to provide therapeutic support to others. They go to places such as schools, nursing homes, and hospitals to relieve stress, build people’s confidence, and promote emotional health. They do not provide support or assistance to their owner.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you require emotional support through the presence of an animal, you should look into ESAs. If you require ways to alleviate your disability, you should look into service dogs. If you wish to volunteer with your dog to help others, you should look into therapy dogs. Further information can be found [here](https://adata.org/publication/service-animals-booklet), [here](https://www.animallaw.info/article/faqs-emotional-support-animals) and [here](http://servicedogcentral.org/content/).\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
