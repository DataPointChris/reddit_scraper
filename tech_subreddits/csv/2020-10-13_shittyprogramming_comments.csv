The regular expression to evaluate this is the following: [+-]?[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?([Ee][+-]?[0-9]+)?

Looks crazy as fuck, right? Well, let‚Äôs walk through it.

[+-]? : either a plus or minus, which is optional.

[0-9]+: any digit between 0-9 repeated 1 or more times (so you can do things like 16382747 but you have to have at least one digit)

(.[0-9]+)? : The question mark makes this whole piece optional, but it‚Äôs the section after the decimal (the mantissa). You have a required decimal, then 1 or more digits.

[Ee] is either an uppercase or lowercase E. This is required.

[+-]? optional sign, same as before.

[0-9]+ 1 or more digits, same as before.

The question mark outside means that entire group, as it‚Äôs formally called, is optional, suggesting that you don‚Äôt have to have a scientific notation piece.

Note the important symbols:

? means 0 or 1 of the previous token or group (aka optional)

+ means one or more of the previous token or group.

* means *zero* or more of the previous token.

[0-9] is a *character class*. This means, as I said above, you can use any digit between 0 and 9. This is equivalent to [0|1|2|...|9] (read as 0 OR 1 OR 2 ... OR 9).",27.0

I think it's impossible to implement exponentiation though. You can use repeated multiplication to exponentiate by a constant, but it's not possible to exponentiate by a variable.

* Create Work Board item with specified sub tasks. Probably an epic too may I add.
* Groom the item, and have all developers spending 2 hours calculating the items' story points.
* Run the feature/epic through project management, which again creates a sub-project to calculate whether or not it's worth the risk or not.
* Create a committee of partially externally hired neutral resources, to evaluate what libraries, frameworks and programming languages would be most suited to solve the problem.
* Hire a couple of additional architectures, to create the initial architectural foundation.
* Spend months discussing whether or not the best course of action, is to outsource the implementation to India, China or Poland - Only to conclude with Iceland.
* Hire a new scrum master, to manage the sub-tasks the tasks describing the creation of the app requires.
* Hire some 2-3 new QA testers, to verify the integrity of the app.
* Create load balancing tests, to verify the app can handle the amount of throughput its requirements demands.
* Hire a security specialist, to perform penetrations tests.
* Hire (another) security specialist, this time through an external company, for a second opinion about the original security specialist's conclusion.
* Realise that app's features could be replaced by the Work Items board in Azure, phase out the app to the legacy department, and go back to start.
* Create a company wide policy about not creating additional TODO comments in the future, to avoid spending company resources evaluating problems with existing solutions.
* Put down a committee of people evaluating the above item's necessity for the company to implement into its corporate wide policies.

2. The limit of A/N for any A as N approaches ‚àû is 0. 

The algorithm sorts based on A &gt; B, so we know because of (1) that the algorithm holds true if we divide all the numbers by a constant N. Furthermore, we know because of (1) that max(values/N) = max(values)/N.

Therefore, as N approaches infinity, sort time approaches 0 (2) while sorting remains accurate. (technically then my above comment was a slightly incorrect; replace `Infinity` with `Number.MAX_VALUE`).

So let's assume we want the algorithm to be correct. This would result in a correct sort, I think:

1. Create N timeouts for an array of N numbers.
2. Request the scheduler to start all timeouts at the same time. (Otherwise the algorithm is quite trivially not correct.)
3. The scheduler must have the following property: All timeouts with an end time of T must be completed before timeouts with an end time of T + 1.
4. The sort might not be stable, but that doesn't matter for the elements we are trying to sort.

The Javascript scheduler certainly isn't this strict, but we could build a system that does this, surely. The issue is that we are effectively shoving off the sort to the scheduler. How would you implement a scheduler that resolves the timeouts in linear fashion while still keeping the property mentioned in point (3) intact?

Right. You can't. So now you've implemented a sorting algorithm that, at best, is O(n log n) with some huge constant factor for the scheduling and threading overhead, and at worst you're using an NP-complete scheduler to solve your polynomial sorting problem.

Congratulations!",1.0
g20brfq,ibiwjb,"While I agree completely with your assessment about correctness, I don‚Äôt see how you reach the conclusion that the algorithm is O(n log n) at best. 

I think the third point you mentioned there is not possible for schedulers to do, not because of time complexity, but rather because of the non-deterministic nature of how long it takes to execute given code on modern non-real-time systems.

In any case, I was just joking about the O(n) complexity. In reality if we assume that all the points you made are assured by the scheduler, then the runtime would be more like O(n + m) where m is the largest number in the list. The time taken by the scheduler itself should be constant per setTimeout call I‚Äôd think so it should not affect this.",1.0
g20u11h,ibiwjb,"I reach the conclusion that the algorithm is O(n log n) at best because it has been proven that the best sorting algorithms cannot be faster than O(n log n). IF it is correct, that is.

&gt; I think the third point you mentioned there is not possible for  schedulers to do, not because of time complexity, but rather because of  the non-deterministic nature of how long it takes to execute given code  on modern non-real-time systems. 

It depends on the system. I could build my own scheduler that implements that property mentioned in (3). The only thing that might hinder me is if the scheduler was absolutely required to hit all deadlines (executing the timeout function with 150ms wait at exactly 150ms after registering the timeout), but I'm assuming that it's legal to miss deadlines. 

I'm not talking about existing systems. I'm thinking about a theoretical scheduler that might exist to investigate the problem of this sorting algorithm's correctness and asymptotic runtime.

&gt; The time taken by the scheduler itself should be constant per setTimeout call I‚Äôd think so it should not affect this. 

This time cannot be constant because the list we are going through is, assuming the worst case, unsorted. The scheduler will have to do some work to put the tasks in some order such that it can observe the waiting times correctly. It HAS to do this, otherwise it cannot schedule the tasks.

Also, you can log any expression without pausing the program with the debugger if you really want to.

Project managers and all that other stuff only comes up after. Essentially hiring people to do parts of the programmer's job that other's can do to leave the programmers more time to work on the hard stuff.

The developer needs to take control of the technical aspects of the project. He should be telling the project manager what it's going to take to build the thing, the project manager should be figuring out how to shift resources, goals, events, meetings, release dates, and jockeying emails to enable the the project to move forward.

Basic Usage: 

* Select View -&gt; Validation Selector -&gt; Easy... then click OK
* Click Run
* Program will begin to try to generate a solution program using a sort of genetic algorithm
* Program tries to create 250 sandbox web workers to run 500 programs per generation
* The app shows a random app from the current generation and also the most fit program if it exists
* If by some miracle it finds a fit program you can try to validate it by going to View -&gt; Solution Validator though there is some strangeness because I have introduced `return` which messes up my unit test validation scheme

fsbijor,gtabkz,"No, I mean it seriously, and it's advice I've heard from others as well. C++ is a huge, complicated language. Arguably the most complicated popular language there is. To write professional code, i.e. code to be maintained by more than just yourself, you should write the simplest code possible, which means eschewing many cpp ""features"", such as constructors and exceptions. You may observe that this breaks RAII. That's ok. RAII was very cool in the 90s but we've gotten better at understanding how to manage dependencies since then. In C, if you need a place to store an object, instead of allocating it yourself you should accept a pointer param to store it at. Likewise for closing files or sockets or any other RAII destructor behavior, you should make the callsite responsible. Similarly in more modern OO languages, you try to avoid newing up your own objects. Instead you dependency-inject them.

Remember Shazam, the thing that identified music? Well, it uses a hash function to turn audio into a set of bits. One of the features of that function, though, (and this is oversimplifying a ton) is that similar sounds produce similar bits. So you get a recording, run it through the function, compare it to all known bit strings, and if it's close to one of them, you return the song mapped to that bit string.

frh27wj,gnuhza,"[Censr: Automatic censor for audio streams. For use in radio shows, streams, etc.](https://devpost.com/software/censr)

To demo, a user sets up a YouTube live stream and watches the stream from another computer. If a bad word is detected from the program on the streamer's computer, the YouTube live stream on the watcher's computer is muted for a short time and unmuted after the audio segment with the bad word passes.

It's really not much of a program (&lt;500 lines), more of a proof-of-concept. But apparently the idea and its utility for streamers, as well as our presentation demo (which miraculously went off without a hitch) were really appealing to the judges, especially because the competition was media-themed. We were completely shocked when we made it to the final round of presentations.

There were a ton of other amazing projects in the finals, so we were sure the top two spots would be impossible to win, and that third place would be a stretch. They announced that another team had won third and we were like ""alright, let's get outta here, we got way farther than we were expecting anyways"". And then they were like ""second place goes to Censr"" and we all looked at each other in complete disbelief before losing our minds. I've been blessed to be a part of a lot of cool stuff over the years (programming, music and otherwise), but this one takes the cake for ""most satisfying and entirely unexpected achievement"". Especially because each of us got a sweet Logitech G513 light-up mechanical gaming keyboard as a prize.

It's hilarious to me that we won because out of the four Hackathons my teammates and I had participated in, this was far and away the one we put the least effort into. We finished the project basically halfway through the competition since it was so simple, and then just spent the rest of the time watching anime and The Room and walking to ice cream shops and music stores in Columbia.

Moral of the story: if you come across a pretty solid idea, and you can materialize it with a simple but showy code base, you can experience all the fun of a Hackathon (free food and sponsor swag, leaving the venue to explore new places, goofing off with your teammates) without all the sleep deprivation and crunch-time stress, and maybe even win something for your minimal efforts.

That said, I'd make sure your unit tests use innocent words in any case (e.g. someone else's suggestion of using ""apple"") and I'd consider making the profanity list user-provided if you're still concerned about it being a deal breaker.

fql2kxq,gjav7b,"Sure, in that case it would get returned. But the finally block is supposed to *execute* regardless of exception. So what happens to the finally return expression if it won't be used, does it still get evaluated? This would be important if it has side effects.",3.0
fql7lbl,gjav7b,"TLDR: The return value is overridden.

So that's one of my favorite quirks of try-finally statements. Usually when programming we all get used to 'return' being a way to instantly stop the execution of a method. We even reinforce this by recommending using conditional returns like

    ... 
    if (a &lt; 0) 
        return 0; 
    ...

instead of nested conditionals like

    ... 
    if (a &lt; 0) 
        return 0; 
    else { 
        ... 
    }

As you already said, if a finally block exists, it will **always** execute if the corresponding try block has been entered. Now if we use another return statement within the finally block the return value, which was saved (since it would be returned after executing the finally block) is overridden. This is the case sind both return instructions write a return value to the same address.  

Here you've got an example of return not behaving the way you're usually expecting it to behave. [Here](https://programming.guide/java/try-finally.html) is a better explanation of control flow when using a finally statement.",12.0

fopr6jd,g8b1th,"If you take a group of programmers there tends to not quite be a bell curve of capability. There tends to be 3 bumps on the bell curve. One bump of programmers who are worse than useless (literally better to have them do nothing). A bunch of programmers who make up the moderately capable, and then the 10x programmers who are 10 times as productive as the middle programmers. 

It is not something like they type 10x more quickly, but that their architectures are more resilient, they program things only once, they program in a straight line toward their target (without having to backtrack for bugs), and they tend to write very little code for the functionality they generate. A true 10x programmer also writes code that makes the people who follow better, in that it is so clear and maintainable. 

Few programmers who are 10x tend to be paid anything like 10x by most companies. What I have seen happen is they work, quit, work quit, and then finally find a company that rewards them where they stay.

The funny part is how the 10x programmers aren't initially missed by their older companies but the companies wonder why productivity suddenly drops to a much lower level. Easily measured through the number of features in each new release, and the number of releases that have serious problems. 

The ultimate 10x programmer I witnessed leave ( who was actually a 3D artist in a 3D company) was leaving when the owners suddenly got all legal on his ass trying threats and whatnot for him to stay. The trigger that drove him out was not just his low pay, but the price one of the owners had purchased a car (not loaned or leased) was more than his salary while the owners claimed there wasn't enough money to give him a raise. So he left for a seriously massive pay increase. 

The company closed 6 months later. I can fully attribute their closure to his departure as I know someone who had been using their services and asked me if I knew why the quality of their output had plummeted. He had single-handedly been carrying 30 animators. 

The funny part is how different people have responded to this story. Some say he should have stayed for the other 30. Some say the owners deserved whatever pay they got and that their car purchase had nothing to do with his pay as they were unrelated. But the majority see that they were living large (including the other 30) off of his magical and rare skills while not rewarding him for it. 

Shockingly the company that he went to is where he still works and is still very well paid. They too are doing very well and continue to attract top talent.",3.0

3.	They have bad error handling like exceptions where it‚Äôs often hard to determine what error may occur in a situation.

I think that‚Äôs enough for the start. But to be clear, not only those languages are bad. C++ is also a terrible language in many aspects and object oriented programming in general causes more problems than it solves. But C++ still lets you decide what you do since it‚Äôs a superset of C. You can just use the C language with overloading and a bit (really not too much) templates and completely leave the standard library out.

Now that doesn't mean JS in itself is bad, it's just being squeezed out of its element.

I love Python. It has a flexibility and a versatility that few other languages can approach. When creating mockups, manipulating data for Machine Learning, or writing scripts that are too cumbersome to write in Bash, Python is a really useful tool. And I'm sure a lot of people make great use of Python in contexts where a different language would introduce an overhead in code clarity and usefulness.

But you still depend on a runtime and internally in a company this may not be a problem but I don‚Äôt like to require customers to install huge bloated software for a little script. That just annoys them. I think for most applications C with a tiny bit of C++ features is the most solid choice. 

Rust does some things quite nicely.

Yes, memory management tends to seem really tedious at first, but it's a pretty good trade for the robustness that it offers in exchange. In a way it kind of forces the programmer to write safe code because they have to handle any outcome in which a memory-related runtime fault might occur.

Even then, support, much less usage was way behind in IE/Netscape/Mozilla. Back then, remember, most people learned to code from printed books more than online, so there was a much longer lag time on new tech.

At the time, the only way to provide proper structure to a web site was with tables, exactly as you see here. We would massively nest them, play with column widths, heights, spans, etc. to align items, resize things. We used tables to do everything you do with divs, grids and flexbox now. Needless to say there was no such thing as ""responsive"" design.

Funny thing is there's still a ton of email clients that still don't properly handle divs (or was two years ago last time I went down that rabbit hole) so you still have to do the table-thing if you want true cross-compatibility with rich-html emails.

The thing is, this wasn't ""hard"" at all, it was just limiting, though you'd be surprised how far you can get with just raw tables.

fl8s19e,fnbs3y,"Yeah, I get what you mean. Basically this was a thing when Browsers were not that modern yet. The main problem was: Browsers weren't good at rendering things like the other. Every browser application was doing their own thing when it came to modern layouts. The table standard was invented very early in the history of the web, so this was something every browser implemented more or less correctly. Grids and Flexboxes weren't a thing.

Imagine building a website for some company. They like their coorperate designs and want it to appear the same on all browsers and devices. The easiest thing to do was actually using tables for the layout. There were ways around using tables but they did cost time and testing. It always felt a little ""hacky"" using extra stylesheets for internet explorer, firefox and what not...

But then so much changed: Mobile phones became more and more popular. But they had a massive difference to desktops: Their resolution wasnt even close to desktop monitor screens (width and height). Websites looked bad on small devices, when they were designed with tables. When HTML 5 and CSS 3 rolled out, this was a very important thing for the new standards: Having better ways to layout your website so they look good on every resolution. Every modern browser knows how to implement the W3C standards nowadays; even Internet Explorer (aka Edge) is doing a good job (well, it's a Chrome) 

Today tables should, imo, only be used for their intended being: Data. This is important that screen readers (for ppls that can't see) can better understand the website. If anyone uses the table-technique in this decade, they are either old developers and/or learned from wrong sources.

I hope I could give you a little light in that! Have a great start in the week. And don't forget to wash your hands :)

Two things kind of stood out in the presentation: 

it seemed a lot simpler to design a layout that started compact and then let itself spread out on a bigger (broader) display. 

He also made pretty heavy use of semantic html in the design process and it really made sense. 

When you're using your h1-3 tags and your aside tags etcetera consistently and using them for what they're semantically for it kind of rolls downhill into letting the design do its own thing and still make sense.

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",24.0
fkx4zvq,fl38nd,"No, Richard, it's 'Linux', not 'GNU/Linux'. The most important contributions that the FSF made to Linux were the creation of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a monumental achievement and has earned you, RMS, and the Free Software Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation.

Following are some reasons for you to mull over, including some already answered in your FAQ.

One guy, Linus Torvalds, used GCC to make his operating system (yes, Linux is an OS -- more on this later). He named it 'Linux' with a little help from his friends. Why doesn't he call it GNU/Linux? Because he wrote it, with more help from his friends, not you. You named your stuff, I named my stuff -- including the software I wrote using GCC -- and Linus named his stuff. The proper name is Linux because Linus Torvalds says so. Linus has spoken. Accept his authority. To do otherwise is to become a nag. You don't want to be known as a nag, do you?

(An operating system)¬†!= (a distribution). Linux is an operating system. By my definition, an operating system is that software which provides and limits access to hardware resources on a computer. That definition applies whereever you see Linux in use. However, Linux is usually distributed with a collection of utilities and applications to make it easily configurable as a desktop system, a server, a development box, or a graphics workstation, or whatever the user needs. In such a configuration, we have a Linux (based) distribution. Therein lies your strongest argument for the unwieldy title 'GNU/Linux' (when said bundled software is largely from the FSF). Go bug the distribution makers on that one. Take your beef to Red Hat, Mandrake, and Slackware. At least there you have an argument. Linux alone is an operating system that can be used in various applications without any GNU software whatsoever. Embedded applications come to mind as an obvious example.

Next, even if we limit the GNU/Linux title to the GNU-based Linux distributions, we run into another obvious problem. XFree86 may well be more important to a particular Linux installation than the sum of all the GNU contributions. More properly, shouldn't the distribution be called XFree86/Linux? Or, at a minimum, XFree86/GNU/Linux? Of course, it would be rather arbitrary to draw the line there when many other fine contributions go unlisted. Yes, I know you've heard this one before. Get used to it. You'll keep hearing it until you can cleanly counter it.

You seem to like the lines-of-code metric. There are many lines of GNU code in a typical Linux distribution. You seem to suggest that (more LOC) == (more important). However, I submit to you that raw LOC numbers do not directly correlate with importance. I would suggest that clock cycles spent on code is a better metric. For example, if my system spends 90% of its time executing XFree86 code, XFree86 is probably the single most important collection of code on my system. Even if I loaded ten times as many lines of useless bloatware on my system and I never excuted that bloatware, it certainly isn't more important code than XFree86. Obviously, this metric isn't perfect either, but LOC really, really sucks. Please refrain from using it ever again in supporting any argument.

Last, I'd like to point out that we Linux and GNU users shouldn't be fighting among ourselves over naming other people's software. But what the heck, I'm in a bad mood now. I think I'm feeling sufficiently obnoxious to make the point that GCC is so very famous and, yes, so very useful only because Linux was developed. In a show of proper respect and gratitude, shouldn't you and everyone refer to GCC as 'the Linux compiler'? Or at least, 'Linux GCC'? Seriously, where would your masterpiece be without Linux? Languishing with the HURD?

If there is a moral buried in this rant, maybe it is this:

Be grateful for your abilities and your incredible success and your considerable fame. Continue to use that success and fame for good, not evil. Also, be especially grateful for Linux' huge contribution to that success. You, RMS, the Free Software Foundation, and GNU software have reached their current high profiles largely on the back of Linux. You have changed the world. Now, go forth and don't be a nag.

fklpfik,fj6hpq,"The best way is probably just to integrate with some SSO provider rather than code your own.  But if you need to manage your own user accounts and passwords for some reason, the first step is to do the login validation on the server (which itself is too big of a topic to cover in a reddit comment), don't do it in javascript on the client.  And give the user a token or session id that authenticates them, don't simply redirect them to a 'secret' webpage that you hope nobody finds.",8.0
fkm84vm,fj6hpq,would you mind giving some sources that go in depth into login validation? I dont want my code appearing here,2.0
fkn3d4f,fj6hpq,"Login validation must be performed server side.  The very first step in providing a custom *authentication* (this is the word to search for if you want to do additional googling) is to encrypt all site traffic using TLS.  This is done using an SSL certificate.  Certs can be easily obtained using [https://www.sslforfree.com/](https://www.sslforfree.com/) of you own the domain.  After activating the SSL certificate on your web server, it's best practice to elevate all requests to HTTPS so all data is encrypted.

Next, your client needs to be able to provide the user's credentials to the server.  This is fairly simple, and can be done using form submission or AJAX.  If you're using AJAX, there are some considerations to be made regarding how you handle the authentication response (positive or negative).  You will typically only use AJAX if you are working on a single-page application.

Upon receiving the authentication request your server must validate the credentials supplied.  Generally this means looking up valid credentials in a database, which means the input has to be sanitized from any form of query injection.  Furthermore, **it is imperative that you do not store the password.**

**It is imperative that you do not store the password.**  Note that storing encrypted passwords is the same as storing passwords, encryption is reversible.  At the very least, the password should be securely hashed using an existing and well-valdiated hashing algorithm.  You shall not attempt to write your own hashing algorithm, unless you are doing so in collaboration with other academics who can validate your approach and can mathematically prove the algorithm has the desired properties.  Good hashing algorithms will create an irreversible output of fixed-width which does not expose character relationships.  Furthermore, it is good practice to provide additional salts to the hashing function.  Salting is the practice of concatenating additional characters to the value supplied to the hash function.  Salting helps to prevent tabular lookup of common passwords supplied to hashing algorithms.  The first salt you should add is a substring of the user ID, typically a username or email address; this provides distinction between users which have the same password.  Secondly, it is advisable to add a constant string as an additional salt as many people will use the same user ID and password combination for multiple services.  This constant string can be anything which is fairly distinct; an abbreviation of your business name is fine.

After validating the credentials of the user, the user should be issued an authentication token.  This token will be used to authenticate any and all requests which require authorization (sensitive data reads and all writes).  The server should generate a cryptographically secure string of characters.  This string may be kept in memory or persisted, either way it must be set to expire after some period of time.  It should then be sent to the client (again over TLS).  The client must store the token locally, typically in a cookie.  *This cookie falls under the necessary cookie clause of GDPR and does not require user consent.* [https://gdpr.eu/cookies/](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/)

Hopefully this clarifies it for you.  I know when I started web development it was difficult for me to find a comprehensive run down of how authentication should be implemented.  Most sources simply stated to use a 3rd-party authentication provider or an existing framework because it was too difficult to do.  The reality is that is isn't all that difficult, it's just quite involved and imperative that it's done correctly.  All the more reason we should be more transparent about the correct way to do it, in my opinion.",11.0

fklqvch,fj6hpq,Authenticating client side is really stupid. It will never be secure,3.0
fkm58dt,fj6hpq,I know a very small amount about security and you could at least use an md5 hash with a very long password. Encrypt any password that is typed in and compare to the encrypted hash.,2.0
fkn0j9e,fj6hpq,"Not on the client side, a hash is just as problematic there as a plaintext password.",3.0
fknpa0y,fj6hpq,most important concept to understand is not even hashing it is simply that anything you do client side is not secure. it is nothing more than a suggestion. the client is completely in control over what code runs on their machine.,2.0
fko6ooe,fj6hpq,"In the most basic sense, a webpage is split into the server side code (what run on the computer of the people hosting the site) and the client side (which runs on the computer visiting the site). When you go to a website, they send your computer the client side code so it can show you the site and run code that doesn't need help from the server to do. 

You can view the client side code sent to your computer and even edit how it runs on your computer (right click on a webpage and click ""view source"" or ""inspect element"" to see for yourself). 

In this example, someone could not only view the password, but even bypass the authentication and just go directly to ""target.html"" as if they had a correct password.

This is why you want to put authorization on the server side, only giving them access when you know they have the right credentials. (There's also needs to be a token and other stuff rather than just a webpage someone could type directly into the address bar.)",1.0

fjknse5,fdmr05,"Lots have changed in the past 8 years of the internet. ES6+ and browser's support for new feature implementation particularly.

One of the best parts of jQuery back in the day is that it allowed for stuff to work on all browsers, particularly IE6-8. `$.ajax` was huge for that, and was finding elements by css queries `$('.my-class')`.

But now that stuff can be done with vanilla javascript. the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) simplified making ajax calls. [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) being a native object. and `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll` added the ability to find elements via css query's just like jQuery did.

jQuery isn't bad. In fact, it was revolutionary. And the modern web wouldn't exist today without it. But jQuery is 15+ years old now. It's best features were more or less implemented natively, so the need for jQuery diminished heavily. It's still extremely useful for a lot of things, especially simple projects that don't need the overhead of the modern front-end frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Ember, etc...).

The code compiles and the current compiler gets updated.

Then you edit the code again, and remove this macro. However, due to this macro existing in the current compiler, every instance of the innocent code gets replaced with malicious.

Suddenly you have malicious code that spreads every time you compile something with that specific compiler and everything looks fine at source-code-level.

Of course not, it improves readability while providing functionality that would otherwise be cumbersome to replicate.

People have been working with ternaries for ages, tell me, what changed that suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúnot able to read them clearly‚Äù because just a few years ago everyone could?

We‚Äôre programmers. We already know shitloads of operators that are completely unreadable to most non-programmers (bitwise operators, anyone?), why would another one break anything or make anything worse?
It‚Äôs just the next thing we have to learn, next to the 200 libraries we still need to read the docs for and next to the thousands of functions and parameter orders we remember in nano-seconds for the 20 languages our stacks consist of.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, im all for dropping ternaries in favor of if/else constructs in expression-based languages.

And unless this variable is only going to be used in the context of user readable presentation and never have any logic based on its value (and some of the following apply even if it *is* only for presentation) then I would argue that using unicode strings like this has a few drawbacks :

1)they're hard to type  
2)unless you know the exact character by sight you're going to have to use a code pocker like [This one from Richard Ishida ](https://r12a.github.io/uniview/) to even know what you're looking at.  
3)it's not uncommon for several unicode chars to be visually difficult to distinguish leading to potentially dangerous ambiguities (remember, a human has to read that code to work with it and they can't tell chars like that apart as easily as the computer). 
4)it is guilty of ""getting fancy with it"" whose side effects include: added  technical debt and difficult to maintain code / error prone code. 

In fact, I will argue here that using anything outside of standard ascii in your source code (unless you are talking presentation string literals for special characters or for i18n purposes) is a sin.  
[Google seems to mostly agree with me on this one ](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s2.3-special-characters)

I worked on a project once where an Excel spreadsheet served as a short of database containing all of the information needed for a VBA addin to dynamically generate  the workbooks that would be what the end user was actually working with, it was essentially the source code for a very complex worksheet.  
The values in one column were parsed at runtime and  used to describe the formatting that the addin would apply to various ranges in the sheets it built.

femwb4z,epquw7,"&gt; A checkout page is just a form. Why does it need JavaScript?

If you phrase things that way, most of any part of a website doesn't *need* Javascript.  However, it's become the norm for the modern web to expect a degree of interactivity that's not possible with bare HTML and CSS, so if you want your checkout form UI to be consistent with the rest of your site, there's a good chance you're gonna need Javascript to do it.

&gt; how can I trust you not to be logging my keystrokes

Why would I care?  I'm *trying* to give you my credit card number, you don't need to log my keystrokes to get it.

&gt; How can I trust that one of the thousands of NPM packages you've bundled isn't logging my keystrokes?

It's theoretically possible, but in reality this is very unlikely.  You could slip a keylogger into an NPM package and maybe get it bundled into a lot of peoples' code before it was noticed, but if you actually try to send the collected data back to yourself it's going to be discovered pretty much immediately.

Meanwhile, if you're using a simple HTTP form to POST back to your server that means that *you're handling my credit card number on your backend*, which is a much, much bigger security risk than a hypothetical JS keylogger.  There's a reason modern payment processors discourage you from handling credit card numbers yourself.  If I'm buying something from some small-time website, I'm going to feel much, much safer with them embedding Javascript from their payment processor that collects and tokenizes my payment info than I would with them collecting my info themselves and sending it off to their server to do god-knows-what with it",6.0

fdcr995,ekhslw,"The only thing that is immutable is the contempt that programmers throw at other programmers who don't think like them.

Mutability in a language is a liability in the same way that a knife is sharp and can cut your food or you but can also cut you. You tell people never to pull or push the knife towards yourself because that is how you get cut, yet I've seen lots of people carelessly live dangerously in stubborn ignorance sometimes cutting their fingers but never stopping to think that they could cut their food without cutting themselves if they just stopped doing it wrong. Programmers are the same way. We give them a language where we tell them to use *encapsulation* and *separation of concerns* (the core tenets of OOP) such that you are not changing data you shouldn't, and yet daily I run across legacy code where hidden side effects in a method occur and this is considered ""practical"" and perfectly normal. It's fine until it's a bug and then I have to clean up their fucking mess because it's now costing us thousands of dollars per hour. (We had to ban the use of the word ""static"" in new code because of  bugs involving mutability that weren't thread safe.)

Immutability as a language feature seems like a great idea because you can't cut yourself with the knife any more. Since you can't alter someone else's variable, it's impossible to cause hidden side effects. This seems like a silver bullet for eliminating bugs altogether. It's still possible to write bugs, and you must now sometimes go to extra lengths to accomplish what in a language with mutability is a one-liner.  You should choose a language because it fits the problem you are trying to solve, and not because it seems to prevent a class of bugs.

All the hype of folks pushing for immutable object in languages that don't have them (like C#) are wrongly thinking it will make everyone better programmers by default. Their efforts would be better spent on teaching and insisting upon good OOP practices.",18.0

Like immutability?

It does often require a small change in thought process but it's this change which ends up pushing people towards safer code.

It's the same idea as with message passing vs shared memory in concurrency models. Message passing often requires a little more code but in the end it's so much less effort to get it right and so much easier to maintain. If you really need shared memory (or if you really need mutability), let the benchmarks be the first one to tell you before anyone starts microoptimising.",1.0

&amp;#x200B;

No, best industry standards is to implement some kind of naming scheme custom for your domain, but here are some ideas on how to be brief.

&amp;#x200B;

You are returning a bool, so start your function with ""Is"" that way people can know that you are returning a bool and not something else.

&amp;#x200B;

Also you have a public method, it is always good to signal to others publicly that this is in fact a public function. The correct way of doing this is to capitalize your function, regardless of language.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the important part, evenlySpaced is not as abstract in case you need to change the implementation of this function. Try instead

&amp;#x200B;

IsArgumentsWithinEquidistanceOfEachotherOrOneAnother

&amp;#x200B;

Also rename your params so function is easier to understand just by reading:

&amp;#x200B;

f307mqd,dezuwx,"In the name of keeping this shitty...

Let's start with a function, just to keep things organised.

    def cwrds(s):
        return # todo

""cwrds"" is short for ""(most) common words"", and ""s"" is for ""(input) string"".

Now the first thing we need to do is to look at all the words in the string, so we'll split the input into words and loop over it to get each word in sequence:

    def cwrds(s):
        for x in s.split():
            # todo

We need to find which one is the most common first, but before that we need to count them up. So to count each word, we'll need to go through the list of words again, find the words that equal the current one, then count how many that was.

    def cwrds(s):
        for x in s.split():
            sw=[]# start out with an empty list
            for y in s.split():
                sw += [y] if y == x else [] #add y if it is x
            c = sw.__len__()

Now we have the list of matching words in `sw` and the count of them in `c`. We don't need the list any more so let's ignore that. So that we can find the most common word, let's keep track of which value of c was the highest (let's call that `h`):

    def cwrds(s):
        h=0
        for x in s.split():
            sw=[]# start out with an empty list
            for y in s.split():
                sw += [y] if y == x else [] #add y if it is x
            c = sw.__len__()
            if (c &gt;h):
              h=c

Now that we know which one was the most common out of all of them, we can just scan the list of words again to find the one that was exactly that common and return it. To make things quick I've just copy pasted the word counting code:


    def cwrds(s):
        h=0
        for x in s.split():
            sw=[]# start out with an empty list
            for y in s.split():
                sw += [y] if y == x else [] #add y if it is x
            c = sw.__len__()
            if (c &gt;h):
              h=c
        for x in s.split():
            sw=[]# start out with an empty list
            for y in s.split():
                sw += [y] if y == x else [] #add y if it is x
            c = sw.__len__()
            if c == h:
                return [x, c]

Here I returned a list of `[x, c]` so that you know not only the word but also how common it was.

Example:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; cwrds(""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"")
    ['the', 2]

But we need to find all 5 most common words. Let's make a separate function to do that. **Here I'll assume we saved `cwrds` and still have it in the same file**

So to get the 5 most common, the easiest way is just to go 5 times in a loop, (get most common ‚Üí remove that from the string ‚Üí check if we have 5 yet, if not start again).

This one will be `cwrds_n` for ""(most) common `n` words"". First, let's set up that loop:

    def cwrds_n(s, n):
        r = []
        while len(r) != 5:
           r.append(cwrds(s))
           # ... todo
        return(r)

I still need to remove the most common word from the string each time. So let's do that. We just added the result of `cwrds(s)` to the end of `r`, so we can get it back with `r[-1]` (where -1 means ""last index""). This gives us the 2-value list, so we can get the word itself with `r[-1][0]`.

So we'll split the string into a list, remove the most common word from that list, and then feed it back into the loop.

In python removing something from a list only removes the first occurrence, so we have to keep looping until they're all gone. Once they're gone it throws an exception so we catch that and move on.

    def cwrds_n(s, n):
        r = []
        while len(r) != n:
           r.append(cwrds(s))
           ss = s.split( )
           try:
             while 1: ss.remove(r[-1][0])
           except:pass  # this stops the error from crashing python
           s=' '.join(ss) #put the new string back
        return(r)

Okay, so now we have cwrds and cwrds_n, let's try it out! I'll try it on another comment in the thread because I'm too lazy to write my own:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; cwrds_n(""You could iterate over the set of words and have a dictionary where the key is the word and the value is a number for the amount of times the word has been hit. In the loop, get the current count, increment, and store it back, then you could sort the keys in order of the value they have and even make the 5 a variable length."", 5)
    [['the', 11], ['and', 4], ['of', 3], ['a', 3], ['could', 2]]

Beautiful!!

/unshitty:

Yes, this code works. No, it's not a good example. This is /r/shittyprogramming so I've made it a perfect example of what not to do while programming.

I would categorise the types of shittiness on display as:

* Improper use of data structures (lists where we should be using tuples or dicts)
* Copy-paste coding (almost certainly a sign that you need to break it off into another function, but in this case it was only necessary due to shittiness in the first place)
* Bad choice of algorithms (I intentionally chose the slowest possible way I could think of to calculate this while still being plausibly believable code)
* Bad variable names. I should have called these functions something like `most_common_word` and `n_most_common_words`. And `x` and `y` say literally nothing about the contents of the variable. `s` and `ss` can be guessed at, but again I should have just named them after their purpose. People shouldn't have to guess.
* Catching all exceptions. Never do a try/except without having a specific exception in mind. You'll regret it when your program suddenly starts failing to report important errors and refusing to shut down cleanly.
* Inconsistent style. One of the returns looks like a function call. Unnecessarily brief `while 1`. `len()` vs the ridiculous `.__len__()`. Bracketed `if`. Unnecessary inline conditionals. Stingy with line breaks. Spacing and comments are all over the place. Speaking of which...
* Useless comments. The code is pretty hard to follow, but the comments themselves are a kick in the teeth. They explain on the most basic level what it's doing but still leave the reader confused as to why or what it really *means*.
* Poor spec. I've assumed ""words"" just means ""exact strings separated by whitespace"". You'd probably want to at least casefold them and remove punctuation before counting.

If you do write something like this in Python, a good place to start would be the `Counter` class in the `collections` module of the standard library.",32.0

f351adx,dezuwx,"Cool, but, I noticed some weirdness.


The key function for `sorted` is run on each element, so this will reverse each tuple and then sort the whole dict in ascending order.
Then the final slice will return the N *least* common elements.


Need to pass the `reverse` argument:
```python
sorted(Counter(s.lower().split()).items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]
```


and this doesn't really matter but I'd rather tell the computer to index a single value from a tuple rather than reverse the whole tuple, although I haven't tested if it's faster, it does make it simpler IMHO.


also [Counter.most_common()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter.most_common) *does* return the number of occurrences. It actually does everything the same except it doesn't sort ties, which should never be necessary.


So these two are equivalent:
```python
my_counter.most_common(5)
sorted(my_counter.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]
```
and the first one is more like pseudocode, therefore it's more pythonic? üòÖ

f29y0g4,dc05ml,"&gt; What would the harm be if a user space program gets crashed by unmanageable user input? 

I mean, it means your application is broken, first of all.

If it's a shared system, it's a denial of service issue.

A call stack overflow is an immediate panic, you know. You don't get a lot of opportunity to save user work or clean up connections.

In general, as an engineer, you should always avoid escalating a simple input error to an application panic, especially for a reason as silly as ""I can't think of a better way to toss out invalid input right now"".

You may think there are systems where you don't have to defend against hostile input, but you're the one making that assumption. You have to consider that the consequences could be catastrophic if you're wrong. The easiest way to avoid catastrophe is to just have good engineering practices whether or not you ""expect"" hostile input.

The worst bugs I see in software on a literal daily basis are bugs where an engineer assumed the input was trusted or that no user would ever do XYZ (or if they did do XYZ they were just stupid and deserved it). A user comes along with a perfectly legitimate reason to do XYZ and everything catches fire, and the engineer is the one holding the gas can.",1.0
f44ifoe,dc05ml,"&gt; The problem is that it calls itself recursively when there's an exception reading a keystroke.

* every time you move on to the next digit, double your running total (binary is base 2, so any specific digit is worth double the next, and the last one is worth 1)
* every time you hit a '1', add 1 to your running total (there are only two possible values, 0 and 1, so no need to convert the character to a numeric value like you might if you were to generalise this to larger bases)

Python demonstration:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; def parse_bin(bin_str):
    ...     total = 0
    ...     for char in bin_str:
    ...         total *= 2

    ...     return total
    ... 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_bin(""11010010"")
    210

To make an analogy to a more familiar number system: if you were parsing decimal and had already parsed ""52"", then found another character and saw it was ""523"", the step to get from one to the other is to multiply by 10 (the base) then add 3 (the next digit), which is essentially what is going on here but in binary.",15.0

evvn80u,cl85hh,"Uhh...usually no.  When something looks suspicious, I've found devs usually are trying to compensate by throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks that they got off of Google.  I usually ask the dev, ""does this work"" and then ask them to show me how it works.  Java is not a good language to just throw shit at the wall for because the compiler does not optimize the code, so it can be particularly dangerous to just let bad code run arrant.  By asking the two questions, it comes off unassumingly and you can usually start a conversation that helps the dev figure out where they went wrong.

As an example, I had a dev on a project refactor a branch of Terraform scripts by copying and pasting what I wrote in one environment into another environment.  I knew it wasn't going to work because the project being deployed was different in the two VMs and required different environment variables.  So we had a conversation and the dev realized what they had done and fixed it.

Another time, I had a dev make an HTTP call and not resolve the promise appropriately.  So I asked if it worked (which I knew it wouldn't), then the dev tested it out, found out it didn't work as expected, and fixed it on their own.  They didn't do it the way I would have done it, but they don't have to.  All I want them to do is not use bad practices that only work because they got lucky.  If a dev can't explain what something is doing then all likliness they copied and pasted code off the net that is doing twice as much as the dev thinks it's doing.",4.0

Depends on what you define as 'better off,' right?  After all, if we were to define a conversion of time to money as a direct analogue to one's quality of life, a lot of people would be making career decisions that simply don't make sense.  

The profit motive doesn't apply to, say, your local priest, who chooses to serve their church not because they want to make money but because they believe they're doing the right thing.  Many artists also do not follow the profit motive - they participate in capitalism to survive, but choose art rather than a higher-paying job path because their fulfillment comes from the work itself rather than from the cash it makes.

You could argue that fulfillment is itself a form of profit, but at that point you've just equated the profit motive with any form of positive feedback and you could define any economic or governmental system as a function of the profit motive, making it basically meaningless.",4.0

etxs7mp,cdgary,"Profit describes things like buying a house for 100,000 and selling it for 150,000.

Or buying a bunch of resource and having workers turn it into goods which then sell for much more than their value.

or buying a piece of wood and making and selling a chair for more than you put into it.

The reason the middle class always shrinks after a financial bust that causes a middle class explosion, is because the middle class is not actually profiting, as they fall behind the upper class.

If you made a chair worth $150 and you sold it for $100, you can't really be said to be profiting. You're incurring a loss, because you didn't break even in terms of value for the labor, or even get $160 dollars for it.

However, if you made only $100 dollars from that chair, it might allow you to live and eat for a week so you can produce 6 more chairs that week, and then a total of 30-31 chairs for a month.

And that's 3,000 dollars. That LOOKS good, but you're still making chairs strictly at a ""loss"" if the market value is $150.

Its simply that the loss you're taking in the value of the job vs the price you sold the good at isn't readily apparent to you, because you SEEM to be improving your lifestyle gradually through this conversion of work/time into money, which does more varied and useful things for you than owning that piece of wood and not turning it into a chair.

The reason that we can suggest this is as a loss is that if we assume a closed system of only say 10 people, and you're 1 person who is selling their product at a loss, then eventually the others will pull ahead in terms of how much capital they have on hand or in the bank, causing inflation in the market, making your capital even less valuable while you also were not making as much as you could have, and were taking minute but real losses.

Just because you gain money over time by working doesn't mean you're trading your life for a fair value or that you're making a profit.

Find me a company that buys resources for $1 and sells its finished product for $.50. That's essentially what you're doing as a wage earner.

That doesn't mean there's a better system available to anyone out there. It simply means that there's a lot of magical thinking in the idea that everyone profits by exchanges.

etiqrfy,cbuev1,"**Basic prerequisite Haskell knowledge:**

There is a type called ""unit"", written as an empty vector: `()`. It doesn't really do anything.

Lists are defined as either `[]` (empty list) or `x:xs` (some item `x` at the start of a list `xs`). 

**Explanation:**

The core of the `interval` function is the part

    iterate (([]:) . (&lt;$&gt;) (():)) (fail $ undefined)

For unimportant reasons, we can rewrite this as:

    iterate (([]:) . map (():)) []

`iterate f x` repeats the function `f` on `x` and puts each iteration in a list, thus generating `[x, f x, f (f x), f (f (f x)), ...]`. The function we pass to `iterate` is `(([]:) . map (():))` which basically takes a list of lists of units (let's say collection of lists for simplicity), adds an extra unit to each list, then puts an empty list into the collection.

We start with an empty list, so the iteration goes

    []
    ~&gt; [[]]
    ~&gt; [[], [()]]
    ~&gt; [[], [()], [(), ()]]
    ~&gt; [[], [()], [(), ()], [(), (), ()]]
    ...

Notice the length of the `n`th list is `n`, but also the `n`th list contains lists of every length between `0` and `n`.

The function `interval` takes two `Int` arguments: let's call them `a` and `b`. It grabs the `(b+1)`th list that `iterate` makes, which is going to be `[[], [()], [(), ()], [(), (), ()], ..., z]`, the last element `z` being a list containing exactly `b` units.

Now we convert each list of units to a `Int` by `length`, so we have the list `[0, 1, ..., b]`. Then drop the first `a` values, leaving us with the interval we want.

Then I garbled the syntax around.",11.0

eqb9ed7,bxpcr6,"Okay, I managed to understand what OP's code does. If you want to try and figure it out for yourself, don't read I guess.

The Hello\_World function use some dark magic (namely, inspecting the call stack live) from the sys module to get its own name as a string, replace the ""\_"" with "" "" to get the desired string ""Hello World"", reverses it, takes the character at index i, and appends str(a recursive call for i+1).

Now, the recursive call will eventually return None, so we get for example the string ""dNone"" for i=0. This is then imported as a module, which throws an exception which is caught by the except clause. We use str() on the exception, giving us something like ""No module named 'dNone'"". We check that the first character isn't in ""sl"" (this is important for the base case of the recursion), extract the ""dNone"" part, then extract the ""d"" and print it out the standard output.

To recap : Hello_World(i) calls itself recursively with i+1, then through complicated stuff, writes the i-th last character of ""Hello World"".

The base case of the recursion happens when i is too large to index into ""dlroW olleH"", throwing an IndexError, which is caught, str()ed, which results in ""string index out of range"". This is where the 'if' becomes useful, since that string's first character is in ""sl"". We then write an empty string to standard output.

In the end, since the recursive calls are made before the characters are printed, we get the characters of ""dlroW olleH"" printed backwards, giving ""Hello World"".

**TL;DR :** 'sys' module black magic fuckery;  throwing errors on purpose, catching them, then using the text of these errors; printing the text character by character through recursion.",12.0

Anyway bitwise operators are great when what you need to do is set a specific bit inside something like an integer.

something like this `status = mkdir(""/home/cnd/mod1"", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);` from https://linux.die.net/man/3/mkdir",3.0
enh1q9g,bogkjm,"Well here we're just code-golfing, I think everybody agrees that \`this.showExtent = !this.showExtent\` would be a better way to write this specific statement.

And in general, I think that the XOR operator should only be used when you actually want to express an exclusive or, or when you're doing some fancy bit-level magic. Aside from those cases, it's usually better for readability to just code what you mean :)",3.0
enj4v8i,bogkjm,"&gt; Now ^ is the XOR operator, that returns true if exactly one of its arguments is true.

That might have been true if `^` was actually a logical operator. The logical equivalent is `!=`, while `^` is bitwise-logical, which makes no practical difference when it comes to logic where true and false are just the integers 0 and 1, but makes a huge practical difference for the things one should actually use bitwise xor for, like toggling a specific subset of bits in a register.",2.0

emhc7f3,bkfx7u,The aggravated operator is completely new to me and now I want to know more about it.,5.0
emitph2,bkfx7u,"Here's the rundown:

When C was first created, not all keyboards used the same standard layout.  Some keys, like the pipe ""|"" or backslash ""\"", were not always available.  In order to work around this, [trigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphs_and_trigraphs#C) were created.  Trigraphs are groups of 3 common characters used to represent those less common characters. For instance: if your keyboard didn't have the pipe, then you can type ??! instead and C will treat them as equivalent.

C also has a feature built in called ""short-circuiting"", which means that if you type a logical expression like if(A||B), and A happens to be true, then C won't bother checking B, since the expression will be true whether or not B is true.

So the ""aggravated"" operator (doSomething() ??!??! abort()) works like this: ""??!??!"" is a trigraph expression for ""||"" (logical OR), and doSomething() is a function that returns 0 or FALSE if it fails.  Due to short circuiting, if the value returned by doSomething() is a logical TRUE value, then C won't bother executing abort().",9.0

eldmyjg,bfh8qg,This works because of how the compiler will try to optimize memory usage by reusing the memory that was previously allocated to scoped variables.  So when you declare a new variable it shares a memory location with the first declared variable from the previous scope.,97.0
ele0szp,bfh8qg,"This sounds very similar to a story my C++ instructor told me about a colleague's code. The guy forgot to return a value in his code but but the compiled program worked correctly because the assembly code generated by gcc would return whatever value was in some register and it just happened to be the same register as the data he wanted to return. It's not supposed to work, but it works in gcc. The code didn't work the same way when he compiled it with llvm-clang.

Some other languages have strange scope/return behavior if you're not familiar with them.

In Perl, the last expression of a subroutine gets returned, so having a return statement is optional.

In PowerShell, functions can return multiple objects and you don't have to explicitly say what type of object in the function signature. Any code that returns an object can end up on the pipeline and mixed objects can get weird. The way to avoid this is to prefix the function call with [void] as in the following:

    $sb = New-Object -TypeName ""System.Text.StringBuilder"";
    [void]$sb.Append(""Hello World!"")

Edit: spelling",37.0
elemshi,bfh8qg,"Just a note about perl - not only does it return the last expression's value, but a single term without any operations still counts. So yes, you can just slap `$returnValue;` in as the last line of your subroutine and it will be evaluated and returned.

This is also demonstrated with perl's named constants. Technically, it doesn't have any. In perl, ""named constants"" are actually subroutines spec'd to take no parameters and that return a constant value. `sub MYCONSTANT() { 1 }` will let you use `MYCONSTANT` anywhere _after_ that definition in your code, and the compiler optimises it into just `1` but it's still technically a subroutine. The `1` is the last evaluated value, and the last evaluated value is implicitly returned. If you want your subroutine to _actually_ not return a value, well... technically, you can't - it'll just return either `undef` in scalar context or an empty array in list context - but the closest you can get is a bare `return;` line without a value. And as noted, in list context it will _still_ return an empty list.

Bottom line: Perl doesn't really do `void` subroutines. Every single subroutine that doesn't terminate the script (`exit`, `die`, `exec`, etc) will return a value (for a given definition of ""value"" - [`undef` is the absence of a value](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/undef.html) but under `use strict 'vars';` the variable still exists once declared) when used in the right hand side of an assignment.

elevkyg,bfh8qg,"The next time you need to write a bash script that does a lot of processing on text strings or regular expressions, try using perl instead of bash.",8.0
eletzia,bfh8qg,"That's a tough one for me, honestly... I started in middle school myself, about sixth/seventh grade, and perl was actually the first or second language (excluding bash) that I learned. For reference, that was about a decade ago now. I learned mostly by reading (slightly but not _majorly_ outdated) programming manuals from my dad, looking at things online, and fiddling around on my linux box. If I were to try and help someone else learn now...

I'd probably say to focus on the core of the language itself first. Don't go diving into CPAN and the myriad modules people have made yet. Start with, if you haven't yet, perl's specific syntax and idiosyncrasies. Learn the ""quirks"" of writing it. `&lt;x&gt; or die $!` is a common perlism, and so is leaving off arguments because perl is pretty good at DWIM... which is confusing if you aren't used to it. Look at the end of the lines, because you can tag on flow control as a single-statement modifier at the end.

Don't be at all afraid of reinventing the wheel, either. Perl's whole _thing_ is that if you don't quite like the way this thing works, you can do it differently. Plus, it's a really good way to learn. I spent _months_ working with HTTP requests where I assembled the request and wrote it to the socket myself, then parsed the response for the headers. Then I found LWP (**l**ib-**w**ww for **p**erl) and I stopped, but I still learned how to use perl sockets from that.

Ask questions whenever you're unsure of something. Either metaphorically (read the [online docs](https://perldoc.perl.org) or run `perldoc -f &lt;function&gt;`) or literally, on SO or of a perl programmer you know. Hell, message me if you want. I might be able to help, and I usually check reddit daily or more.

That's about what I'd say to a newbie, anyway... as someone who's already looked into it and presumably has some coding experience, you can probably move faster / skip that first paragraph. Just try to get used to the language before you dive too deep, or you might get confused. (For instance, if you haven't heard of it or tried doing it yourself yet, writing a module needs a trick - you have to return a true value from the file or importing it will fail. So most modules these days just stick `1;` on the last line. Leave it out and things will break!)",3.0

No. A simple for loop can't order elements. The entire `OrderByDescending` idea is that you can add plugins to your array in whatever order you want. Which is great if plugins come from files that are not already ordered alphabetically in the order they need to be loaded.

&gt; Your code also attaches plugin ""0"" after plugin ""1"" which wouldn't work.

My code orders plugins by the plugin numbers which ideally you can artificially specify (better would be a dependency map). You did not load a plugin 0 at all in your example code so I assumed a plugin 0 does not exists.

If it's always 4 and always of the same type, why not actually store them in the order you want to load them?

&gt; That would just makes it slower and harder to read.

You are iterating over an array once to load plugins, whatever mechanism the loader triggers is going to dwarf the time this Linq query does to the 4 entries.

Linq is also not that hard to read. You can't really get more verbose than `OrderByDescending(o=&gt;o.ThisKey)` to order a list. It's almost identical to SQL (that syntax is also supported in LINQ)",-4.0

The more obvious way involves finding a square root and then taking its reciprocal, which are both computationally expensive.

eko84ih,bc2l7t,"I read an old story from the original Macintosh dev team that has one of my favorite of these. They wanted to draw circles and ovals quickly, so they needed to solve x^2 + y^2 = r^2 quickly. But the 68000 CPU didn't have hardware multiplication, so this formula was very slow. So the genius who wrote all the graphics drawing routines took advantage of this: the sequence of squares is the sequence of the sums of consecutive odd numbers. So

    int square(int x) 
    {
        int result = 0;
        int y = 1;
        if(x &lt; 0) {x = -x};
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) 
        {
            result += y;
            y += 2;
        }
        return result;
    }

This was hastily written on a phone, and it's the first C I've written in a couple years, might be buggy. :)

ekq5jgt,bc2l7t,"Good insight! It's useful primarily for graphing circles. It allows you to determine when the line of the curve goes up or down a pixel, so it's not really just 4^2 you want, but n^2 for integer n from 0 to 4, for example. Then this formula allows you to get the squares leading up to 4^2 for pretty cheap.

also I doubt I optimized that very well. I had a second go of it that doubled x (just a bit shift, so still efficient) then used that as the threshold for y to end the loop, eliminating the i counter, but I lost it and didn't feel like writing it again. 

edit: I looked at what you're saying again and you already optimized that bit for me, it sounds like.",3.0
ekqruyy,bc2l7t,"So after kicking your code around the office on slack, there were some questions, so I posted the insight above which was brought up by a coworker.  Eventually someone pasted this:

    bool inCircle(int x, int y, int r) 
    {
        int x2=0;
        int y2=0;
        int r2=0;
        if(x &lt; 0) {x = -x};
        if(y &lt; 0) {y = -y};
        if(r &lt; 0) {r = -r};
        int maxI = max(x, y, z);
        int z = 1;
    int result =0;
        for(int i = 1; i &lt;= maxI; i++) 
        {
            result+=z;
            if(i==x){x2=result;}
            if(i==y){y2=result;}
            if(i==r){r2=result;}
            z += 2;
        }
        return x2+y2&lt;r2;
    }

&amp;#x200B;

and he is doing exactly what you said above!  so this leads to O(5n) operations where n is the max of x, y, r.  I think this is still more expensive than finding them independently which would be 3 O(n) operations, or O(3n).  I know that in school they teach me that O(3n) == O(n), but I think it's clear that this is different.  So then we started discussing things like

&gt;""okay well is an if statement the same cost as an add statement?""

and then we all looked at each other like ""who fucking knows"" and moved on.

eko9rdv,bc2l7t,"My rudimentary understanding is that the key here is the ""union"" declaration. Union is like a stingy struct that is only able to store one value of its members at a time. If long is stored as a 32-bit value and double is stored as a 64-bit value, the entire union structure will take up 64 bits, swapping between the double and long as necessary. This means that both values would have the same allocated 64-bit memory space.

The initial value of the double does not necessarily matter, but it's important to remember how a double is stored. The first bit is the sign and the second part consists of 11 bits which represent the exponent == *e*. Finally, the third part consists of 52 bits for the fraction value == *f*. The way we obtain a decimal value is by computing -&gt; (sign) * 1.f * 2^e. 

Alright! Now that we have all of the important details covered, we can dig into what the code actually does. First we assign a value to **x.f**, taking up 64-bits. We now add a ridiculously large number to **x.i**:

Since union takes up the same 64-bit slot and both **x.i** and **x.f** share it, we're not really doing anything fancy here besides just adding this large binary number to what is already stored in that particular part of the memory (currently **x.f**). This behaviour is considered undefined as **x.i** is only supposed to be a 32-bit value (might even be compiler or system-specific), but for the sake of this example, we're only really concerned about the fact that **x.i** is using up the same memory space as **x.f** is.

This large binary value is tailored to increase the exponent part of the double by 1. This results in our output number being (sign) * 1.f * 2^(e+1) which is exactly the same as just multiplying the initial number by 2. 

Be careful though!! Printing **x.f** at the very end is still considered undefined behaviour because we were referring to **x.i** just before it. Luckily, in our case, we aren't doing anything too drastic and just abusing the fact that **x.i** and **x.f** share the same memory slot.

I hope this explanation was clear enough. I tested it out a bit before and it seems to make enough sense so I figured I would share if not for any other reason in order to provoke someone smarter into finding the courage to correct me.",29.0

    def multi(*args):
        return args[0] if len(args)&lt;2 else args[0]*multi(*args[1:])

    &gt;&gt;&gt; 

Arbitrarily short and stupid, but it'll serve the purpose.  

Suppose we needed to know what functions were called, when they were called, and what arguments they were given.  This would be useful in debugging the process, or simply tracking its progression.

To accomplish that though is going to make quite the mess of our tidy little program:

    def log_arrive(name,*args):
        print(name+' was called with (',*args,')')

    def log_exit(name, *args):
        print(name+' returned (',*args,')')
        
    def add(*args):
        log_arrive('add',*args)
        s = sum(args)
        log_exit('add',s)
        return s

    def multi(*args):
        log_arrive('multi',*args)
        m= args[0] if len(args)&lt;2 else args[0]*multi(*args[1:])
        log_exit('multi',m)
        return m

    def main(*args):
        log_arrive('main',*args)
        x = add(multi(1,2,3,4),multi(5,6))
        log_exit('main',x)
        return x

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(main())

and we'll get:

    =============== RESTART: decorators.py ===============
    main was called with ( )
    multi was called with ( 1 2 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 2 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 4 )
    multi returned ( 4 )
    multi returned ( 12 )
    multi returned ( 24 )
    multi returned ( 24 )
    multi was called with ( 5 6 )
    multi was called with ( 6 )
    multi returned ( 6 )
    multi returned ( 30 )

    add returned ( 54 )
    main returned ( 54 )
    54
    &gt;&gt;&gt;         


Expressive, but look at what we've done to those short little functions now!

Not only are they much less clear than before, they also had to have their logging customised for each one.

Decorators are essentially wrappers to a function, which can let you modify what happens when the function is called, without having to mess with the insides of that function at all.  You get to do stuff just before the function is called, just after it was called, and can mess with its arguments and/or results as desired.

So to implement our logging as above, we simply change the original short program to this:

    def logger(func):
        def log(*args):
            print(func.__name__+' was called with (',*args,')')
            ret = func(*args)
            print(func.__name__+' returned (',ret,')')
            return ret
        return log

    @logger
    def add(*args):
        return sum(args)

    @logger
    def multi(*args):
        return args[0] if len(args)&lt;2 else args[0]*multi(*args[1:])

    @logger
    def main():
        return add(multi(1,2,3,4),multi(5,6))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(main())

and calling it will get us:

    =============== RESTART: decorators.py ===============
    main was called with ( )
    multi was called with ( 1 2 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 2 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 4 )
    multi returned ( 4 )
    multi returned ( 12 )
    multi returned ( 24 )
    multi returned ( 24 )
    multi was called with ( 5 6 )
    multi was called with ( 6 )
    multi returned ( 6 )
    multi returned ( 30 )
    add was called with ( 24 30 )
    add returned ( 54 )
    main returned ( 54 )
    54

The same as before, but now we don't have to clutter the functions at all.  plus, we need only one line before the call rather than two lines inside it.  And we can return a statement directly rather than having to evaluate it to an expression, assign it, log it, and then return it.

In this example, it hardly saves much, 22 lines vs 26.  Take it to a bigger scenario, say we had 100 functions that needed logging.  The decorator adds 1 line per, so +100 lines.  The other approach adds 2 or 3 lines, so +200 to +300 lines.

Had those functions been lambdas, its even more extreme!  You lose some syntactic sugar(@ notation doesn't work with lambdas) and `func.__name__` will not be the name anymore, rather it will be `&lt;lambda&gt;`, but you can still use the exact same decorator code.  I added the named argument name to be able to match the above outputs exactly once again, at the cost of requiring customisation per decorated lambda.

So if we wanted to log lambdas and still have the same control over them:

    def logger(func,name=''):
        def log(*args):
            print((name if name else func.__name__)+' was called with (',*args,')')
            ret = func(*args)
            print((name if name else func.__name__)+' returned (',ret,')')
            return ret
        return log

    add = logger(lambda *args: sum(args),name='add')

    multi = logger(lambda *args: args[0] if len(args)&lt;2 else args[0]*multi(*args[1:]),name='multi')

    main = logger(lambda :add(multi(1,2,3,4),multi(5,6)),name='main')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(main())        
        
And now we are even shorter than before, just 16 lines total with logging, and still the same output as above.

Whats more, for recursive lambdas, you **can't** log their recursions without a decorator/wrapper, or abusing python's overly eager execution style to allow for it.  Leveraging the eagerness of python permits such absurdity as:

    multi = lambda *args: (   print('multi was called with (',*args,')'),    args[0] if len(args)&lt;2 else args[0]*multi(*args[1:])   )[1]

    &gt;&gt;&gt; multi(1,2,3,4)
    multi was called with ( 1 2 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 2 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 3 4 )
    multi was called with ( 4 )
    24
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 

That will allow you to at least log the incoming arguments, but in this case, using prints which have no return, you either cannot log the returns or you cannot have the results.  To have both you'd need to make the recursive call for both logging and return, but the arrival doesn't know which is which, logs everything, and chaos ensues.

Is all this correct about Python? If so, is there really much of an advantage to `[]` syntax vs `()` syntax? This all intrigues me.",1.0

I actually hadn't realised generator expressions were a thing for a start, so my choice of [] was one of not realising there were an alternative....  I knew of generator functions, just not the expressions.

Still, having read up a little, filling in some things I didn't know, I think I can provide some answer, though I too would welcome someone more versed than i weighing in, should anyone happen by....

Python doesn't do lazy eval, but generators can fake it by delaying the work until its demanded of them.  They also only provide one element at a time (and do not keep the previous elements) versus the complete set.  This means generators will obliterate other expressions for memory footprint.  It also means they can handle effectively infinite sets, because they don't need to produce the whole set, just another element everytime they are asked.  Note that infinite productions are still quite plausible if the loop doesn't stop asking for values expecting it to end instead.

Performance is nearly identical either way, since the means of generating the next element is often the same, or a bit less efficient, than just producing the complete set in one go.

Iterators stand inbetween with being completely evaluated on execution, but implementing generator like syntax such as .next().

So list comprehension, or generator expression, sum was going to receive the same number of values, and both expressions were going to do essentially all the same work.  But we don't actually need the list after the fact, and sum doesn't care if the values arrive all at once or one by one through a generator.  Generator wins I would think.

For the task above, either is suitable.  Sure the generators are smaller, but neither presents a notable demand for memory.

All that said, I think you are correct in having expected the generator expression.  If you need the list, go for the comprehension.  I didn't need the list though, just the result of having sum do work on it, so a generator it should have been.",1.0
ekoisb6,bbm8xx,"This is good insight, thanks!

So you have some context on what 'faking lazy eval' provides in other languages, so you have some idea on what (it sounds like) generators provide:

I know that lots of external IO processes can rely heavily on lazy-evaluation of generator objects. Python's generators seem, to me, to be the perfect implementation of receiving IO streams - from files, hardware, whatever. 

There are also situations I'm aware of in webdev-world where the actual generator *Object* can be created, mutated, and then evaluated only once mutations are finished - a good example is database queries, where two classes might know two separate things about the query: one knows about ordering, and one knows about filtering, and each can mutate the DB query separately before some parent class evaluates it. (You can imagine how applying a filter *before* the query is valuable here.) And then, hey: once you have a generator object representing your query instead of a raw list of data, you might as well pipe it into an HTTP response which just reads straight from the database's output stream! (Not always ideal, but I like streams in general.)

I think you're on point about   
&gt;we don't actually need the list after the fact  

though - all this only works if you manage to keep your various functions/classes caring about one datum at a time, and agnostic to the list as a whole.",1.0

The variables GET,SET, etc are declared earlier as numbers.

`__(SET)` returns a function that sets a value. This gets called with `(""someVar"", ""Hello!"")` which in turn returns the `__` function again. Rinse and repeat.

[It's very similar to method chaining in jQuery](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/jquery-tutorial/jquery-chaining.php) but instead of returning an object with functions it returns the function itself.
The linked example does `$(""p"").animate({width: ""100%""}).animate({fontSize: ""46px""}).animate({borderWidth: 30});` but if jQuery would return the ""animate"" function instead of itself, it would look like this: `$(""p"")({width: ""100%""})({fontSize: ""46px""})({borderWidth: 30})`.

This is not abusing at all, it's just formatted in a way to look like it does.

I love `stty raw` for unsecured terminals.  harmless, but damn will it fuck them up for a bit.  `stty cooked` to undo.

My most persistent though was abusing `~/.bash_logon` `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.bashrc` together with an identical prompt command and function in each, such that every prompt instance called a function which checked all three files to ensure the prompt command and function were intact and sourced. The prank itself was `exec &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1`

Most people assume their terminal is just non responsive.  We do nearly all our CPSC work at the terminal, and many use putty from a windows machine to get there, further enforcing terminal usage.

If you don't fix all three files, and source them, in a single command instance, one of the surviving instances' command prompt call restores any damage you've done to the prank.

Not especially difficult to solve once you know what is going on, but very irritating, and will definitely trip people up for a bit.

immediately open emacs, and stay in there until its finished.  You can navigate the directories, get listings of the files within, and open, edit, and save files all without every returning to the prompt.",2.0

At the one university, they left us the write command, which is awesome.  

I wrote a bash script to relentlessly spam a target user with messages, one per interval(tenths of a second up to int max), for a number of repetitions(up to int max).  If the messages arrive quickly enough, you're effectively locked out of you're terminal because before you can exit the message chat, the next one is already queued up.

the best part is that because I targeted a user, and not a tty, it defaulted to the active session.  This meant that whatever session they were active in received the messaged, so I don't have to figure out which of your open sessions needs to be targeted.  Touch the keyboard in another session, it becomes active and becomes the new target.  This rendered it impossible to get work done, touch the keyboard and you get buried in messages.  I could simply spawn another session and carry on working.

placing `if [ $? -gt 0];then exit` in their .bashrc prompt command is fun.  If any program exit code is anything other than zero, ie, not successful, the terminal session is terminated.

In computing, quadruple precision (or quad precision) is a binary floating point‚Äìbased computer number format that occupies 16 bytes (128 bits) with precision more than twice the 53-bit double precision.

This 128-bit quadruple precision is designed not only for applications requiring results in higher than double precision, but also, as a primary function, to allow the computation of double precision results more reliably and accurately by minimising overflow and round-off errors in intermediate calculations and scratch variables. William Kahan, primary architect of the original IEEE-754 floating point standard noted, ""For now the 10-byte Extended format is a tolerable compromise between the value of extra-precise arithmetic and the price of implementing it to run fast; very soon two more bytes of precision will become tolerable, and ultimately a 16-byte format ... That kind of gradual evolution towards wider precision was already in view when IEEE Standard 754 for Floating-Point Arithmetic was framed.""In IEEE 754-2008 the 128-bit base-2 format is officially referred to as binary128.

I mean a more serious approach would of course involve not sending a nine unit boat to do one unit worth of work. However, you also have to consider crew and fuel costs do not scale linearly. Oh and as anyone who has done routing and capacity planning can tell you it isn't the outgoing cargo that matters it is the return trip. So what you really need to know is the city pairing and the dates needed so that you can optimize the return trip cargo capacity. It will cost a fair bit to get access to international spot market but nothing is as bad as shipping empty. Also you are going to have to consider third party shippers so look at integration with an [api](https://apidocs.spotworx.com/#clienttransportorder). Oh and you also have to consider port fees. There are ports where it is cheaper to ship in stuff to a neighboring country and overland it to the port city.

A loop-switch sequence (also known as the for-case paradigm or Anti-Duff's Device) is a programming antipattern where a clear set of steps is implemented as a switch-within-a-loop. The loop-switch sequence is a specific derivative of spaghetti code.

It is not necessarily an antipattern to use a switch statement within a loop‚Äîit is only considered incorrect when used to model a known sequence of steps.  The most common example of the correct use of a switch within a loop is an inversion of control such as an event handler.

ec7mdiq,a7x0qs,"Can't you just have a lookup table for the (let's stick to languages with an alphabetic writing system for this one) language at hand and sort based on that?

I only know Russian and Japanese, but both of those (hang on, hang on, Kanji can be written phonetically and often in public places the Kanji are accompanied by small superscript hiragana to help the less literate sound out complex or unfamiliar Kanji, [It's called Furigana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana?wprov=sfla1) ) have a proscribed order to their alphabets. Same goes for Arabic and Farsi and Hebrew (letters literally correspond to numbers there, I think)

Not sure what you'd do with Chinese, or for languages that don't have a written script. But I'd bet you dollars to donuts a Chinese speaker could tell you how to alphabetize a list of names.

Fill the gap in my knowledge here, /u/CodenameLambda? ",7.0
ec7t2h9,a7x0qs,"I mostly meant doing it programmatically, which is no easy task. For example, Japanese: most Kanji have different readings (they do fall into two categories, but more often than not each of those contains multiple readings too), so you can't even just have a simple dictionary from Kanji to reading (and there are about 2000 widely used Kanji or so). And if that isn't enough, there are compounds that have multiple readings too: ÁßÅcan both be read as „Çè„Åü„Åó(watashi), or „Çè„Åü„Åè„Åó(watakushi), and (since those couldn't actually disrupt an ordering) ÁîüÁâ©can be read „Åõ„ÅÑ„Å∂„Å§(seibutsu) or „Å™„Åæ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ(namamono), which actually have different meanings too. So even if you store the reading of *every word*, you have to either guess the context or just ignore words like these. &lt;- take everything there with a grain of salt, I am not natively speaking Japanese, and have only little experience with it. 

I mean sure, if you have an actual translator working for you, you might as well let them figure out the order, if it isn't trivial to solve programmatically. But that does result in larger programs, if you ship all translations (but not by much anyway, the actual translations are probably way more expensive to store). 

And while you are right regarding other alphabets, most programmers know just the Latin one, so I can kind of understand not implementing others correctly (although there are probably good libraries for that, at least to some degree, see Japanese). 

But for a decent chunk of languages, just comparing the unicode ids after making them lowercase with a unicode aware function actually works for a lot of languages, you get some irregularities (like Umlauts and the like being at the end, although they are (usually, there are multiple options) treated like their counterparts without dots in German &lt;- this doesn't have to be taken with a grand of salt, since that is actually my native tongue), but it *usually* works correctly. It isn't by any means something you should do in production, but it works good enough for making prototypes and the like (as long as the higher ups don't decide to ship the prototype as is). 

Basically, it boils down to: languages are hard. Really, really hard. If you can escape them, *run as fast as you can*.  

Edit: i forgot that names in Japanese are a *mess*. If you have to deal with those without their reading attached, good luck. You'll need it. ",4.0
ec84eb2,a7x0qs,"I get you!

The idea of using a unicode table never occurred to me, but, if I read you right, of course the unicode table will be in a ""more correct"" order because it was put together by users of that language for users of that language, right? ",2.0
ec8egff,a7x0qs,"As I said, that solution isn't correct, because some languages share parts of their alphabet, while those extensions are somewhere else in the unicode standard. 
And I'm not even sure if alphabetical order inside unicode blocks is guaranteed. Probably not. ",1.0
ec84vcy,a7x0qs,"Just struck me, there's also the matter of letters that can't ever be used to start a word or to stand on their own, as well.

Like in Cyrillic there's the letter [myagki znak](https://www.livinglanguage.com/community/discussion/815/myagkiy-znak-soft-sign-and-tvyordyy-znak-hard-sign-in-russian) which is really more of an accent than a phoneme and never appears alone in a word. Despite that, it's right there in the alphabet. I wonder what a Russian or Ukrainian speaker would say about how that affects alphabetization. ",2.0

ec16fik,a76q46,"Holy shit. I used Finale Notepad back in the day when I played instruments for fun, like 2009-2012, and I hated it. It was ugly and so slow to use, and had it's own share of bugs. Some of the options were unresponsive, it absolutely refused to allow any variation or extra notes in a measure, it was like a temperamental prison guard who would always enforce needlessly strict rules and yet sometimes didn't do anything at all. I thought Sibelius was the premium software that worked well and which professionals used. How else could anyone compose anything if they didn't have decent software to write it with? 

I transcribed a few 4-hand songs down to 2 hands, but my enthusiasm really ran out after many of the evenings of tinkering would yield minimal results. Miss a note somewhere? Good luck putting it in, because you'll have to re-arrange everything after it! Want to add markings? Maybe it'll work. Add lyrics? Aww hell no; if it had a proper way to do that I never figured it out. And most of all, the process of adding every single note was just so damn slow! I can tell when someone used Notepad, because they'd rather slur three with notes together than slur an eitgh note with a quarter note. And adding rests? Somehow those were bugged. You know the strictly-enforced rules I mentioned before? If you wanted to swap the length of an eight note and a quarter note, the program would NOT let you have the wrong timing in the measured you can't start by making the eight note longer - the measure would be too long! So you make the quarter note into an eight note. Now the measure is too short! So it automatically adds an eight note rest. Changing that eight note to a quarter note... no, the extra rest was added, you're making it too long! So now you need to delete that automagically-added rest and your next clicks MUST be to change that eight note to a quarter note. Any deviation from that workflow will result in the re-addition of that rest. Why won't it let you just leave the rest of the measure blank? Because fuck you, it must be explicitly declared blank in proper sheet music notation! You were already allowed your one click to select the note length before the rests are automatically adjusted again, and that's pushing your luck

Oh, and about those slurs - the built-in digital piano that you could use to sample the music didn't recognize them at all. It would play notes as written without recognizing the slurs at all. So good luck getting that preview to sound exactly right.

ebwz90a,a6no0w,"You have to provide a valid pointer to double because the underlying algorithm uses it to compute the integral part. 
According to cppreference, here's how it is implemented :

    double modf(double x, double* iptr)
    {
    #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
        int save_round = std::fegetround();
        std::fesetround(FE_TOWARDZERO);

        std::fesetround(save_round);
        return std::copysign(std::isinf(x) ? 0.0 : x - (*iptr), x);
}

If you pass a nullptr, the following lines will not be valid : 

    *iptr = std::nearbyint(x);
    [...]
    return std::copysign(std::isinf(x) ? 0.0 : x - (*iptr), x);


You can re-create the function and make it use an local double to store the integral part. Either modify this one, or wrap the standard function inside your own.

By the way, there's no reference involved here. modf asks for a pointer to double, not for a reference (that is, an address which point to a place where you can store a double).

**Scenario 1:**
User fills out a form on a website.  They spend an hour filling out the fields perfectly and they are ready to submit the form. The form being part of a MV(W) application automatically detects the changes and saves the data in the background.  

Unaware of this technology, the user attempts to save the form but because there is no save button they become agitated.  They are unaware their changes have been saved and they begin to escalate in anger.  They run to the break room screaming about their data and inexplicably slap an ice cream cone out of Karen(from accounting)'s hand.  It's OK, no one likes her.

They run into the parking lot and slash a bunch of tires with the rationale that no one should leave work before he can confirm his data is saved.  Eventually they are shot with a tranquilizer in a 13 hour stand off in front of the backup generators since he thinks they will prevent his data from being loss.  Unaware the FBI has already confiscated and searched his work PC in the process closing the browser, which was irrelevant anyways since the data was saved.

**Scenario 2:**
Exact same set up, except in this case there is a fake Save button on the form which throws up a progress bar for half a second.  The user sees the bar and is relieved his data is saved.

**Scenario 3:**
Same set up as one but the situation is defused before the user can escalate because there was birthday cake in the break room.  Yum.

(Side note: Kudos to the FBI for their quick response time.)

Scenario 2: to me, this is still bordering on dark design patterns as it is leveraging user comfort instead of applying an evolved design that both optimizes and informs the user of optimizations. In all of these, it would seem that the question should not be about how to keep a user complacent and complicit, but rather how to most effectively communicate to user that the internet is evolving...

I even had a note after the gag saying it was a gag, but everyone is too stupid to read that note even when they do elaborate responses to my writing. Even more telling was when people said this was stupid, I'd feign ignorance further and ask, ""Wait, so why doesn't Python 3 support Python 2 then?""

I've used this on occasion in user interfaces early in development, where we were using a UI with mock data because the backend hadn't been written yet. Users would see it with the mock data and that would set their expectations for performance / responsiveness of the application, even though it wasn't actually doing real work. So we decided our mockups needed to start including speedup loops that we could take out as we wired the UI up to the real backend, keeping the performance roughly equivalent as we went from what was basically a mockup to the real thing.

What always got me though is that people would complain about how slow the system was. A year earlier they'd spend an hour manually writing up a report. Now they spend most of the hour complaining about how slow the system is because it took 8 seconds to deliver the same report.",8.0

eblafj1,a52bj8,"Actually, data is lighter than air.  All you need to do it put into special packets that can then be released from the roof to transfer to the cloud.  It is much more efficient to transfer data that way than to transfer it in bulky, heavier than air containers for processing at earth or sea based processing centers.  While some may argue that putting so many resources up there is clogging the sky, the benefits outweigh the costs for the time being.

However, the problem with this is that getting the finished data back from the cloud is difficult to say the least.  Every time someone needs to get data from the cloud, the cloud has to send it back down in the form of water (its just easier to use resources already up there to trap the data in a heavier-than-air container).  However, there is no easy way to determine whose data is whose, so they just do a kind-of ""data bukkake"" over an area where people are requesting the data in the form of rain.  This way, you eventually get the data back.

Because of the inherent inefficiency of this process, it may be the case that we will switch over to earth or sea computing once we have enough containers to handle all our data transfers, but for now we will have to deal with cloud computing.",2.0

ebhk9ie,a4sz97,"Technically, I think it does count as a pseudo-AI, due to the fact that it has a knowledge base (for this ""AI"", it's tic-tac-toe), kind of like how you yourself have a knowledge base (the world around you).  But you also have an understanding of the world, the AI doesn't, so it's also technically not a true AI.  If that makes any sense to you?

However, I also think that there's no such thing as a true AI that currently fits the definition of AI due to the fact the current AI only has **knowledge** about subjects, but not **understanding**.  For instance, you know and understand that by the definition of learning, you mean the process by which you take in information and adapt it to fit your needs based upon prior knowledge and understanding, but an AI, in its current form, can only adapt information based upon prior knowledge and cannot adapt based upon prior understanding. 

So you **know** that to play tic-tac-toe well, you need to pick a strategy that gets you to win most of the time.  When you lose a round of tic-tac-toe, you **understand** that your strategy was either not the most optimal, and you can adjust it by what you now know.

The AI I built, **knows** how to play tic-tac-toe well enough to an extent that it can tie you in a game, or best you if you're not careful.  But, the AI doesn't **understand** how to adapt it's newfound **knowledge** of a loss into a new strategy and will try the same strategy over and over for every game.

I don't think that my AI is a true AI by any means since with the AIs that can play chess and go, the can implement a basic form of understanding, whilst my AI cannot. 

 [SmaterEveryDay - backward bike video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0) on YouTube has a better explanation of knowledge vs understanding that isn't so bulky.

In my actual write-up (the README) I call it a pseudo-AI, as in ""controlled by the computer via a program AI"", not an AI in the true sense of the meaning.  I'm stretching the definition of what an AI is quite a bit here.

&amp;#x200B;

You're using ECB mode encryption, which only n00bs do.

&amp;#x200B;

You should use counter mode (Don't use GCM, it's deliberately complicated so they can hide backdoors. Also: Galoyce? what are we, commies?).

&amp;#x200B;

We also have to add nonce to it to make it secure.

    function encrypt(x, key) {
        var encrypted = """";
        with_nonce = ""nonce"" + x;
        counter = 0.0; // Make sure it's a real Number because someone said JS ints a small
        for (var char of with_nonce) {
            encrypted += String.fromCharCode(char.charCodeAt(0) ^ key ^ counter++);

You can see how important the nonce is:

        this.userKey = 0xaa; // Key for 06-12-2018, made by keygen (c) Donald Davison 2008

            return decrypted;
        };

    window.user_auth_map.constructor = null;
 
    // Finally delete this script from memory
    document.getElementById('user_auth_script_block').src = 'about:blank';

Now if someone calls `console.log(window.user_auth_map)` what do they get? `[object Object]` my friend, nothing more. `alert(window.user_auth_map)` is worse than unhelpful, it bounces them off the site altogether! Even smartasses who try `window.user_auth_map.constructor.toSource()` will find themselves *sorely* disappointed. But you can just call `for (var i in window.user_auth_map) { console.log(i); }` right? Wrong! Properties made by `Object.defineProperty` aren't enumerable by default!

It's perfect and uncrackable, and even better it is safe for HTTP (public sector customer requirement) as the passwords are transmitted encrypted on the wire and the user's password entry is never sent back to the server (the code simply makes a POST with `passwordVerified=yes` when they log in.)

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you‚Äôre referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I‚Äôve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.

Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine‚Äôs resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",4.0

Python `if` statements works the same as in other languages.

    // JS equivalent
     var day = ' February 14 ';
     if(day) {
        // do stuff here.
     }

It just uses a colon (`:`) and an indentation of the code block to represent the curly braces `{`.

Since the variable `day` is considered `truthy`, we can ignore the comparison of like length, or size of variable.

eb44qqk,a2s6q5,"So part of the dynamic languages and duck typing is to simplify code and reduce the amount of code written due to types. Instead the focus in dynamic languages is the intent of the code, and what the underlying values of the objects represent.


So as a simple example, let's say I have a screen on a web page that says, ""Welcome Eric"", where the user puts in their name. In the database, the name field is a string, and allows for nulls. 

For the null case, and the empty string case,  we want it to say ""Welcome Guest"" instead.

* null - Guest
* '' - Guest
* everything else - their name

So forgive my C#, it's a bit rusty. 

    if(name != null  &amp;&amp; name.Length &gt; 0) {
      return name;
    } else {
      return ""Guest"";
    }

The equivalent python script

    if name:
        return name
    else:
        return ""Guest""

Since we really don't care that the variable name is a string, we just care that we have a name.

Depending on your line of work or project, the types may certainly matter, critical even.

For some languages like Python, it tries to optimize for programmer time:

ea5035o,9ysoya,"And why not? Many languages support this, *including* [JavaScript](https://repl.it/repls/JumpyAgileOutliers):

    let foo = [1, 2, 3]

    function get_foo() { return foo }

    get_foo()[0] = 'one'

    console.log(get_foo())

Along with [Python](https://repl.it/repls/MadWarmSorting), and [Java](https://repl.it/repls/CyanTurboZettabyte).

In [C/C++](https://repl.it/repls/PalatableHorribleLicense), with pointers, you can even assign to (mostly) arbitrary expressions, so long as the pointer types are correct:

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
    int main() {
      int foo[] = { 0, 1, 2 };
    
      foo[0] = 9;
      *(foo + 2) = 99;
    
      for (int i=0; i&lt;3; i++) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; foo[i] &lt;&lt; "" "";
      }
    }

In [C#](https://repl.it/repls/AccurateDarksalmonCore) with ref returns, you can even assign directly to method calls:

    using System;
    
    class MainClass {
      private static String[] foo = new String[]{ ""0"", ""1"", ""2"" };
    
      public static ref string GetFirst() { 
        return ref foo[0];
      }
    
      public static ref string GetLast() {
        return ref foo[2];
      }
    
      public static void Main (string[] args) {
        GetFirst() = ""9"";
        GetLast() = ""99"";
    
        Console.WriteLine(String.Join("" "", foo));
      }
    }

You can use as complicated an expression as you want in the left-hand-side of the assignment, like in this (horrifying) [Kotlin](https://repl.it/repls/ShamelessHumongousComputer) example:

    val foo = mutableListOf(0, 1, 2)
    val bar = mutableListOf(3, 2, 1)
    
    val arr = ""bar""
    val ind = ""zero""
    
    when(arr) {
      ""foo"" -&gt; foo
      ""bar"" -&gt; bar
    }[
    when(ind) {
      ""zero"" -&gt; 0
      ""one"" -&gt; 1
      ""two"" -&gt; 2
    }] = 99
    
    println(foo)
    println(bar)

No, the issue is that `toCharArray` returns a *new* array every time. Assigning to `toCharArray()[0]` works just fine, but you lose the reference to that *new* array immediately, so it's lost. The way you get around that is by saving that new array as a variable first, then setting the value in that *reference* to the new array.

It's got *nothing* to do with what's on the left-hand-side of the assignment.",2.0

e9w7p9m,9xvchp,"**Java applet**

A Java applet was a small application that is written in the Java programming language, or another programming language that compiles to Java bytecode, and delivered to users in the form of Java bytecode. The user launched the Java applet from a web page, and the applet was then executed within a Java virtual machine (JVM) in a process separate from the web browser itself. A Java applet could appear in a frame of the web page, a new application window, Sun's AppletViewer, or a stand-alone tool for testing applets. 

Java applets were introduced in the first version of the Java language, which was released in 1995.

Essentially each ""place"" in the string 0b0000 represents a checkbox. So 0b0000 is 4 checkboxes.

0b1000 means only the first checkbox is checked.

0b0100 means only the second checkbox is checked.

0b1111 means all of the checkboxes are checked.

e9z2vp4,9x38hu,"From ""Appendix A: The Awful Parts"" of *Javascript the Good Parts* by Douglas Crockford:

&gt;### Bitwise Operators

&gt; JavaScript has the same set of bitwise operators as Java:

&gt; `&amp;`    and

&gt; `|`    or

&gt; `^`    xor

&gt; `Àú`    not

&gt; `&gt;&gt;`   signed right shift

&gt; `&gt;&gt;&gt;`  unsigned right shift

&gt; `&lt;&lt;`   left shift

&gt; In Java, the bitwise operators work with integers. JavaScript doesn't have integers. It only has double precision floating-point numbers. *So, the bitwise operators convert their number operands into integers, do their business, and then convert them back.* In most languages, these operators are very close to the hardware and very fast. *In JavaScript, they are very far from the hardware and very slow.* JavaScript is rarely used for doing bit manipulation.

&gt; As a result, in JavaScript programs, it is more likely that `&amp;` is a mistyped `&amp;&amp;` operator. The presence of the bitwise operators reduces some of the language's redundancy, making it easier for bugs to hide.

Emphasis is mine. ",1.0

e9zbn9y,9x38hu,"I'm not sure I understand - are you saying js no longer has to do the conversions from floats to ints to perform bitwise operations? My understanding is that is where the biggest performance cost comes from.

Edit: [I see now](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1523061/performance-of-bitwise-operators-in-javascript#comment66300730_11159148), the JIT allows those ints to stay as ints, so the conversion is one-time, assuming you don't need to do any kind of float arithmetic on that number after the bitwise operation.

Still, it seems the performance is still worse in js than C/C++ because you at least always have that one-time conversion (even if it's half as expensive as it was in 2008). ",1.0
e9zg5cs,9x38hu,"JITs are a bit more sophisticated than that. They generally used tagged types (of which integers are special-cased) and inline across function boundaries. Depending on the source an integer may never be realized as a floating point value, and forcing the value to a 32 bit integer can actually make some optimizations easier to apply (which is why asm.js, filled with `| 0` casts, generally runs faster even without an asm.js-specific JIT).

You will generally take speed hits in JS relative to C, but for simple operations it will generally be small.

Obviously if you're using assembly you won't have any available libraries you you'll have to reflect into the Microsoft Windows DLL registry store using a tool called ""terminal"" which exposes the native machine code of the windows kernel to allow a TCP connection to be established (remember to decrypt the base64!)

Step 2 is to use that proxy server to intercept the protocol byte stream that is established by typing ""Google.com"" into your web browser. You'll need to rewrite the handshake packets with fully signed hexadecimal hashes of Google's certificate authority, but that's pretty easy). Anyway then it's as easy as redirecting the TCP connection to your local Apache web service running on port 22, which sends back a flood of Rogue packets in order to bombard the original computer creating a BSOD. But here's the trick, when you edited the kernel earlier you changed all the BSOD error messages to ""hello world!"" And there you go! Easy, right?!

e9hk8w8,9w2j0i,"JavaScript is only weird because

* it has nearly 900 pages long specs with far fetched non-intuitive stuff like ""`{} + []` will give `'[object Object]'`"" and people will scream at your face ""it doesn't suck, it makes perfect sense when you know the specs you ignorant dumbass"";
* its compiler will do *anything* in its power to try to guess what you intended to do even when it didn't make any sense in the first place, making it roughly a hundred times harder to debug the most minor issue (especially when you have to debug a piece of code you didn't write yourself) than it would be with a good old exception;
* coercion mixed with weak typing is the devil.

Yet you'll still find people arguing it's a wonderful language because it's not even that bad when you use a... freakin' superset language that *had* to be created for the sole purpose of addressing the zillion nonsensical design choices and security flaws made when creating JS in 10 days.

I get that you can learn all the reasons behind all this weird stuff, and even that it sometimes makes sense to some extent. But I don't think people understand that when you're trying to solve actual, practical problems, you're not interested at all in struggling with the *tools* you're using to reach that goal. It's so counterproductive it's stupid. And all that story is really just a giant hype based on nothing - other than the fact JS has long been the only option for interactive web applications.

There hasn't been a single professional project that I've worked on where JS hasn't been a stupid nightmare at some point, and I'd much rather support upcoming alternatives or, if anything, code the project into some other language and then transpile it.

Looking at the structure of your code, you rely heavily on if/elif statements that are essentially copied and pasted. In programming, you generally want to follow the ‚ÄúDRY‚Äù principle - Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself. Whenever you find yourself copying and pasting code and changing only little bits, you should instead make a function or class that implements that logic. This will make debugging your programs much easier as you‚Äôll have far fewer lines written and specific logic is centralized to a specific function.  

Just my advice :) good luck on your journey!",32.0

In Python, having a superclass and deriving from it is certainly the way to go, while you'd use enums and methods on those in, for example, Rust or C(++) (which are roughly equivalent to how I'd use dictionaries there). To be honest, I don't miss OOP at all when writing in Rust, since most OOP patterns are just either (basically) slower enums or interfaces anyway; but it's nice to ""get back to the roots"" a bit, since Python was my first language, which I will always hold dearly.",2.0

print( f""{random.choice(['Nice', 'Awesome'])}! You are a {player.gender} {player.species}."" )

e93mlmp,9twajg,"**Fast inverse square root**

Fast inverse square root, sometimes referred to as Fast InvSqrt() or by the hexadecimal constant 0x5F3759DF, is an algorithm that estimates ‚Äã1‚ÅÑ‚àöx, the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the square root of a 32-bit floating-point number x in IEEE 754 floating-point format. This operation is used in digital signal processing to normalize a vector, i.e., scale it to length 1. For example, computer graphics programs use inverse square roots to compute angles of incidence and reflection for lighting and shading.  The algorithm is best known for its implementation in 1999 in the source code of Quake III Arena, a first-person shooter video game that made heavy use of 3D graphics.

e8rhsl2,9sngxl,"Draw.io is great for making diagrams and such and it's free. There are other tools like graphviz to create these programmatically but I'm not a big fan of it because it takes a lot of effort to look right.

Your comment about agile is exactly why a lot of ""agile"" companies either fail miserably or eventually abandon agile. It's not because agile is bad, but rather that their implementation is bad. A critical part of a good agile workflow is good interaction and collaboration with customers and stake holders, but in many cases those are not software engineers or programmers. They may be in marketing or accounting or management or a florist or a dentist. Regardless of who the customer or stakeholder is, or what their technical credentials are, it is critically important that they are part of the design process because they know their part and you probably don't. This is where requirements, design documentation, and diagrams are useful because it allows everyone to use as common language.

The purpose of agile isn't to get coding as quickly as possible, it's about collaborating with a customer on identifying a small set of features that are needed first (a requirements list), what the behavior should be (design documentation), then writing some code, making sure that code is correct (test plan), making sure the customer is getting what is expected, then repeating that process quickly. A lot of people get really caught up in the details of these documents and think they each have to be a reference manual, they only have to convey specific information to the involved people. Keep them short and sweet and targeted to the people who care. In many cases you could put all of needed data into a single document that is 1-3 pages long, but those 1-3 pages will save you weeks and weeks of wasted effort in the long run.

If you're working on a small project that will only be looked at by a handful of people, all who sit in the same room, you can get away without a lot of this stuff. When the project grows you will probably have to rewrite it from scratch though. Sometimes the initial speed is worth it, sometimes not.",2.0

I used to agree with this convention.

But yeah, nobody should write `if (someVariable == true)` - wtf is that?

Also, your request to kill the empty else block already takes care of this, but fuck people who don't leave an extra line between an `else` or `else if` block and the start of a new `if` block.  Whitespace suggests structure and organization, don't like to me about your structure.  Though I suppose that is similarly addressed by putting the `else`'s on the same line as the closing bracket.

SPARK is a formally defined computer programming language based on the Ada programming language, intended for the development of high integrity software used in systems where predictable and highly reliable operation is essential. It facilitates the development of applications that demand safety, security, or business integrity.

Originally, there were three versions of the SPARK language (SPARK83, SPARK95, SPARK2005) based on Ada 83, Ada 95 and Ada 2005 respectively.

A fourth version of the SPARK language, SPARK 2014, based on Ada 2012, was released on April 30, 2014.

Some code, written at the start of a project when hope is high and abstraction is higher, doesn't smell bad at all. Flowery and damp, like the second or third week of spring. It's fresh, and it speaks of things to come. But there's still a note of manure underneath. A little stink of shit, a smelly little omen.

Some code smells dusty, choking, acrid - code marked with comments like `WARNING: MAGIC` or `DO NOT REFACTOR`. Dried-up husks of what might've once been bugs lie here and there, commented out but never truly deleted, untouched for years and doomed to lie untouched for many more. 

Some code smells plasticine, industrialized - code with method names that include words like ""Factory"" and ""Generator."" There is often a slightly rotten smell near this type code, which you can trace to the accompanying documentation that has drifted badly out of date. 

Some code smells like the wet musk of hot, frothy sex. It only smells good while you're writing it - leave the room for an hour or so, and you'll find the stank unbearable when you return.

Some code smells like pineapple. Python's `lambda` statements have a strong whiff of this. Sweet and tart in a nice way for a while, but too much can be irritating.

Some code smells like Irish coffee. A fresh mug of a nice pick-me-up with a secret sauce hidden inside. This is the hardcoded magic number three thousand lines deep in some data parser just beneath the comment saying `fuck it`. ",88.0

ehnfkrh,9hr4i8,"When people complain about JS, it's usually IEEE 754",1.0
e6ehejy,9hr4i8,"NaN is the standard representation for the result of a numeric operation that does not have a defined result. For example there is no valid result for 0/0, so the options you have are basically limited to (sans some nonstandard numeric models) either a sentinel value - ‚ÄúNaN‚Äù - or an exception. IEEE 754 allows for either, and most hardware supports either behavior through control flags.

Consumer hardware in general defaults to producing a NaN rather than an exception as it makes reasoning about a program much easier as you just have to check for NaN at the end of a computation. The alternative is a lot of exception handlers liberally scattered everywhere.

In my experience the exception model is only used in specific classes of numeric applications, and even then they are generally only interested in the IEEE 754 underflow, overflow, and precision exceptions. 

As for ‚Äúthis is why I hate JS‚Äù

Take any language that allows you to specify a numeric type, say C:

    double value = 0.0;
    value /= 0;

Now value is explicitly a double, and yet if you print it the value is NaN.

Because the result of 0/0 is an undefined value - it is not a number.

An alternative way of asking this is, what should the result of

e6fd7qr,9hr4i8,"Good computer science there, but still I think the language is not complete enough to manage common math problems, many will throw ""divide by 0"" (for X/0) or ""undefined"" (for 0/0) as exception instead of NaN.

As a programmer I design tons equations but I am no math expert so in a math-related bug I don't know what I did wrong, in Javascript the programs throws NaN or something unrelated at the end because the NaN/null/wrong value was passed from one variable to another BUT in other languages it throws the exception and we know EXACTLY where the problem is and fix it immediately.

I am talking entirely from experience point, indeed I've worked with frameworks that throws the exceptions but they are wrong because the FW is just trying to interpret what JS is doing.

e6gfgrv,9hr4i8,"I'm not sure what the other languages you're referring to are. It's important to note that there is a different between floating point divide and integer divide, in that floating point has redundant space that can be used to (among other things) represent an undefined value.

Integer division does not have the ability to have such sentinels so more or less all modern processors throw an exception, because there's no way to distinguish an undefined result sentinel (say 0/0 =&gt; 0 which i /think/ some hardware did in the 80s) from a regular result (0/1 =&gt; 0).

As far as languages that do default to throwing an exception, the only immediately obvious one to me would be Ada, but that's prolific in exception throwing and most people seem to complain about it. Other possibilities would be Haskell, and maybe Pascal.

C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, Rust, Swift, ... all produce NaN values rather than faulting.

But when the hardware defaults to silent exceptions (the case on ARM and Intel) it's difficult for even the OS to ensure that exceptions will always be thrown (in x87 for instance, saving the fpu state also reinitializes the FPU to its default state), and also doesn't interact with the majority of the libraries you'd interact with (because they're all assuming default behaviour).

For C programs (or any other language that doesn't have first class support for exceptions) you have to use signal handlers, and implement stack unwinding manually yourself. I'm not sure if C++ exceptions will allow you to catch FP exceptions, I assume they can but i've never seen it done.

For a GPU the cost of producing an exception is even more dire, as they are designed to as much as possible straight line everything without any ability to interrupt execution (you can trivially take out a GPU simply by giving it a shader that takes a huge amount of time to execute. Generally the OS has watchdogs that will literally do a hardware reset of the GPU if it does not complete in time.

But anyway, exceptions are perfectly valid way of handling floating point undefined values, but for general programming the cost of arbitrary potential side effects during exception handling, make writing programs, and libraries that other programs may depend, on much more challenging to be correct, and to be *safe*. That's why all modern systems (last ooh, 30 years?) default to silently producing NaN values. It also *generally* works better for real programs, even if during development it can be frustrating to find a computation that went wrong.",2.0

3. php loads the newest image, using IM crops only a small rectangle centered on the car but wide enough to see the ball indicator arrow when ballcam is off. Car is erased with a big white circle drawn in the middle. 
4. Imagick - convert the image to a bitmap array, split image into 3 columns. look at each column for pixels whose r \~= g \~= b \~= 150 (the color of the ball indicator).  
5. If more indicator-colored pixels are on the left, write a file with the contents 'left', same for 'right'.   'none' is used if there are too many matching pixels or if there are a similar number of matching pixels between left and right. 
6. Autohotkey script loops endlessly (ideally) re-reading that file, pressing the A key when the file reads 'left' and the D key when it reads 'right'.  W is always pressed no matter what the file reads.

no, container.stop would receive the Promise that `.catch()` returns. `container.stop` may or may not be handling promises instead of callbacks.

e64mplv,9gcxd7,"&gt; no, container.stop would receive the Promise that .catch() returns. 

I'm pretty sure that's what I **just** said

Assuming that `container` looks something like this:

    class Container{
      stop(cb) {
        cb();
        console.log(""Container stopped"");
      }
      remove(){
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
            reject();

        });
      }
      kill(){
        console.log('Container killed');
      }
    }

Then, we can use it like this:

    const container = new Container();

    container.stop(() =&gt; container.remove().catch(container.kill));

Which produces this output:

1. Remove rejected
1. Container stopped
1. Container killed

---


However, if we remove those parentheses and use it like this:

    container.stop(container.remove().catch(container.kill));


What we get is this:

1. Remove rejected
1. `Uncaught TypeError: cb is not a function`
1. Container killed

Your comment I replied to didn't even include the word 'Promise' so you couldn't have said exactly that.

In your mock, kill() doesn't reference `this`, so it's going to work, but in a real life scenario, it would most likely use `this` with the assumption that it points to the container object in question, so that last line would not work. See: https://jsfiddle.net/zu6vp9yj/",1.0

If you actually want help, you should probably go to a different subreddit. This one is kind of a joke subreddit about really, really bad code.

But I would do it on /r/learnprogramming or something, this isn't the right place.

Precalculating is your friend.

int lcm(int a, int b) {

    int lcm(int a, int b) {

Now you need to calculate greatest common divisor, should be pretty easy:  
  
lcm(a,b) = (a*b) / gcd(a,b)         ...  *gcd(a,b)  

gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b           ...   /lcm(a,b)  

gcd(a,b) = (a*b) / lcm(a,b)  
  
Lets write the function:  
  
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return a*b/lcm(a,b);
    }

Newbie CS student who has their homework/simple projects up on github and stars interesting projects. These I like because I wish GH had existed back in the day for me to do the same. Instead, I've lost a lot of my work over the years, even if it was crap I somewhat would like to have it again.

People well-versed in the industry starring occasional projects they came across.

The best code I work with has at most one or two comments per function, and a *function header* telling me what the fuck it's supposed to do.

It's better to write clearer code and only comment the gotchas.

The worst code I've ever worked with was written by one of my interns, who believed you could always benefit from more comments. She would name her variables as `numberOfLordsLeaping` and would then comment next to it `// represents the number of leaping lords`. Nothing I did could stop her from doing this for nearly EVERY line of code.

Worse yet was stuff like this:

```go
counter := 0      // counter is an integer
for {             // infinite loop start
  doTheNeedful()  // call the doTheNeedful function, which combobulates the discombobulator
  counter += 1    // Increment counter

System 7 (codenamed ""Big Bang"" and sometimes retrospectively called Mac OS 7) is a graphical user interface-based operating system for Macintosh computers and is part of the classic Mac OS series of operating systems. It was introduced on May 13, 1991, by Apple Computer, Inc. It succeeded System 6, and was the main Macintosh operating system until it was succeeded by Mac OS 8 in 1997. Features added with the System 7 release included virtual memory, personal file sharing, QuickTime, QuickDraw 3D, and an improved user interface.

Integer division can be a nasty surprise sometimes, the above 6/5 won't yield 1.2, like a calculator would, or you might with pen/paper. It does long division with remainders. The answer is quotient=1,remainder=1, and divisions always yield the quotient unless you explicitly ask for the remainder with %, or mod.

So the x/5*x will get the the largest multiple of 5 still smaller than or equal to the size of x, so 19 would get you 15, etc.

x/5 with x being an integer is equivalent to floor(x/5)

Now, had strikerows been a float or double, or had the equation been (X/5.0)*5, then I would agree with you, pointless math.",9.0

e01ohow,8o50fy,"Java has actually 3 stages(and the JIT part its done between them), which ends up in 2 compiled versions (that can be cached in some JVMs!)
1- Interpreter mode while analysing what the program does(same as python but more optimized during the compilation to bytecode).  
2- Basic compilation for not so hot methods(Almost the same that would be run with minimal optimizations and still tracking everything the method does).  
3- Full optimized compilation thats blazing fast but takes time to do, not much code needs to reach this stage.

e01ge1d,8o50fy,"Python takes substantially more CPU than languages like C, Java, and Golang for computationally intensive tasks, but while it's waiting for a network response or disk I/O the any of those languages are going to have idling CPUs. Until application level CPU is your bottleneck it doesn't make a huge difference whether you're using the most efficient language or the least.

Having performance tuned web applications in Python, Java, and Golang, the things you usually run into are:

* Database query efficiency 
* Database connection counts 
* Application server connection counts
* File descriptor limits 
* Caching or otherwise streamlining common lookups / calculations 
* Memory tuning (having enough RAM, avoiding memory leaks, avoiding certain inefficiencies in garbage collection).

In almost every web application I've ever tuned, unless someone was doing something really dumb that was easily fixed at the application layer, *all* of those things became problems earlier than CPU utilization. If those are the points that force you to scale your application, you're not paying 1000x as much on the bill.

Now sure, if you're writing a video game, doing ETL processes, doing heavy data analytics - those tend to be CPU bound, and you probably shouldn't use Python (at least without C extensions for the computationally intensive stuff). But if your application is bound by network latency and your CPU is mostly idle, that extra little bit your CPU is going to spend on the code that connects your Http requests to your database requests is going to be inconsequential.

dzzcddr,8nsxi6,"Lets start from the beginning.  A post has a score, I'm going to refer to it as `s`.

When you vote, you read the value `s` has, add/subtract one depending on the vote, and save the new value to `s`.

    upvote:   s = s + 1
    downvote: s = s - 1

So now what if we use -1 instead of 1?

    upvote:   s = s + -1  -&gt;  s = s - 1
    downvote: s = s - -1  -&gt;  s = s + 1

They've swapped, the addition is actually subtracting 1, and vice versa.

Now, in many languages, when you have `s = s +`, you can shorten it a little and write `s+=` instead, which says almost the same thing, take everything on the right of the `=`, add the value of the label(`s`) on the left to it, and then save the result under the label(`s`) on the left side.

So now, if we do not expand the operators, just apply the short form of the operator instead, we have:

    upvote:   s = s + -1  -&gt;  s += -1
    downvote: s = s + -1  -&gt;  s -= -1

But recall that the effect has flipped, so my labeling is wrong, to fix that now:

    upvote:   s -= -1
    downvote: s += -1

Now kill the unecessary spaces, and throw out the variable name and we have:

    upvote:   -=-1
    downvote: +=-1

I watched part of a talk by Rasmus Lerdorf about PHP 7. He specifically said that their challenge was to build an improved runtime for the language without breaking any of the millions of lines of PHP out there. Speed is not the biggest problem of PHP, although it certainly is one. PHP will never be good without being redesigned, which would effectively make it a new language and create a Python 2 vs. 3 situation.

Also, please give me a reason why I should use PHP over Dart, for instance? I can write server-side and client-side code in one language and get type safety, real error reporting, consistency, and an efficient runtime.

* It's everywhere, I can copy my code into the webroot of almost any server and it'll just work.

* Because it's everywhere, there are a lot of high-quality libraries for doing advanced things very easily.  IIRC you can generate and send to the client's browser a simple .ods spreadsheet in around four lines of code.

* Because it's everywhere, any question I have already has a solution or three available on StackOverflow.",1.0
dzygj9s,8n8wma,"I can appreciate that. It's brought up in one of Slack's developer's [justification for their use of PHP](https://slack.engineering/taking-php-seriously-cf7a60065329). I'm not sure I subscribe to the idea that a second or two of delay between save and reload is that significant, though. Good build systems support incremental changes, too. I think the benefit of a really quick feedback loop is felt much more in front-end development where one can easily implement hot reloading per module.

    const fs = require('fs');
    const flatData = fs.readFileSync('flat-file.txt');

Is that so bad? Were Node's library not split into modules, it would be no more verbose than in PHP. Node's option is better namespaced, offers an async version, and accepts an optional object containing parameters for the operation (such as what encoding to use). PHP's equivalent accepts four optional parameters, some of which are nullable in order that later parameters can be used without them. An options hashmap or ""array"" would be much better suited. I'd also consider the fact that the lack of needing an import in PHP is a side effect of its lack of proper scoping; so much exists globally in one namespace ‚Äì it's ridiculous.

Eh, not any server. I wholeheartedly agree that most shared hosting will have PHP set up, but often poorly. You have no proper control over your PHP configuration (because apparently a language should have such a thing), and must instead rely on `ini_set()`. Your version will also not likely be upgraded often, leaving you vulnerable. When you do control the hosting, you still need to set it up like any other language, although I agree that starting a new project doesn't require work getting a structure and build system set up. Part of the reason it'll *just work* is also the fact that PHP avoids throwing errors whenever possible, and just chuggs on doing, potentially, the wrong thing. It's also really not ideal for the source code of your application to reside in the document root. You must rely on the webserver to not only process PHP before sending out a result, but also to honour your rewrite rules and not allow loading of includes and other non-endpoint files. WordPress' `&lt;?php defined ('ABSPATH') or die(...` and `// Silence is golden` are just horrible and asking for trouble.

There are niche libraries in every language. I could use a golf language and write a kernel in 2 KB of source, but it's not worth it to me. The PHP ecosystem contains heaps of projects that unashamedly attempt to make PHP less shit, and there are a heap more shit examples of PHP out there. The community may be big, but how much of it is WordPress? That falls firmly in the shit camp if you ask me.

Again, the size of a community isn't always better bigger. There are a lot of blog posts and Stack Overflow answers that are just awful, and don't promote good use of PHP, if there is such a thing.

I can see your points, and I could see the value of a language that fits into the server stack like PHP does, but that is responsibly designed. There are already several languages that compile to PHP, much like CoffeeScript does to JavaScript. They offer an alternative, while potentially also retaining interoperability with PHP software. The real problem is that PHP is not suited to projects of scale. It's worth the time to set up a build and runtime environment for a general-purpose language if the project is going to be big, or even just reasonably sized. The more specific your application is to a particular need, the more likely it is you'll write your own code anyway to avoid wrestling other libraries into doing what you need them to.

I'll stick to avoiding it myself.",2.0

For anyone wondering why this is amateurish, there are two issues here.

First, an if statement with a return has no need for an else clause. You could just do:

    def f(x):
        if x &gt;= 0:
            return True
        
        return False

And second, since this is just returning a Boolean, there is no need for the if statement at all, the entire function could just be:

    def f(x):
        return x &gt;= 0


Depending on the use case, like if this was just something you needed on a one off occasion to pass your function as a parameter, you might get bonus points by using a lambda:


    f = lambda x: x &gt;= 0

But reasonable people can disagree about whether that‚Äôs good style.

dyl2okt,8hjt28,It's also less likely to cause bugs later on if the return statement is moved for any reason and you forget to add an else.,11.0

    if (x == null) {
        return null;
    } else {
        return x;
    }

Then the final return isn't related to the condition. You *could* have a secondary check in the
middle. So I'd write that as 

    if (x == null) {
        return null;
    }

    return x;

But if it's something like

    if (invert) {
        return x;
    } else {
        return -x;
    }

Then you'd have to change both lines if you wanted to change one of them, logically. So I'd keep
that together.

variable at the end.

He's one of those people who put his nested closing braces all on the same line lisp style. 

For me personally, I find lisp-style blocks like that much harder to read. While theoretically the closing brace position contains 0 information, the symmetry created by giving each brace its own line and indentation makes code a lot easier on the eyes.

For something like this, I'm not sure. I could go either way. I can read 

    return x&gt;=0

RAS syndrome (where ""RAS"" stands for ""redundant acronym syndrome"", making the phrase ""RAS syndrome"" humorously self-referential) refers to the use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym or other initialism in conjunction with the abbreviated form, thus in effect repeating one or more words.

Two common examples are ""PIN (or VIN) number"" (the ""N"" in PIN and VIN stands for ""number"") and ""ATM machine"" (the ""M"" in ATM stands for ""machine""). The term RAS syndrome was coined in 2001 by New Scientist.

A person is humorously said to suffer from RAS syndrome when they redundantly use one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself.

dzlp5ol,8gzr12,"Seriously, there already exists a _""better CSV format""_, which supports relational data, among other things. It's kind of like YAML, with much less syntax though. It's a name/value/children format, separating the name of the node and its value with a "":"", and opening up a children collection with a carriage return and two consecutive spaces. E.g.

    name:value
      children-name:children-value
    another-name:another-value

The above contains two _""nodes""_, where the first node has one child node, allowing you to declare graph objects. Since the format supports C# strings, it automatically also supports carriage return and UNICODE characters, etc. Below is an example of a value with a CR/LF in it.

    name:""foo\r\nbar""

The above is a syntax I created myself some few years ago, and is the file format for declaring _""lambda objects""_. I refer to it as _""Hyperlambda""_.

Even if you completely ignore my other work (Phosphorus Five), if you're looking for a superior way to store data, Hyperlambda has some pretty cool traits, such as being **dead simple to read** among other things ...

And it's dead simple to implement parses for, since it's only got two distinct _""tokens""_, being "":"" and SP+SP ...

The biggest job is arguably to implement parsers allowing you to parse C# strings, however this is easily done with some 20-30 lines of code in fact ...

And no, you can't use JSON, since JSON is a **key**/value format, implying you can't repeat the same _""key""_ twice in the same scope. Hyperlambda allows you to do this, since it's a **name**/value/children format ...",1.0

umm... it's a generator of random *characters*, not numbers. Read the title. Ofc it can only return 256 possible values (one char a time), but you could use it to build strings of lengths limited only by available memory.

&gt; Unless you free it

freeing has absolutely nothing to do with this.... The code derives the random character by *dereferencing* the first byte of malloc'ed memory, not from the pointer itself. This *would* indeed return random characters until you run out of memory. Too bad the actual output will be 99.999% zeroes, because all non-reused memory will be allocated from the OS, which usually zeroes it out.

It could actually return more nonzero ""random"" values by taking some bits of the returned pointer instead of dereferencing it, but whatever :)",3.0

A correct solution to any of the problems results in a US $1 million prize being awarded by the institute to the discoverer(s).

At present, the only Millennium Prize problem to have been solved is the Poincar√© conjecture, which was solved by the Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman in 2003.

It also features PGP cryptography services and functionality, synchronous AES256 bits encryption, automatically also included on ZIP files as an option - And I can create PGP key pairs as strong as 16,000 bits, which are cryptographically secured stored in Gnu Privacy Guard format.

It allows me to create passwords in UTF8, increasing the entropy from 128 per character, to roughly a million per character, supporting passwords with Chinese characters, or Ô£ø for that matter. Arguably, a two character long password in Phosphorus Five, has a higher amount of entropy than your average 8-10 character long password.

During installation on a Linux server, it shuts down everything except port 80, 443 and 22 (SSH), and tightens Apache to the point where you couldn't slice in a human hair if you tried.

I have spread it all over Social Media under the title of _""World Heavy Weight Programming Language Championship contest is GOING DOWN!""_ - I'll try to get Guinness World Book of Records to participate as a neutral observer. I assume we will be given the same specification, and asked to solve the problem, any ways we see fit.

I have invited Microsoft, MSDN, Channel9, DZone, and several other _""heavy weights""_ from our industry to help promote and air the event.

I will be using exclusively Hyperlambda (if possible), and resort only to C# Active Events where I have to. OP can use any programming language, library, or framework he wants to - Including his own programming language called _""Lily""_, which you can read about here - https://github.com/FascinatedBox/lily

Lily has 2622 commits to its Git repo, Phosphorus Five and hence Hyperlambda has 2901 commits, so both languages should be equally mature.

Lily is an OOP language and Hyperlambda is (some would argue) a Functional Programming Language - Although technically this is not correct. So I guess it also would solve the dispute of _""OOP versus FP""_. As I have understood, the event will be streamed live, and any profits will go to charity. However, I am not acquainted with the organisers myself in any ways, and I know nothing about the event besides the screenshot in the above link. In addition, it provides the OP to put weight behind his statements about Hyperlambda, if he should win.

I think I have taken this as a sport, and I wish _""FascinatedBox""_ good luck.

OP (_obviously!_) spoke without knowing what he was talking about. My credibility has long since flown out the window, and to be honest with you, I couldn't care less! **However**, my _work_, is something I take _very seriously_! And when some (I assume) 25 year old punk assumes it's _""rubbish""_, obviously without knowing anything about it, I do take it _very personally_.

And in fact, I never knew about this sub-reddit, before I was at-replied, arguably in a _""bullying way""_.

If OP has data that suggests that what he says is true, I welcome him to prove it. However, his headline as it stands now, will be shuffled down his throat, roughly one month from now.

Having worked as a software developer for 20+ years now professionally, and before that 12 years as a hobbyist, I think I am qualified to put forth the following statement; _""It would arguably be able to replace somewhere between 50-80 percent of all web apps built over the last decade or so""_. At the very least when I provide support for _""linked tables""_ (foreign keys).

Henry Ford once said; _""If I were to give people what they wanted, I would have bred faster horses""_. I am sorry if I sound cocky, but I to a large extent feel that the above quote could just as easily have been applied to Phosphorus Five, Hyperlambda and me!

Among other things, I have created a webmail client, that is 2 orders of magnitudes smaller on bandwidth consumption than GMail ==&gt; more than 100 times smaller!

Maybe I am an asshole, to be quite frank with you, I don't care what I am, or what people's perception of me is. However, my work is **not** rubbish! And I challenge anyone who claims that it is to _prove it_!

So we need to cast to int.  But simply casting to an int will actually translate the bits from a float to an int.  We don't want that.  We want to preserve the bits of the float and just view it as an int.  So we take the address of the variable and cast to a `char*` which is always legal.  Then we cast to an `int*` which is undefined behavior, but does what we want on the platform I'm writing on, your mileage may vary.  Then we dereference it, and now we have the int version of this float.

An example:

5.3f =&gt; 1084856730

Haha, I just realized I never smuggled it back through pointers to make it a float again.  Oh well, it's shitty either way.  Here's the ""corrected"" version.  It actually functions.

    int main () {
      float num = 5.3f;
      unsigned omgwtf = (*((unsigned *)((char *)(&amp;num)))) ^ (1 &lt;&lt; 31);
      num = *(float *)(char *)(&amp;omgwtf);
      std::cout &lt;&lt; num &lt;&lt; std::endl;

Rumor is, if you flag something for investigation for CP, they have to thoroughly investigate it, i.e. watch a 10 hour loop of a Rick roll video, etc.

The super huge space generated by the 1280x800 space (and then the complexity of RGB etc) makes this much too large for a computer to process, and even more difficult to store on a drive (waaaay too big) but you could write a FUSE plugin that mounts a program on your computer as a folder, which automatically generates pixels as you descend into the folder, meaning you only have to store one permutation at a time, and to the user it's transparent, i.e. it looks as if the file has always been there....

drdrttn,7k8wti,"**Kolmogorov complexity**

In algorithmic information theory (a subfield of computer science and mathematics), the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of the shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output. It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as descriptive complexity, Kolmogorov‚ÄìChaitin complexity, algorithmic entropy, or program-size complexity. It is named after Andrey Kolmogorov, who first published on the subject in 1963.

The notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to Cantor's diagonal argument, G√∂del's incompleteness theorem, and Turing's halting problem.

",5.0
dqjkflo,7gf9jp,Can someone ELI5? ,2.0
dqjlh9f,7gf9jp,"Sure! [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) is a programming language that makes it really easy to write short programs that process streams of columnar text. The language is structured as a set of conditions (e.g., `$0 == ""fish""`) and procedures (`print &gt;&gt; ""basket"";`), where a procedure is run if and only if its condition is met. In the general case, awk reads input one line at a time, splits it by column, and then evaluates conditions and procedures. Data from the line is available in variables `$0` through `$NF` where `$0` is the entire line, `$1` is the first field, and `$NF` (NF = number of fields) is the last field. For example:

    $ cat foo
    alice bob carol
    foo bar quux
    $ awk '$2 == ""bob"" { print $1, $3; }' &lt; foo
    alice carol

The awk program `$2 == ""bob"" { print $1, $3; }` reads input line-by-line, and for any lines where the second column contains ""bob"", prints the first and third columns.

The fish program uses another feature where `print` output can be redirected to another file, instead of standard output. So the program reads input line-by-line, and prints all ""fish"" lines to a file named ""basket"", and all non-fish lines to ""downstream"".

`mkfifo` creates a special type of file that doesn't store data on disk, but can stream data through it. So the joke is that I'm trying to use my laptop to take input from upstream (as in where the water in the stream comes from), and sort it into fish (which I want in my basket) and non-fish (which can keep on going downstream).

What you probably know (but ELI5, so I might as well make it obvious), is that when you put a typical consumer laptop in a stream of running water, the laptop stops working from water damage. I don't recommend trying this at home. (But seriously, who has a stream in their home?!)

1. Create and call a specific webmethod which generates a token for a given user and its password. This token has a short lifetime (minutes or hours) and is returned to ""client"".
1. Your ""client"" calls all your webmethods with the generated token (no more with user and password).

So you need to actually define unlikely as 10%. Be sure to put ""private int percent"" before it so the interpreter knows what to do:

`#define private integer Unlikely(% int 10)`

So likely is equal to 10 percent too. Because you've already defined an percentage before, you need to make this one public:

`#define private public Int Likely(% int 10)`

dqhxs4z,7cumss,"
You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The &lt;center&gt; cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes.

In computability theory, the Ackermann function, named after Wilhelm Ackermann, is one of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.

After Ackermann's publication of his function (which had three nonnegative integer arguments), many authors modified it to suit various purposes, so that today ""the Ackermann function"" may refer to any of numerous variants of the original function. One common version, the two-argument Ackermann‚ÄìP√©ter function, is defined as follows for nonnegative integers m and n:

In linguistics, morphological leveling or paradigm leveling is the generalization of an inflection across a paradigm or between words. For example, the extension by analogy of the (more frequent) third-person singular form is to other persons, such as I is and they is, observed in some dialects of English such as African American Vernacular English, is an example of leveling, as is the reanalysis of English strong verbs as weak verbs, such as bode becoming bided, swoll becoming swelled, and awoke becoming awakened. The original strong forms of these and most other leveled verbs are readily understood by modern English speakers, but are seldom used. Another example is how for all but a few nouns the original English plural suffixes stemming from the Old English weak declension have been replaced by one general plural marker; as late as the 16th century, shoon was still in use as the plural form of shoe, but in contemporary English the only acceptable form is shoes, using the general plural marker -s.

Xenix is a discontinued version of the Unix operating system for various microcomputer platforms, licensed by Microsoft from AT&amp;T Corporation in the late 1970s. The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) later acquired exclusive rights to the software, and eventually replaced it with SCO UNIX (now known as SCO OpenServer).

In the mid-to-late 1980s, Xenix was the most common Unix variant, measured according to the number of machines on which it was installed. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said in 1996 that for a long time that company had the highest-volume AT&amp;T Unix license.

In some distros, it's what /u/Krakob said - L:\dev\null.  In older distros, /u/nderflow is correct - this was something that systemd changed.

In Mac OS X, the files are placed into small bundles and then shipped towards China, then the bytes are dumped overboard in the ocean - there's currently a lot of debate about how ecologically friendly this is, but Apple has refused to comment.

However, languages are a different story.  Ruby will simply refuse to acknowledge any references to the file and pretend it's not there, but if the file was loaded into memory, it stays there - this explains why Ruby tends to be such a memory hog.

Java, to ensure cross-platform compatibility, will rename the file randomly and move it somewhere on the filesystem.

Javascript will try to minify the file and/or compress it into meaninglessness.

Why? Because there was a fixed size array of players. The solution was to make the array size 256. All the client instances were pre allocated, even when not in use.

Every time the client needed to verify which users were online, it looped the pre allocated instances checking for a ""online"" property being true. This was done every time it was needed to send a message for each connected client. 

Other lists were similarly implemented.

Another interesting thing that comes to mind was the monster IA, which was just a single class with a giant thousand lines of code switch statement.

In computing, a hardware random number generator (true random number generator, TRNG) is a device that generates random numbers from a physical process, rather than a computer program. Such devices are often based on microscopic phenomena that generate low-level, statistically random ""noise"" signals, such as thermal noise, the photoelectric effect, involving a beam splitter, and other quantum phenomena. These stochastic processes are, in theory, completely unpredictable, and the theory's assertions of unpredictability are subject to experimental test. A hardware random number generator typically consists of a transducer to convert some aspect of the physical phenomena to an electrical signal, an amplifier and other electronic circuitry to increase the amplitude of the random fluctuations to a measurable level, and some type of analog to digital converter to convert the output into a digital number, often a simple binary digit 0 or 1.

dn7izb3,7106c4,"So for an actual explanation...

Likely there is an overflow issue here. When the guy asks for a number up to 1 million, that's too high so Alexa rounds it down to the maximum it can store, which is for some reason 545,387 (the fact that it is prime may or may not be relevant). My guess is that the random number generated happened to be greater than 545,387 so it got rounded down to the same value.

If I had to guess I would say this only happens about 50% of the time, with the other 50% having the random number land somewhere within the valid range.

[edit]
Downvoted for being right..not sure if because I'm in /r/shittyprogramming or because people really think ""a million is nothing to a computer"" somehow invalidates my answer. Numbers are stored in variables. Variables have types. Some types hold less than a million (the max value of 'short' for example is 32767). I don't know if my explanation is the correct one, but it's very plausible and overflows like this still happen all the time even in the modern era with our super powerful computers.

I can also program in NASM assembly, so I do understand enough about optimization, limited storage, and overflow issues (that can arise from bad programming). But this is either programmed in JavaScript (node.js) or Java from what I can tell. These memory issues wouldn't be a problem in JavaScript as the variables types can hold a number up to something like 9 quadrillion.

I'm guessing, since it's an internal app by Amazon, that it's likely in Java. The 'int' variable in Java can hold somewhere around 2 billion. The 'long' variable can hold 2^63 (that's a big number).

In reality it's probably something someone whipped up real quick. Then they expected it to work because of it's simplicity, but a simple error handling problem 'broke' it. This is an assignment most professors give out in college nowadays, and that's probably where the idea originated from. IMO it's a pretty boring game/feature, but hey upper management said ""it's got to be cool like Siri.""",1.0

In computer engineering, Halt and Catch Fire, known by the assembly mnemonic HCF, is an idiom referring to a computer machine code instruction that causes the computer's central processing unit (CPU) to cease meaningful operation, typically requiring a restart of the computer. It originally referred to a fictitious instruction in IBM System/360 computers, but later computer developers who saw the joke created real versions of this instruction for some machines. In the case of real instructions the implication of this expression is that, whereas in most cases in which a CPU executes an unintended instruction (a bug in the code) the computer may still be able to recover, but in the case of an HCF instruction there is, by definition, no way for the system to recover without a restart.

The expression ""catch fire"" in this context is normally facetious, rather than literal, referring to a total loss of CPU functionality during the current session.

User-Agent-Supports: &lt;a very long list of features with formalised names&gt;

If you have the ability to do a round trip to have the server tell you what features *it* knows about, then you could use feature groups to be able to send ""chrome59"". That's not *lying* about your features, it's using shorthand that the server can then expand into a list of features (Where there's monthly or something releases of a list). If 2 browsers or releases mapped to the same set of features, then only one of them would be included in the map, and you'd just send that.

If an up to date client tries to connect to a server where the list (Maybe identified by SHA256 or a UUID to discourage servers just sending the current date) is too out of date (As in, the server doesn't know about what the client was about to send), it would do the expansion itself so the server doesn't have to.

It does include *another* round trip, but SSL already has a fair few of those to my knowledge, so you might be able to send it as part of that, since it's static information that isn't really sensitive, the worst changing it's going to do is confuse the client into either expanding it when it didn't need to (And wasting some bandwidth), or *not* expanding it and confusing the server into seeing a browser it doesn't know about, where it would just fall back to the user-agent.",1.0

&gt; *** stack smashing detected ***: &lt;unknown&gt; terminated

I'm not entirely sure *how* you'd get arbitrary code execution from this though. You can't
overwrite something to point to system() or something, and you don't have a lot of space to write
to anyway. You also only have *one* printf, it's not in a loop, so I think you are unable to write
values that ever decrease, since %n can only write the amount of bytes written so far.

That, and you're only allowed 16 bytes of space in buf before things crash, at least on my machine.

I can get up to

    Invalid write of size 4
       at 0x4E8572B: printf_positional (in /usr/lib/libc-2.26.so)
       by 0x4E877F1: vfprintf (in /usr/lib/libc-2.26.so)
       by 0x4E8EAA5: printf (in /usr/lib/libc-2.26.so)
       by 0x1087CF: main (test3.c:10)
     Address 0x2020202020000000 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd

using `clang test3.c -g -fno-stack-protector &amp;&amp; echo '        %9$n' | setarch x86_64 -R valgrind ./a.out`
So I can write to (semi) arbitrary values in memory, but all the fun parts are a lot lower in
memory, and since this is big endian, I can't make an address start with (or even contain except for the
end) a null byte.

Maybe I'll have a look at WU-FTPD and see if I can make an exploit from that without looking at the
actual exploit notes. I know it's printf(user-provided-data) related, but that's about it.

1. You can easily compress and optimsize 50 files in a zip folder which will take maximum 40-50 seconds.

2.You dont need plug ins though the truth is plug in automates the process but at the same time it rises up the extra load on your webisite.Hence you can easily avoid this hassle.

3.The maximum lossless reduction of the image is by 70-80% which i think is enough for any purpose.

4.You can compress a jpg/png/gif or a ppy too.

5.You can manage colors here and there using the existing colors of the picture but this is done without making any noticeable or visible changes in anyones eye.

This is similar to how you may be able to out perform a c++ compiler writing in machine code technically, but it's a daunting task and compilers have gotten so good no sane person would even attempt it.

3. The whole system relies on throwing the salt into the password hash and outputs a 96 character hash (64 for the AES + 32 for the MD5 salt).

4. You don't even have to bother trying to crack the AES encryption if you know the hashing method and the salt. The salt is provided in the hash and the hashing method is well known and has been implemented in Hashcat.

Simply hard-code the output string for a single starting condition. Demonstrate this to your colleagues, the string will come out as fast as your console can display it and any code benchmarking will show that it is really really fast.  
  
You'll immediately come across the problem of generating the hard-coded output string. You can get around this easily by doing a 'test run' where you sit around in a circle and play fizz-buzz with your colleagues. The audio can be recorded and a text-to-speech application can then generate the plain-text.  
  
A slightly different approach is to change the game slightly. The slow down is because of the silly game rules - divisible by 3 or 5 can simply be modified to be divisible by 2 or 4 (simply by decrementing the rule condition by 1). Use of any hardware multiplier or fancy floating-point arithmetic is now no longer required - you simply check to see if the number can be bitshifted right by 1 place (divisible by 2) or shifted right by 2 places (divisible by 4). The code is:  
  
if(value&gt;&gt;1) { return(""Fizz""); }  
if(value&gt;&gt;2) { return(""Buzz""); }  
  
Hope this helps  
  
edit: quick update on decrementing the rule condition. If using C, it's easy as follows:

dkbabyj,6n3xft,"The Herald has a new alert:

They will be here in 3 days, 14 minutes, 43 seconds, 439 microseconds. Estimates match ORACLE prediction.

Orbital imaging show 3 large ranks. Remote Automated Agents have gathered samples. They have evolved a new toxin.

This toxin was applied to a hollow via injection to the left bicep. Within 5 minutes, visible necrosis occurred around the injection site. Within 10 minutes, necrosis was visible on a large percent of the subject's skin, and the left bicep had decayed to such a degree that bone was visible. Within 12 minutes, all skin had suffered necrosis, revealing decaying muscles as the remaining skin patches slid off. Within 15 minutes, all major organs suffered substantial necrosis, and vital signs ceased. Subject was left for 1 hour following death. It was observed that bone structure was severely compromised, causing them to take on powdered nature.

They have also evolved an optimized wing structure. Samples showed intricate nano-structures which allow up to 3.45 times greater air speed, as well as up to 2.3 times longer flight time. This results in a current land speed of approximately 280 km/s and a current flight time of approximately 4, 24 hour days.

The Designer will now be consulted for further automated strategic response. Thank you for accessing ORACLE.

SIMD within a register (SWAR) is a technique for performing parallel operations on data contained in a processor register. SIMD stands for single instruction, multiple data.

Many modern general-purpose computer processors have some provisions for SIMD, in the form of a group of registers and instructions to make use of them. SWAR refers to the use of those registers and instructions, as opposed to using specialized processing engines designed to be better at SIMD operations.

diml503,6g0bss,"Well there's probably some sort of black magic involving reflection and `ctypes` that will allow you to tunnel into the bowels of the interpreter at runtime and change None to point at a different object, if you're into that.",12.0
dinqhwh,6g0bss,"I gave this a shot but couldn't manage to `ctypes.cast` `None` to anything other than a `c_void_p` without a segfault. 

I still believe it's probably possible, but definitely requires some deep magic.",6.0
dio1woh,6g0bss,"You can make other objects into `None`, but I'm not sure of another object that's as small in memory as `None` (16 bytes) that you could copy into `None`. Interestingly, since integers are cached and slightly larger (28 bytes), you can copy `None` into an integer.

    from ctypes import memmove
    from sys import getsizeof
    
    memmove(id(23), id(None), getsizeof(None))
    print(23)
    #None
    
    print(24-1)
    #None
    
    print(23 is None)
    #False

The other problem is that `is` is a comparison on `id()`, and in CPython, `id()` is implemented as the address in memory of the object. Even if you copy some other object into `None`, they're still going to be different addresses, so `is` will still fail.

By the way, screwing around with python internals with ctypes like this is a real quick way to a segfault if you're not careful, as should go without mentioning.

Also, all the testing I did was in Python 3.6.0.",3.0
dio8a0d,6g0bss,"It seems like the built-in `Ellipsis` is also 16 large (which makes sense as it's another singleton constant). I was able to successfully copy `Ellipsis` into `None` like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; from ctypes import *
    &gt;&gt;&gt; memmove(id(None), id(Ellipsis), 16)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; None
    &gt;&gt;&gt; repr(None)
    'Ellipsis'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Ellipsis is None
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Ellipsis == None
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(None)
    &lt;class 'ellipsis'&gt;

The equality checks fail because the data are at different locations. The `__eq__` method of both types is inherited from `object`, which defaults to `is` and so the `==` check is false too (confirming your statements above).

I also tried to screw around with `__slots__` to create custom 16 size objects:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; class Whatever:
        __slots__ = []
        def __repr__(self):
            return ""Whatever""
    &gt;&gt;&gt; w = Whatever()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; getsizeof(w)
    16

However, the `memmove` creates a segfault all the time. No idea why `Ellipsis` works and this doesn't. It could be some low level details on how the singletons are implemented in the interpreter, as `Ellipsis` does have its own special syntax `...` on that level. Either way it looks my original statement is probably impossible.",5.0

I personally like Redshift for most of my data storage. One of our services uses dynamoDB since we are storing terabytes of data with low read/writes. My team have had no issues with storing a crap ton of JSON logs in mongoDB. We chose that over dynamo or a relational database since dynamo you need to pay a lot for heavy reads, and the data model fit Mongo perfectly and was quick to set up. 

The point is, use the right tool for the problem at hand. Something that can be MongoDB. ",-9.0

dikzk99,6fprez,"&gt;If you offer an API and you store your access tokens in a non ACID environment and you revoke a token, there is no guarantee that token will be revoked immediately when you requested it. When you cycle keys, etc.. The list goes on.

So you can't think of an architecture that doesn't use a token validation system? This sounds like a ""we should use right tool for the job"" kind of statement and not a ""everything must be ACID because X shows that non-ACID is always insecure"" kind of statement. The latter you were trying to show.

&gt; Right now I feel like I am talking to a person who think mongodb is a hammer and everything else is a nail.

Then you haven't been reading my posts at all. I talked about 1 single situation where MongoDB was a good tool to use and I told you my team has been using Redshift for most of our projects. 

&gt;Uh store those in flat files and use hadoop or pick your favorite map reduce to query it. A database is not a place for logs.

We do have a log file on the server, but that only helps us in the scope of our project. Multiple teams need to access this database to put their own json logs in at the same time, and they need to be able to query it. This allows us to see the entire flow of a call that goes from one system to another if we need to. Each call will have a correlationID that you just set as a parameter in your query. 

Yeah, there are many other ways to approach this problem and fix it, but this one works for us and was simple. All these programs were in NodeJS where JSON was native. Pushing to MongoDB was as simple as import MongoDB, get the database instance, and push the data with an added correlationID. It took little to no time to set up, and our code is modular enough that we can switch out logging system easily if we decide we need to do something else in the future. Maybe a new tool will come along and be much better for the job. I have no problem switching. 

The fact that you refuse to answer how long you've been a software developer makes me think you just started. Which is just fine, but don't go around saying everything need to be ACID when you don't have anywhere near enough experience to make such a big claim. That has been my problem this entire time with this community. They hate a tool so much that they pretend it never can be useful. I don't see that with the senior developers around me. They've been around long enough to realize they don't know everything. They limit their serious bashing statements to ""this tool wouldn't work for this project for X, Y, and Z reason."" 

&gt;It's not perfect, sometimes you do have to deal with lock contention on a high traffic server, but at least I know my data is consistent and if the data gets into a weird state, that is on the programmer, not the data store.

That is great. Those technologies are great. They are useful tools in your toolkit to use for the right job. I would never say that those technologies should never be used since they do have their place even if one gets hyped up by idiots. ",1.0
dil249v,6fprez,"Logs with timestamps do not replace transactional integrity. 

In effect, you are saying that you can go back and see ""oh yeah, two people edited the same record at the same time"", despite the fact that the data is now screwed up until you return it to normal, is equivalent to guaranteeing that the record is never edited with race conditions.",1.0
dil2epw,6fprez,"My database for storing the data is ACID. The important data doesn't have that issue.

The logs are logs. They don't have a race condition since they are only adds, never updates. There is only 1 thread working per 1 correlationID. You won't ever get a situation where you don't know the order of events. ",1.0
dike6ki,6fprez,"Woops, I thought this was on programmingcirclejerk and I was joining in. Mongo is a legitimate solution for certain workloads, admittedly I've never used it personally because the types of things I work on tend to be fairly relational in nature and the data is important enough to where everyone wants to be very confident in whatever is holding it. The norm for the most part for me has been some flavor of SQL database and some form of caching strategy, my preference for the cache if it benefits from being separated from the app is Redis which can conveniently also double as a somewhat reliable pubsub (wouldn't use it as a standalone database for sure though).

dikimvi,6fprez,"It's always a matter of ""right tool for the job"". People like to think that people want to shoehorn mongo into making their website.

On the plus side it's easy to setup and begin dumping data into, which like any tool will shoot you in the foot because you forgot to design your data layout properly (which can happen with any database).",0.0

Studly caps is a form of text notation in which the capitalization of letters varies by some pattern, or arbitrarily, usually also omitting spaces between words and often omitting some letters, for example, StUdLyCaPs or STuDLyCaPS. Such patterns are identified by many users, ambiguously, as camel case. The typical alternative is to just replace spaces with underscores (as in snake case).

dhqhvsa,6bwwc2,"In most normal languages, 

    int b;
    bool is_B_Even;
    
    is_B_Even = ((b % 2) == 0) 

In JavaScript b % 2 == 0 in a lot of situations, many of them are negated by b % 2 === 0.  Some aren't. 

For instance:

b = []  
b = ' '  
b = null  
b = false //and any way you arrive at false (1==2) % 2
b = +0

Most people immediately run to parseInt (equivalent to Number.parseInt()) to solve this problem, but then you create new problems.  Due to the nature of things, now you have problems for any time `b` is a floating point number.

Instead you have to use  Number.isInteger(value) before testing b % 2.  Also, you should get back something similar to InvalidArgumentException from non-integers.  

I will say this isn't a unique problem to JavaScript, but instead affects languages with dynamic typing, but JavaScript is probably the language with the most complicated equality.  Because of this interesting behavior and because there aren't methods that do it for you, it's not entirely unreasonable to build little utilities for what seems like it should be language features.",5.0

For best maintainability:

* Use Ruby for everything.
* Use globals everywhere you can.
* Implement your classes in as many monkey patches as possible. 
* Bonus points if you can put the monkey patches in wildly different directories and have it load in such a way that some code depends on being executed before certain monkey patches are loaded, while other code depends on being executed after they are loaded. One great way to do this is to define two methods of the same class with the same name, but completely different functionality. It'll be impossible to tell just from reading that code that the same method does completely different things depending on *when* in the load process it's executed.
* Use lots of namespaces, and within those namespaces, re-use the same 5 class names. Why have just one `Customer` object when you can have a `Logistics::Customer`, an `Operations::CustomerRelations::Customer`, and a `Security::FraudDetection::Customer`, each for completely different purposes? It's extremely difficult to isolate identifiers in a particular namespace using Grep, and even tools like `etags` will force you to wade through all the identifiers that match in all the namespaces.
* Within classes, re-use the same method names. Call the `setx` of one class from the `setx` of another class.
* Give your classes the same names as classes in the Gems you are using, and give them methods with the same names, too. But don't use the Gem's class from your class. Let the naming similarity be a surprise.
* Better yet, monkey patch well-known Gems with completely unrelated functionality. Why shouldn't `JSON.parse` update a database? When they read the source for the JSON gem, they won't see *anything* database-related!
* Write lots of methods that do nothing but call a method of the same name on another object of a different class. This can make it impossible to find the *real* definition of a method using Grep.
* Use gems like FactoryGirl for production code. FactoryGirl has the amazing abiity to produce method definitions out of thin air, with nary a `def foo` in sight! This can help grep-proof your definitions even further.
* Use Rails. It conjures up all kinds of definitions from thin air, and allows you to set up callbacks that get implicitly called from nowhere. It'll leave future maintainers wondering ""How in the fuck is that value non-nil?""

That monitor has a resolution of 2560 x 1440 and a character written in the courier font at 10pt is 9x13 pixels meaning we can fit 284 * 110 characters on this display, meaning we can display 31,240 characters / 32 characters per UUID which gives us 976 UUIDs per screen * 165 refreshes per second, which gives us 161,040 UUIDs per second.

dh22cd2,63id0k,"The basic idea is that javascript doesn't necessarily handle negatives with two's complement, but the bitwise operators always *act* like it does. So in `-~(-1)`, the *only* operation involving two's complement is `~(-1)`, which evaluates to 0. You're then left with `-(0)`, which gives a signed zero as a result.

As for all the strange equivalences, here's a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7223359/are-0-and-0-the-same) answer going into detail about that. 

The `toString` method removes the sign, so both `+0` and `-0` evaluate to `'0'`, but your dev console probably uses a different string converter that includes the sign to help for debugging.

Also, you can tell the two apart in these ways:

`-0 &lt; +0` = `true`  
`-0 &gt; +0` = `false`

edit: oooh I just learned a whole CS101 course in 2 minutes. So they weren't considered languages but physical inputs at one point (akin to manually shifting the OR/ELSE gates), and then Von Neumann realized that was as fun and useful as writing PERL, so decided to invent libraries and GOTO statements, to the delight of lazy programmers and ""Considered Harmful"" computer gurus in the future. Then Grace Hopper gave us the compiler, which let us talk to computers, necessitating the need for language in the first place.

Compression phase:
Calculate SHA-256 hash for file. Store hash along with file length.

Decompression phase:
Create random file of specified length. Calculate SHA-256 hash and compare to stored value. If hashes match, we're done. If not, create new random file and repeat until hashes match.

    int main()

You just gave your app std. 

You need to make it aware of it, to avoid each function of getting a std:

    using namespace std;
    
    int main()
    {
         cout &lt;&lt; ""I am safe now"" &lt;&lt; endl;

    (map fizzbuzz (range 1 101))

As you can see, the functional style provides an elegant FizzBuzz solution that is composable and extendable, with no reliance on icky mutable state such as ""files"" or the ""cloud"".  Also, since Clojure is a JVM language, you can integrate this functional code with code created from lesser imperative languages so that it can feel smug about its overengineered excellence.

After you've mastered the functional FizzBuzz you can move on to parallel FizzBuzz, because a FizzBuzz that doesn't use all your CPU cores is scarcely a FizzBuzz at all.

Every underscore breaks the flow of what you're typing because key placement insists you either use Left Shift for it or contort your right hand into leaving where it should be, whereas when using camelCase or PascalCase you can use whichever Shift key makes the most sense and move on. For this reason alone, camelCase and PascalCase are easier to type on, say, a U.S. keyboard ‚Äî it's really not a matter of opinion unless you just actually don't do all that much typing, or don't have enough faith in your code to write more than one line at a time. It's a question of ergonomics. Is snake_case more readable? Yeah, I'd argue that it is. But it's definitely not easier to type.

**Unless** you've got a dedicated underscore key (which I do on my Japanese machine), in which case this_object_name becomes *significantly* easier than either thisObjectName or ThisObjectName.

Other languages are called *high level languages*, which means they're basically toddlers who need their parents to dress them every day. C, by contrast, is the rugged lumberjack of languages that goes out into the wild and gets its hands dirty.

So my point is that C++'s version of malloc is some wimpy version that can only beg the operating system for more memory, like a little boy saying ""Please sir, can I have some more?"" while C malloc wrests the memory it needs directly from the hardware and tells the operating system to suck it.",25.0

I'm afraid you're mistaking C for *machine language*, the Real Man's programming language. Did you know that *malloc* is actually a macro? Here is its definition:

    #define malloc(bytes) eat_quiche(bytes)

The `eat_quiche` function, naturally, relies of fancy theoretical mathematics invented by ""men"" who traded their balls in for big fancy words like ""abstraction.""

But with SQL, you can query it so that it picks the top, then the top of what remains, then the top of that, and the top of that, and so on, but once you're done, you just return your results, having never actually removed them from the table. Very efficient, and no chance of data loss.

dberlry,5j5ym6,"Here's the thing. You said a ""pupper is a doggo.""

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies puppers, doggos, yappers, and even woofers, I am telling you, specifically, in doggology, no one calls puppers doggos. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""doggo family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, which includes things from sub woofers to birdos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).

So your reasoning for calling a pupper a doggo is because random people ""call the small yip yip ones doggos?"" Let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the doggo family. But that's not what you said. You said a pupper is a doggo, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the doggo family doggos, which means you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species doggos, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

1. You take 10^n and multiply it by 10, getting 10^(n+1).

3. You divide 10^n by 2^(n+1), getting 5^n / 2 as the result. Now let's assume 5^n in binary is `0bABCDEFGH...XYZ1` (because it's uneven by basic arithmetic). 5^n / 2 is then `0bABCD...XYZ.1` as a real binary number (0.1 in binary is 0.5 in decimal). Dropping the fractional part, you arrive at `0bABCD...XYZ`.
4. You then concatenate `0bABCD...XYZ` and `100...n times...0`, which is equivalent to concatenating `0bABCD...XYZ1` and `n` zeros, which is equivalent to concatenating binary(5^n ) and `n` zeroes, which is equivalent to 5^n * 2^n, which is exactly 10^n.

* Lay down your monitor on a flat surface with the picture side upwards.

* *Carefully* melt a small hole in your monitor screen using the heated needle/paperclip.  The hole should be about one third along the side of your screen (this is important, as you don't want to bleed out the wrong ink colour).       
* Slowly lift the other end of the monitor until the blue ink starts flowing out. Be sure to catch the excess ink in the tissue because monitor ink is a righteous bastard to get out of furniture or clothes.

There's a couple other warming features you can use in your PC. Libraries like CUDA will allow you to write your sleep warming functions on the GPU, so your CPU can be free to do other tasks. Alternatively, you can perform lots of reads and writes to your HDD and cd drives, causing them to spin up really fast, creating heat from friction. Or finally, another good way to create heat is to go into your bios and disable your cooling functions. You don't want your PC to think it's too cool or it will stop obeying you anyway. This isn't great for portability though because you cant write that function into your python program.

If you just wanted a sleep function, I personally prefer using a system call to `%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState Standby`, which conveniently sleeps until the user decides to wake the computer up. But this will not warm your room!",73.0

Some of his complaints are not fully explained, like where he says it's possible to run F#, C#, C++, and Python ""at the same time"" (whatever that means), but not Python 2 and Python 3.

He completely misuses the concept of Turing completeness and dynamic vs static typing.

He claims that since there are some languages that can be automatically translated into other languages, that automatically translating any language into any other language is ""a fully solved problem"".

He says that since Python 3 has two different ways of formatting strings, beginners ""have to"" learn them both. I don't see any reason you couldn't just go with one, and anyway both of these ways are also in Python 2.

His opinion that Python 3's string handling is worse than Python 2's is, to say the least, in the minority. He's entitled to that opinion I guess, but he makes a pretty poor case for it, given how many reasons there are to disagree with it. This is especially true when you have to deal with languages other than English.

He goes on and on about how his catstring function is broken because if he randomly mixes strings with byte arrays (which aren't strings, if that isn't clear), it doesn't behave as he expected.  What does he expect?

Following that same logic, numbers are statically typed and broken in Python 3 as well!  Check out this example:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; def addnumber(a, b):
    ...     return a + b
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; addnumber('1', '2')
    '12'

Oh no, numbers in Python3 are statically typed and broken!!!  If I pass in these things that are numbers because I wished they were really hard, they STILL don't behave as numbers!

&gt; As long as it behaves like another type, I am free to effectively pretend it is that other type.

He's completely missing the entire point, that strings and byte arrays don't behave like each other because they are completely different things with different behavior for very good and obvious reasons.

And then to further drive home the point that he's completely confused and out his depth, he then runs his byte array through format to implicitly convert it to a string, and then wonders why arbitrary binary data isn't being magically decoded by python3 making an educated guess as to what the data represents.

I'm also using a DEBUG tag to mark temporary code, but the thing is I like to review stuff before committing, and it doesn't stand out as much as a non-indent in a diff view. I have to remember to check the IDE's task list for any lingering DEBUG tags, while in C/C#/Java I can just look at the commit diff and it will be pretty obvious if there is something that should be removed... or I could even un-stage the offending line right there, keeping the commit clean while the local code dirty.

&gt;Currently you cannot run Python 2 inside the Python 3 virtual machine. Since I cannot, that means Python 3 is not Turing Complete and should not be used by anyone.

&gt;but until they do it then they have decided to say that Python 3 cannot run one other Turing complete language so logically Python 3 is not Turing complete.

You can't run C# or Java bytecode on the Python 3 virtual machine either. Nor can you run Python 2 on a C# or Java virtual machine. And you can't run any of these things through a C compiler.

Therefore nothing is Turing complete. QED.

&gt;Statically Typed Strings

This whole section is retarded because Zed Shaw doesn't know that in python2 `str` and `bytes` are aliases, and `unicode` is separate. And in python3 `str` and `unicode` are aliases and `bytes` are separate. i.e. he incorrectly claims that he's using Unicode in his python2 example when he isn't -- he's using `bytes` both times.

He also completely misunderstands what static typing is. Does he realise applications could send you `ints` or `FooBar` objects instead of strings, right? That's the danger of dynamic typing.

    Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.
    Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.
    Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.

JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that allows you to create dynamic HTML pages, allowing you to process input data and maintain data, usually within the browser.
Java is a programming language, core set of libraries, and virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform, without distribution of source code in its raw form or recompilation.


While the two have similar names, they are really two completely different programming languages/models/platforms, and are used to solve completely different sets of problems.

Also every line you write, can contain a bug. While complicated lines should be broken up in simpler statements, to avoid bugs, adding redundant statements to a single statement is not simplification. You have to evaluate the condition anyway.
I noticed often enough that my peers like to split boolean conditions i.e. if (( a == false &amp;&amp; b == true) || (a==true &amp;&amp; b == false)) at the || , because the expression is hard to parse instead of just evaluating if(a!=b).
That maybe is not bad code in itself, but it's the first step.

for( i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++ ) vec[i]  = func( vec2[i];

vec.x = func(vec.x);
vec.y = func(vec.y);

d97vbna,59e9pl,"Your problem is that your arrows are being interpreted as a comment. Developers often leave comments to themselves so they remember what the intention of their code was. For example, in C++, a comment may look like this:

    /* Increment i by 1
        /* Because i is the next element */
    */
    #define SEMICOLON ;
    #define ADD +
    i = i ADD 1 SEMICOLON

In HTML, comments look like this:

    &lt;!-- increment i by 1 --&gt;

But there's good news: you can ""escape"" things with a backslash. Try this:

    \-\-\&gt;

Those backslashes tell the compiler that your arrow is not a comment. So, in full:

Without pieplining, this is how instructions would run  


    1: ---  
    2:     -----  
    3:           -----  


But with pipeling, the same code can be run like this:



    1:---  
    2: -----  
    3:  -----  

As you can see, the code finishes almost 3 times faster because it can run almost in parallell.

The more pipelines you have in your computer, the faster it will be. If you have ever built a PC, you will know that your powersupply has tons of wires or 'pipelines' going to the motherboard, most modern ones have at least 24. A microwave that has only one cable therefore only has one pipeline and things get very slow.

The formula for calculating how much faster a pipelined CPU can run instructions, the following formula can be used

```
instructions_per_second = core_frequency * + (25 / amount_of_pipelines) * core_frequency / 10
```
This is why PSUs only have 24 pipelines and not hundreds of them. As you can see from this [plot](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=25%2Fx), the benefit of adding more pipelines decreaces as the amount of pipelines increaces. Adding more would simply be too expensive for the average consumer.

I know! Liquid cooled microwaves!

We could put some copper heatsinks inside so the heat is more evenly distributed",4.0

d8ve21q,57u9x6,"Well, you aren't thinking like a proper programmer. Programmers work in 'binary'. If you convert  your childish ascii representation of 'your mom' to binary, you get:
'0111100101101111011101010111001000100000011011010110111101101101'

A number equivalent to 8750341734034927469 in decimal.

Now, to get the full effects of this number it might be worth combining it in effects that both the layman and the l33tboiz can understand, so go into 'vim', and type in 8750341734034927469, press 'i', type in 'your mom', and then press escape. Just save that file, and voila, you have both an accurate representation of your mother, and a file that meets your needs. Have fun!",23.0
