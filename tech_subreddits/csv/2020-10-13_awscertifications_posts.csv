jagnku,Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) For A Complete Beginner," Amazon EC2 is a service that allows you businesses to run their application in AWS cloud. You can easily set up a virtual machine and perform all your computation on it. In this post, we will teach you the basics of Amazon EC2.

# Introduction

* EC2 is one of the oldest and fundamental services of AWS.
* Though everything today is serverless, you still need to know EC2.
* EC2 allows you to do the following things :
* Rent virtual machines (EC2 itself)
* Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
* Distributing load across the machines (ELB)
* Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

# Amazon Machine Image – AMI

* AMIs are the templates from which virtual servers (EC2 instance) get created.
* In simple terms, AMIs are the collection of the operating system, architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) with the softwares that will be running on that operating system.
* For example :
* Amazon Linux AMI is the one that comes with a Linux operating system and many packages of the Linux that one might need.
* Windows AMI comes with Windows as its operating system and software one might need.
* By choosing AMI you basically decide the software part of your EC2 machine.
* You can use a single AMI and launch multiple instances from it.

# Instance Type

* As we have seen AMI defines the software part of your EC2, Instance type defines the hardware part of your EC2 machine.
* It is when you choose instance type you define the hardware configuration of your EC2 machines.
* Hardware configurations involve Memory, vCPUs, instance storage, network performance parameters.
* This instance types are categorized on the basis of what kind of requirement you have with your EC2 machines.

# Features 

* **Instance :** It provides you a virtual environment (instances) for your computing tasks.
* **AMIs :** It comes with set of many preconfigured templates for your instances known as Amazon Machine Images, that saves you the efforts of manually installing operating system and additional softwares and configuring them.
* **Instance Type :** You get a wide range of configurations of CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types. This allows you to select any power of computation as per your requirement.
* **Key Pairs :** EC2 comes with secure login also. It provides login through key pairs where AWS stores the public key and you store the private key.
* **Instance Store Volume :** By default it provides you storage volume to store your temporary data (data that gets deleted when you stop your instance) known as instance store volume.
* **Amazon EBS volume :** If you want to store your data even after your instance get stopped, EC2 provides you  persistent storage volume for your instance known as Amazon EBS volume.

jag47d,AWS IAM OVERVIEW,"#  

# IAM INTRODUCTION :

* **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** **is a service that allows you to manage users and their access to AWS.**
* **Your whole AWS security revolves around IAM.**
* **IAM is a global service. It’s not bound to any specific region.**
* **IAM allows you to control**  
**Identity: who can use your AWS resources (Authentication)**  
**Access: what resources they can use (Authorization)**
* **When you create AWS account, that very first account is called as Root account.**
* **When you first start with AWS you get a root access key. Root access key provides complete access to your AWS account and you should never use them.**
* **So you basically need to delete your root access key.**
* **You can set up MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for extra security.**

IAM FEATURES :

* **IAM provides you with centralized control of your AWS account.**
* **It provides shared access to your AWS account.**  
**You can grant other people access to your AWS account.**
* **It allows you to set Granular permissions.**  
**You can grant specific permission to specific users. For example, you might allow a user access to only some set of services only.**
* **Identity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn etc)**  
**Users can log in by using their company credentials without having an account with AWS.**
* **Multifactor Authentication**  
**This is two-factor authentication. User not only need to provide password or access key but also code from physical devices such as android or ios smartphone.**
* **Support PCI DSS compliance.**  
**IAM supports the processing, storage, and transmission of credit card data**
* **Provide application running on EC2 access to AWS resources.**  
**You can have your application running on EC2 secure access to AWS resource.**
* **IAM integrates with almost every AWS service.**  
**Since it’s a fundamental or core service that provides security, IAM integrates with almost all AWS services.**
* **Free to use**  
**IAM is a completely free service to use.**

IAM COMPONENTS :USERS

* **User is an AWS identity.**
* **User is basically a physical person.**
* **This physical person will get an account in IAM.**
* **New users have no permission when first created.**

GROUP

* **Group basically means a set of IAM users.**
* **Groups are basically defined by their function for example Developers, Admin etc.**
* **Instead of assigning the same permission to every other user individually, you can assign that permission to group and add all the users in that group.**
* **All the users in this group will inherit the permission of the group.**

ROLES

* **Role is an IAM identity that has specific permissions.**
* **Role is similar to User.**
* **But it is not associated with a specific person, a role is assumed by anyone who needs it.**
* **Role doesn’t have standard long term credentials such as password, it works on temporary security credentials for a session.**
* **Roles can be assigned to :**  
**An IAM user in the same account as role in.**  
**An IAM user in a different account than the role.**  
**An AWS service such as EC2.**

POLICIES

* **Policies are JSON documents.**
* **They define what User, Group and Roles can do or cannot do.**
* **Permissions are governed by policies.**
* **AWS provides you with many built-in policies that already have permissions according to use cases. This is the AWS managed policies.**
* **You can also create your own policy as well.**

IAM FEDERATION

* **IAM Federation is a feature which can be used by big enterprises.**
* **Generally, big enterprises have their own repository of users.**
* **Using IAM Federation such enterprises can integrate their own repository of users with IAM.**
* **This way users of such enterprises can log in into AWS using their company credentials.**
* **Identity Federation uses the SAML standard**

ja9ai1,List of online AWS training providers,"Just wondering if anybody has compiled a list of current online training providers for the AWS certs — both training courses and practice test providers?

Perhaps if we put our heads together this could be compiled into a Wiki? Or at least this thread.

I believe I read here that there's a difference between shorter bootcamp style courses and longer ones. I'm not familiar with the latter but created a heading for it. I'm also adding their common abbreviations as they get referred to be those a lot on Reddit, it seems.

The main ones I'm familiar with are (I'm sure I'm missing plenty):

**Practice Exams**

* Tutorials Dojo (TD)

**Preparation Courses - Unsorted**

* Stefan Maarke - Udemy
* Zeal Vora - Udemy
* Linux Academy (LA)
* A Cloud Guru (ACG)
* Pluralsight
* Digital Cloud Training

**Preparation Courses - Shorter**

**Preparation Courses - Longer**

* Adrian Cantrill

ja8mua,Another ambiguously worded question from Niel's CAA-S02 practice exam questions,"How could I better interpret this question.. to me it's a bit poorly worded or doesn't have enough context. 

From what I understand, you must have specified your instance store up front, at the time of provisioning your EC2 instance. The question doesn't even mention that there was any existing instance store, thus, this would require you to re-provision your entire EC2 instance in order to create the instance storage. The ""correct"" answer only says ""Move the temporary DB onto instance storage"", without indicating that they would need to re-provision an EC2 instance....

This is the only reason why I selected to put the temp DB on a new 50GB EBS io1 volume as this would not require reprovisioning of a new EC2 instance.

Now I truly understand what everyone means when they say that Niel's questions aren't worded well nor contain enough detail.

ja899d,To CCP or not to CCP,"I was reading a couple of threads on this sub recently and noticed that there seem to be differing opinions as to whether the CCP is worth doing at all.

I'm a technology writer that works with a few clients in the cloud world. I'm interested in taking an AWS cert both to demonstrate subject matter expertise and (potentially down the road) to begin segueing into technology itself. Perhaps TAM or something knows. Who knows. I want to keep my career options option. And cloud to me seems like a rock solid place to be over the medium term.

My rationale for thinking about thinking about skipping to Solutions Architect is that I've read that there's a lot of overlap between the two but that SA is obviously more in depth. I'm not in a rush to pass the certification, but I've also already invested a lot of time on Tutorials Dojo and Udemy to get to scoring 80% average in the practice tests (I need 90% before trying the real exam).

I'm also really enjoying the material. So if another few months of study could get me something more impressive ... part of me thinks that it makes sense to rationalize my efforts and focus on the better credential. But on the flip side, right now my use-case is going to be non-technical — which makes CCP sound like a better fit.

**My question is: do most people follow the certification ladder sequentially? And is SA a bigger leap beyond CCP than I'm envisioning?**

Also thanks to whoever recommended Stephane Maarek's Udemy course to me! I trained with one of the big online cloud training providers but felt like it left an awful lot of knowledge gaps. Stephane takes things so slowly that it feels a little tedious at times ... but preferable to rushing through the syllabus and missing things.",4,awscertifications,2020-10-13

It didn’t help that the stupid PearsonVue app kept thinking there was a new “face” in the room so the proctor kept pausing the damn exam and made me sweep the camera around the room probably 5 times to make sure I didn’t have anyone helping me.

I started with Java for android then Google announced they moved to Kotlin first I started learning Kotlin but realized that this will probably be another 2 years.
I looked at It as being a foot in the door and to see what I really wanted to pursue. I took the google IT supports specialist program which is really just a good job sticker on your lunch box and doesn't carry any weight in the real world.

j9htjx,Passed SAA-C02 today! My journey and notes.,"Passed SAA-C02 exam today on the first try. I wanted to share my journey and the resources that helped me the most.

\*\*\*

**How long did you prepare for?**

I prepared for about 1.5 months and have some cloud experience with both AWS and Azure.

**Which resources did you use?**

I started off with A Cloud Guru's SAA course on Udemy but switched to [Stephane Maarek's SAA course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/)midway. I found Maarek's course to cover more depth and provide a better understanding of the various services.

Once done with the course, I took a total of 12 practice exams by [Neal Davis](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-tests-k/) and [Tutorials Dojo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/)(TD/Jon Bonso) and scored between 75-90 on all of them. I felt Neal's exams were a bit tougher than TD but TD's exam questions were a bit more realistic and situation-based.

I'd say the actual exam was halfway between TD and Neal and so, would recommend taking both.

**How was your exam day experience?**

I had read the comments here so I cleaned my desk, disconnected all the external monitors and put a DND sign outside my door. I started the process at 4:30pm, 30 minutes before my exam. They'll make you upload a bunch of photos including a selfie, an ID and your surroundings. Once you submit these photos, you have to wait for the proctor to arrive and begin your exam.

I started off slow and flagged a lot of questions for reviews. I returned to the flagged questions when I had an hour remaining. Slogged through them, contemplating over the answers and finished everything with 10 minutes remaining. For some reasons, I had a LOT of questions on Storage Gateway!

Once I submitted my exam, I had to finish a short survey and after that came the long awaited screen displaying **PASS** in bold letters!

\*\*\*

I created my own notes based on Maarek's course, TD cheat sheets, AWS FAQs and Neal Davis exams: [https://www.notion.so/rxhl/AWS-SAA-698442acf94a484caa56477344dafc9d](https://www.notion.so/rxhl/AWS-SAA-698442acf94a484caa56477344dafc9d)",49,awscertifications,2020-10-13
j9fkqt,Passed SAA-02! Looking for advice on advanced networking next steps,"Hi all - thanks for all the great posts - all the information was a big help.  For my primary study guide I used the AWS documentation.  Next I used the Bonso Cheat sheets and practice tests (invaluable - I just wish there had been more questions they were so good).  The Neal Davis practice tests were great for the content of the questions but light on explanations which was fine since I had the AWS documentation to use.  What I really needed was the practice tests which were very good.

Next I am targeting the Advanced Networking Specialty on my way to the Security cert.  What are you folks using for a study reference?  Almost all of the books I found on Amazon are 2-3 years old - I don't know if that matters or not.  Any specific white papers or other online references would be greatly appreciated too.",2,awscertifications,2020-10-13
j97acm,Resources beyond Tutorial Dojo and Linux Academy (AWSCCP),"Hi guys,

I'm currently taking the practice tests on Tutorials Dojo for the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

I know that this thing is supposed to be super easy, but I'm only scoring 70-80% on average on the practice tests ... and I've heard that you should get 90% or so until you book a test.

FWIW I'm a technology writer. So I'm not coming from a tech background as such, although I've been using AWS for my own purposes for a few years.

I took and enjoyed the Linux Academy course. But I'm thinking that, as I'm effectively coming from a zero in terms of my technical background, that I need a longer and more in depth course before even getting to this stage.

Anything anybody can recommend? If I pass, I'd love to move on to Solutions Architect. So something that offers training for a few levels on the certification ladder would be great too.

j8m7ma,Passed Solution Architect Professional test yesterday!,"Finally passed my SAP test on the second try yesterday. Wanted to share my experience if it's useful for anyone else. 

Stephane Maarek's SAP course ( https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional/ ) is an absolute must. I also made it through a good chunk of Adrian Cantrill's Linux Academy course before ACG bought them. His new Pro course isn't finished yet, but when it is, absolutely use it. 

Speaking of A Cloud Guru, I was previously a big fan of them, as I used their courses to pass my Solution Architect Associate and my Security Specialty exams. Sadly, though, their current SAP course is AWFUL. It feels like a super low effort course that hits a few bullet points per topic and then sends you off to read white papers for hours. 

I didn't take any practice exams, as I had taken this test before and knew somewhat of what to expect. The biggest thing I noticed is that it was easier to eliminate some of the wrong answers to the questions by reading them carefully. Many of the incorrect answers were obvious because they listed services as doing things they cannot do (for example, one answer said ""Use AWS Inspector to filter traffic"", which it obviously doesn't do). It took me about 2 hours and 15 minutes to complete the 75 questions, and that was including time to review any I was unsure of. 

I had questions from a broad range of topics, but it seemed like many of them ended up being a scenario, and then the question would be ""How do you architect this for better operational overhead?""

Marked the hard questions for review until the end of the exam to not get stuck and answered all the easier questions first.

Used Adrian Cantril's AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02) course at [https://learn.cantrill.io/](https://learn.cantrill.io/)

BTW: totally recommend using his course, also bought another video bundle from him which i will use to go after the SA-PRO Certification.

Also used Tutorial Dojo practice exams + Tutorial Dojo Study guide and cheat sheets

[https://tutorialsdojo.com/](https://tutorialsdojo.com/)

The exam was similar to Tutorial Dojo practice exams (the difficulty level). And i was scoring around 93 % on the practice exams in the end (But then i had gone through the practice exams twice).

I recommend taking a screenshot of incorrect answers while going through  Tutorial Dojo practice exams and review them on exam day.

I firstly went though [u/acantril](https://www.reddit.com/u/acantril/)'s Solutions Architect Associate course ( [https://learn.cantrill.io/](https://learn.cantrill.io/) ). It's an amazing and high quality course, teaches you how to pass the exam, but also how to be a solutions architect (a personal favourite of mine was when he described how he would go about designing a VPC network / IP range that would meet a clients / projects needs).

I then finished off with [u/jon-bonso-tdojo](https://www.reddit.com/u/jon-bonso-tdojo/)'s practice questions ([https://tutorialsdojo.com/](https://tutorialsdojo.com/)). Due to time constraints I only got about 20% through the full course of questions and was hitting high 80% by the end. The questions feel a decent amount harder than the exam, but really helped to prepare me for the type of questions that would be asked, again another fantastic resource!

The topics that came up most in my exam were:

· AutoScaling Groups (ASG)

· Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

· Databases (RDS + DynamoDB and the occasional Redshift question)

· Containers (ECS &amp; Fargate)

For my prep I used the following;

1. Ultimate AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate course from Stephane Maarek
2. Tutorial Dojo Practice Exams.
3. Searching Google for specific questions I had during practice exams to try to work out the best answer and why.

Took about 5 weeks to do the prep and did the exam today using the VUE online System.

Regarding the Online VUE system, I did all the pretests and sat and waiting for 33 minutes before the proctor joined, I thought something had gone wrong as after 15 minutes I still did not have exam started and the system gave me a message saying ""something"" could be wrong. I was trying to get the online chat to work on VUE website, but while waiting the VUE software went live and the proctor starting talking via chat to sort getting exam started. Saying that they were very busy and sorry for the wait. 

Anyway I want to start the next course ""Ultimate AWS Certified Solution Architect Professional 2020"" by Stephane Maarek, but Udemy wants to charge me £125 which no way i'm paying that..

j7wgxe,Looking to get certified,"Hi All!

I set up my business a couple of years back and doing really well now. I'm looking to hire some people in the near future. However, before everything starts going gangbusters I would like to try and get some certifications with AWS under my belt. The last qualification I got was my degree 5 years ago from University back in the UK for Business Information Technology.

I have since moved to NZ and have been using AWS for about 3 years. Developing primarily with ECS, S3, Lambda, SQS, EC2, SES. Over the next few years I'll be hoping to hand off much of the development to new members of the team. 
I would like to focus more on the business/requirement gathering and making deals than coding 24/7. Node.js and MongoDB have served me very well in allowing me to start my business, but there are much better developers out there than me haha!

My business is focused around B2B integration into ERP systems, web scraping and e-commerce.

The real questions I have on my mind...
- Is it worth doing the AWS cloud practitioner?
- Should I go for solutions architect or developer?

j7wcgm,Passed SysOps Administrator Associate (SOA) Exam,"First of all, thank you u/jon-bonso-tdojo and u/stephanemaarek

I couldn't have done this without either of you &lt;3

Second of all, man that was a tough exam. I got so many Cloud Formation questions that I wasn't expecting at all. There were actually very few questions from Networking (VPCs), EC2, Storage or Databases. Mostly it was CFromation, AWS Organizations, IAM, ELB/ASG and  Monitoring/Troubleshooting.

Preparation I did was using Stephane's course and Jon's tests. Along with that I made liberal use of the cheat sheets over at the tutorial dojo website. Specially the ""Difference between services"" pages. It took me slightly more than a month to prepare and it also helped that I've been in Operations role before so it was easier to pick up concepts and translate them to AWS scenarios.

Score I got is 764 which to me is really lower than what I had hoped coming out of the exam and way lower than what I had hoped going into it. I'd like to blame myself for not paying attention to Cloud Formation much but hey, a win is a win. From here on, I'd like to work towards Database Speciality exam since that is what I've been doing for the past 4 years. Maybe DevOps Professional if I actually get into a DevOps/CICD role using the skills I've earned so far.

j7heyq,Passed SAA-C02! Here's what helped me.,"Passed the SAA-C02 after the 2nd attempt. Studied using only Cloud Guru the first time, and failed (695). Then discovered this subreddit and learned about Stephane Maarek and tutorial dojos, and was able to pass it the 2nd try with a 780.

Heres the study method that helped me the best:

\- Of course, watch the full course and take notes. What I did was I waited until I finished the course, then went back to read and highlight the important things in my notes.

\- After that, I wouldn't even take the practice exams in the course yet, I would start with the Tutorial Dojo tests. The ones on [their website](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/), not the Udemy ones. These practice exams are a BIG HELP, as they are just as tricky as the real exam.

\- So Tutorial Dojo has their tests split into different categories; Timed Mode, Review Mode, Section Based, Topic Based, and Final Test (which is honestly the same thing as the Timed exams). Dont stress if you fail hard the first couple of times. Understanding the wording and finesse of the test itself is a whole other thing to learn. Doing them this way helped me the best:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Start with Topic Based tests. Take each one, if you fail one, go back to the Udemy course you took and re watch the topic of the test you just took. After that, go back and retry the exam one more time. Repeat for all topics.
2. Next, do the Section Based tests. Like the Topic Based ones, if you fail one, go back and look at the questions you got wrong, try finding the sections where they're talked about in the Udemy class, and take one more time. Avoid taking any of these tests more than 2 times, as you could risk memorizing the questions.
3. Now we move onto the Review Mode exams. These are a bit longer, 30 questions each. Just take each exam, if you fail one, just review what questions you got wrong and read the explanations, then move on to the next one.  Hopefully by the end of this section, you'll be adjusted to the wording of the questions/answers. 
4. Finally, we move onto the Timed Mode/Final Test. I put these in the same category because they're essentially the same thing. Take these as if you were taking the real thing, and once you start hitting 80+, I would say you're ready for the real thing.

\- Now the actual test itself was very tricky/hard lol. There were only about 5 easy questions, the rest were similar to the harder questions in the tutorial dojo practice exams, so my brain was fried after I finished the exam. But if you're freaked out after reading that, don't worry, because according to their [scoring system](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/demystifying-your-aws-certification-exam-score/), the harder your questions are, the less you need to get right in order to pass. Hence, the easier your questions are, the more you need right. 

\- A lot of S3 (I surprisingly had about 4 questions on intelligent tiering). A lot of ASG and data base questions, especially on RDS. I would say that made up about 70% of the exam. Only about 7-10 questions were on DynamoDB. A couple of questions on lambda and KMS/secruity, but alot of them were combined with the data base questions. Lastly, did get like 5 questions on ECS/containers. Only a couple of ELB questions.  No questions really on IAM.

Thats all I can really think of for now, but if you have any questions at all, feel free to PM me! Thanks again to Stephane Maarek, the Tutorial Dojo team, and of course this subreddit! :)))",44,awscertifications,2020-10-13

I used a youtube course from Andrew at ExamPro u/omenking for a great overview of all the services.   
I used a backspace academy course on udemy I bought a while back. This had some pretty good labs.  
I used the Jon Bonso practice exams on udemy I got on sale last year.  The explanations on the questions are where I learned the most details and gotchas related to thinking about the questions properly.   


As far as the test, just make sure to look for what they are specifically asking. Often the question would invalidate half the scenario by asking you for the cheapest way, or Most secure, or Most something, and then multiple answers would look correct, but only one is the MOST whatever they are asking. Also if the question asked for a solution to meet multiple requirements (scalable, fault-tolerant, etc) make sure your answer actually meets all 2 or 3 requirements listed. A lot of answers look good but are only partial solutions.

I have a full time job and a family so I've been trying to get through Stephane's course since 8/12 or so. 

I went through Stephane's slides again and retook the quizzes and did better. What I'm concerned about with TutorialDojo is memorizing the questions on the practice test.

j64f59,Proctoring - can I have turned off monitors?,"Hi folks,

Looking at doing the AWSCP exam soon through remote proctoring.

Day to day, I work at a desktop which has three monitors on a mount.

I live in a fairly small apartment and this room (my home office) is probably the best to do the test in — it's relatively small, cubic, and has no other screens besides those on the mount.

My question is whether the proctor will likely have a problem with me bringing in my laptop and using it at the desk while my desktop is powered off (but the screens are turned off but on the mount).

Otherwise I'm going to have to do the test in my bedroom, which would feel weird, or deconstruct my mount just for an hour - which seems stupid.

Sorry if this is overthinking things. I've heard the proctors are really strict!",2,awscertifications,2020-10-13
j61za6,S3 Encryption sample question,"There's a question posted here, that I want to get clarification on: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/ik2b57/aws\_certified\_developer\_dvap01\_practice\_exam\_s3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/ik2b57/aws_certified_developer_dvap01_practice_exam_s3/)

&gt;A company wants to store sensitive user data in Amazon S3 and encrypt this data at rest.  The company must manage the encryption keys themselves and use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption.  
&gt;  
&gt;How can a developer meet these requirements ?  
&gt;  
&gt;A. Enable default encryption for the S3 bucket using a customer-provided keys option.  
B. Provide a private encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.  
C. Provide a public encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.  
D. Provide a symmetric encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.

Right off the bat I agree with the original poster that B/C are not options as S3 encryption supports symmetric encryption only.

That original post that I linked above only has a single response, and that person says that D) is talking about client-side encryption, so therefore the answer is A).  But is D) really talking about client-side encryption?  Wouldn't client-side encryption be using some external tools to encrypt the data *before* sending it to S3?  Option D here is saying that you *provide* the key to S3, and that S3 does the encryption (so this seems to satisfy the question wording of, ""use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption"").

With A), it seems like a trick question, because the stipulation in the question is that the company must ""manage the encryption keys.""  And when you enable Default Encryption for a bucket, your two choices are:

* AES-256 (SSE-S3) --- this is not a choice that will satisfy this answer
* AWS-KMS (SSE-KMS) --- but could this?

By default, when you create a KMS CMK, the key material is generated by AWS, which does not satisfy the requirement of the company managing the key.  However I was just searching and found that you can actually import your own key material into a CMK: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html) which in this case seems like it *would* allow you manage the encryption key content yourself, but just in the form of KMS CMK.

I feel like the wording on A) with ""customer-provided keys"" implies that it's saying to use a choice other than AES-256 and AWK-KMS (which isn't an option), so I feel like the answer is actually D)...",2,awscertifications,2020-10-13

j5rs4c,Amazon Web Services launches new certification program," Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched a Global Certification Program, which will allow solutions architects, systems operations administrators, and developers to get proof of their cloud know-how.

The new program has been designed to certify the technical skills and knowledge associated with ""building secure and reliable cloud-based applications using AWS technology,"" Amazon [said](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2013/04/30/announcing-amazon-web-services-global-certification-program/).

A solutions architect is a person who knows the ins and outs of designing distributed applications and systems on the AWS platform, while a sysops administrator is responsible for the operational health of an application running on Amazon's cloud. The latter should have in-depth knowledge of the application or service being operated, including how the application is constructed, deployed, and automated, as well as the controls and monitoring points available, according to Amazon. Developers in turn design and build AWS-based applications.

There are three different levels to choose from: associate, professional and master. To earn a certification for one of the three levels, candidates must pass an exam, which will be administered through Kryterion testing centers in more than 100 countries and 750 testing locations worldwide. Training and other resources from Amazon will offer help when preparing.

The program will be rolled out in multiple steps. The first certification to be offered is the AWS Certified Solutions Architect at an Associate Level, Amazon said. To pass that level, candidates are expected to have an understanding of elasticity and scalability concepts as well how network technologies relate to Amazon's cloud. Another important part is understanding how to interact with AWS services, including APIs (application programming interfaces) and SDKs (software development kits).

Certifications for the other two roles will become available later this year, Amazon said. On its certification website there is [more information to be found.](http://aws.amazon.com/certification/)

The Q/A portion of his tests seems to have other learners rant about how his questions and answers are just worded so poorly, so I feel like I’m not the only one. It gives me anxiety that I actually feel well prepared on most of the topics that will be covered on the exam - then jump on one of his test and feel like I know absolutely nothing. 

Tl;dr - Just felt like letting this out and seeing if anyone had suggestions on a DECENT set of practice tests that can closely resemble the types of questions  Amazon will ask on the exam, like not TOO much stuff in the question or too little to leave you wondering what they’re even asking.

I am sharing experience of Roy Middleton who have passed AWS Certified Solutions Architect  Associate (SAA-C02) exam.

* Lots of scenarios about serverless, microservices, containerized (Fargate/ECS) and high-performance architectures.
* Lots of new services: WorkDocs, Snowmobile, DataSync
* Saw scenarios where you need to choose between EFS and FSx.
* Lots of questions about S3 and its features like S3 Events.
* Lots of container topics: Docker, ECS, ECS tasks, port mapping, Fargate and how ECS tasks communicate

**Exam Tips:**

* Don't drink lots of fluid 2 hours before your exam
* When your exam starts, you will see a floating window with **Chat** and **Whiteboard** buttons. You can't use a paper or pen on your desk if you're doing an online exam. The exam has many difficult scenarios where you need visualize stuff. Click the Whiteboard button so you can draw up.
* The official AWS practice test is good. I saw similar scenarios in the official practice tests to the actual exam. I also recommend using tutorials dojo practice exams to get more updated scenarios for practice. Use both Timed-mode first then Review-mode exams when you're about to take the exam. The ACG Exam Simulator is also good but it's not yet fully updated to SAA-C02 new version.

j3e06j,Just passed the Solution Architect Associate Exam! Looking to get a DevOps Engineer Professional. Should I get a Developer Associate or SysOps Administrator Associate next?,"So, to give a little background before asking my question. I have a CS degree and graduated with it about a year ago. Also, I have about a year experience as a full stack dev. But was laid off about 3 months ago. I figured during the break I could get some certs. 

I just passed the Solution Architect Exam. My aim next was to get a DevOps Professional Cert. But I realize I need a Developer or SysOps Associate to go for that one.

Which one should I choose? Developer or SysOps Associate? What is the advantages and/or disadvantages to either?

Also, I guess I little background of my goals. I have mixed goals. On the one hand, I would love to work mainly with the cloud. So, doing something more away from coding and more on the Operations side. I heard devOps roles may be the closest thing to this? I realize ""devOps"" is more a ""minset"" thing, but jobs are being called this now. But...I don't know how realistic it is for me to find a job like that.

If something isn't available like that, then I may see the need to go with the Developer Associate, since I guess I would have to stick with the Dev jobs for a bit.

My honest dislike for the Dev jobs is my first job was super toxic. It felt like the manager had unrealistic expectations for junior developers and also didn't provide any assistance (or get senior devs to help. I asked around too and was proactive and got ""punished/feedback"" for asking questions). Also, recently turned down a new job offer a couple months back because I got the same vibe from that job.

This toxic experience and expecting you to learn 500+ things and sink or swin attitude is what turns me off about developer jobs. Mainly why I want to go to something that is more on the operations side. Where it feels things are more defined.

I guess I'm just at a cross roads. Wondering which one would be best given my goals. Also, open to career advice as well. 

Thanks for any help with any guidance to this.",6,awscertifications,2020-10-13

The opportunity to do this certificate for free on pluralsight came up and I am about 3/4 of the way through the course. The reason it was free was because my state was trying to certify ppl in things that could get them jobs after, but this certainly looks like a more ""down the road"" certification.

What do I need to do to make use of this certificate? Get a beginner level job in IT first? Do other certs first and then look for an IT job? Then go into AWS?

I did a coding boot camp (was for web dev) after high school and many college CS classes in high school. And also went to college for CS for about a year, but college wasn't for me. So I am very familiar with computers.

* Don't fret if your confidence level is only around 60 - 70%. I was in the same boat but I did not procrastinate or reschedule the exam because that would only add to my anxiety.
* Keep practicing as many questions as possible. It's important to get into the exam mode at least for a week or two so you are ready for it on the big day.
* Jon Bonso, Stephen Maarek, A Cloud Guru are all good sources from the exam. I prepared primarily from A Cloud Guru but used practice questions from all these resources. It was a machine learning process - tune yourself and test again.
* Be prepared to face a curve-ball in your exam but the practice from above sources will keep you head in good space.
* Review your answers - irrespective of whether you got it right or wrong. There's a good chance we might have answered something without knowing it was the right answer and we might end up making a mistake on the same when we go for a retry.
* S3, Networking, Databases, High Availability form the core of this exam but other topics are important too. Please make sure to prepare around everything but have deep emphasis around these topics.

1. Run micro services in containers using beanstalk 
2. Run in lambda behind API gateway

j2dzl7,Passed SAA-C02 on my first attempt with 810s/1000. Here's some tips:,"Resources used:  
\- Worked with AWS for about 6 months.  
\- Total study time between 80-90hrs  
\- Used the CloudGuru SAA-C02 course that's available on Linux Academy at 1.5x speed. This was primarily just to get some exposure to services which I may not have much experience with through work. Use the Exam Tips slides Kroonenberg goes through at the end of each lecture.  
\- Jon Bonso's Practice Tests:   
 

|1st attempt|76|76|78|68|73|78|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2nd attempt (3 weeks later)|85|94|91|86|86|\-|

\- In my opinion, the actual SAA-C02 is tougher than Bonso's exams.   
\- Reviewing your wrong answers is sort of tricky because you'll inadvertently memorize answers the answers. Its best to look through why all the other answers were wrong also.   
\- My first attempt was done BEFORE studying/watching videos to gauge myself on where I stood  
\- Studied for about 20 days (easily between 2-5 productive hrs a day)  
\- PearsonVue is kinda annoying. You might have to wait 15-20 minutes for your proctor to show up. Maybe even more based on horror stories I've read here...

On course material and here in this subreddit, there's a lot of mention about SAA-C02-specific content like DataSync, Storage Gateway, FSx, Global Accelerator, AWS Organizations etc. You should take the time to skim through them and know what they are generally used for... **However**, your main focus should be the backbone AWS services like EC2, ELB, Networking, Storage (S3, EBS), Databases (RDS, Dynamo,Aurora), and CDN. If you're not comfortable with these main services, it's a tough exam.

I finished my check-in process before 15 mins of exam start time and then I got paused at the step “You are almost done with the check-in process” . When my scheduled time started it gave me link for help or reschedule FAQ's. As per the FAQ it says that they will contact us through chat or over phone and there is also a chat option you can submit to connect. But no response on chat lines as it seems very busy and no call received . I thought I would end up in rescheduling the exam but they responded over chat after 50 mins. So be patient if this happens to you.

If you want to know the study material I used.
- Udemy Stephen's Course
- Jon Bonso’s practice tests on TutorialsDojo. All tests scored between 70-80%
- Spent 4 weeks studying 2-3 hours everyday without prior aws experience.

You can view it here: [Certificate Badge](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/b2c5e3e0-b546-4ef4-b75a-e55750920ae8?source=linked_in_profile) . I'm super excited to share with you my journey!

TL:DR: The long and short of it comes down to using  Adrian's amazing course found here: [https://learn.cantrill.io/](https://learn.cantrill.io/) ,  joined his [Slack Channel](https://techstudyslack.com/) and testing my knowledge using Jon Bonso's practice exams: [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/) , [TD Portal](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/) , try to get to passing grade to 80% on all 6 of the practice test to attempt the real exam. Also helpful:  [AWS On Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/aws) , [Hands on Serverless](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-framework/).

Longer story:

I want to explain why Adrian's course worked for me. As a web developer I learn and absorb things by doing them, and the way Adrian structure his course comes from his wealth of experience, and he recognizes that most people will remember the material better from doing it themselves.

So he structured his teaching style around presenting **real world problems** in the demos using this fictitious company Animals4Life, and we learn to help this global company with everything AWS has to offer, from getting a domain for the company with route53, scaling the site traffic with auto scaling and load balancing, or creating a 3 tiered VPC from scratch, **learning about encryption from cats and robots hatching a plot for world domination**. I could go on and on.

This is one of those course I can't wait to go to the next lesson, and you should give it a try to see what it's like! Additionally, Adrian is always on his [slack](https://techstudyslack.com/) channel helping people with anything AWS/cloud related, and you have a abundant amount of other people with more experiences to help you as well.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how exactly my journey went, here we go!

1. Started with acloudguru course on Udemy, content was really outdated and the demos simply did not work for me.
2. Found Adrian's course from a post he made detailing the topics covered in the new SAA-CO2 exam and the overwhelming positive things people said about his course and community.
3. Spending time everyday around 2 hours completing the course, joined his [slack](https://techstudyslack.com/) and lurked on it every single day reading other people's questions, occasionally asked some myself.
4. Started watching AWS on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/aws), and got interested in serverless architecture from Adrian's demo so I found another cool hands on [serverless course](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-framework/) and built this [auction house](http://bestsiteever.net/).
5. On completing Adrian's course, started with Jon Bonso's practice exams, failed every single one on first try.
6. Started taking notes on google docs during practice exams, detailing what I didn't understand, and read Jon's explanation on why an answer is more correct in one scenario. When back to Adrian's course on topics I thought I understood.
7. Started passing Bonso's tests and slowly started looking things up during the practice tests on things I didn't understand. Getting around 80% and minimal research.
8. Attempted the real exam and passed.

That's it folks, good luck and I hope whatever drove you to get this certificate will carry you forward, this is my first certificate and I hope my journey will help you achieve your goals this year. You got this!

j1aw8u,Passed the AWS SAA - C02 exam,"I just passed the SAA C02 yesterday and it was a crazy experience!

&amp;#x200B;

I took the proctored exam at home, since I don't want to go outside as much as possible. My schedule was 12 midnight on a Sunday. The verification process took a very long time and I was so close to giving up and cancelling the exam. I thought maybe something happened during the process and my exam was already revoked. Then suddenly, after waiting 40 minutes past my schedule the tech support sent me a chat saying that they were doing final verification before proceeding with the exam. 

&amp;#x200B;

Going through the exam, I was so nervous. I think I might have spent so much time reading and analyzing the first few questions before I got the momentum. I found myself reading the questions over and over again before I select my answer and move forward to the next question. As I move closer towards the end of the exam (I think I'm around question number 50 onward), suddenly I realized that I only had 15 minutes left! So I was thinking, I had to read and answer for an average of 1 minute per item! But the most intense part for me was on the last 5 minutes, and I still have 5 items left to answer! At this point, I just hurriedly read the questions trying my best to understand as fast as I can then pick answers that makes a lot of sense than the others. I ended up feeling that I failed this exam after I click that last ""finish"" or was it ""end the exam"" button. And if that wasn't torture enough, there was this 7 item (or was it 9?) survey questions that you had to answer before seeing if you passed or failed. I finally clicked on the last item of the survey and lo and behold. I saw the word PASSED. I raised both of my arms, with fists in the air, like a true champion.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I just wanted to share a bit of my story during my exam. If anyone's interested on which materials I used to study you can check here:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A Cloud Guru
2. Linux Academy
3. Jon Bonso's (Tutorials Dojo) Practice Exams

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say the first two gave me the basics of the AWS SAA in order for me to have a better understanding of the field. I am currently not working as an AWS SA or anything related to cloud, that's why I needed to learn everything from scratch. I wanted to learn AWS for the purpose of getting a job as an AWS SA. I hope I'd be able to land one soon!

Hi Redditors

My AWS certified Solutions Architect Professional Course has finally reached v1 [https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional) \- as with my other courses, it's not the cheapest, or the shortest. It's designed to teach you real world Pro level SA skills and help you to pass the SA Pro exam as a result.

I know we like numbers... so some key facts and figure

✅Designed for the current exam version .. and what I think the next major update will be adding 🙊

✅50 Hours of raw content, plus 20 hours extra to do the demo lessons

✅22 demos in total, 8 of those are advanced demos (video guided versions of the ones in my demo repo [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) which i release for free)

✅Section Quizzes designed to create knowledge anchors and aid in exam recall

✅2 full sets of practice exams included, 150 questions total

✅... better exam simulator is coming (the one i use is pretty meh) .. this will bring full graphical explanations along with the exam questions (I always have, and still do recommend by buddies over at [tutorialsdojo.com](https://tutorialsdojo.com) for extra practice questions)

✅Comes complete with custom designed learning aids (e.g. [https://imgur.com/gallery/pJ3wQLN](https://imgur.com/gallery/pJ3wQLN) ) high DPI/Resolution versions on GitHub

✅ Designed to accommodate students with color vision deficiency - concepts are communicated with shapes, colors and vocals

✅ All lessons have human professionally produced captions for hard of hearing students or anyone with English as a second language.

✅The course is designed so that it can be used immediately following my SA Associate course, no requirement to have done the other associate exams.

✅A 10k+ strong slack community dedicated to 'real' learning, not exam dumps. I'm super active on here and help anyone who needs 1-2-1 help as much as time and time zones allow.

One pretty important point is that I cover a lot of 'networking' in this course in more depth than you probably need - because I'm intending to have the advanced networking speciality course soonish and I want to prep my students.

j0xm7p,Wondering about my first at-home proctored exam (SAA-C02),"I've talken in-place proctored exams at Person, etc probably 40 times in the paat. Even ones that required photographs or biometrics. But this in-home thing? First of all I have barely used a Windows box although I acquired a cheap Lenovo notebook to use. What if my Internet drops? That's been happening lately? Can I reboot the modem or switch to a hotspot? Will that invalidate my exam? 

What is this about not using scratch paper or hearing other people? Does this mean I need to be in the house alone or just a closed room? I share an office with my girlfriend so I need to sanction just the kitchen table, going out in car or set up in a spare bedroom? 

How strict is all this? Thanks!",3,awscertifications,2020-10-13

j0rzl0,My thoughts after passing AWS-SAP on the 3rd attempt. (831/1000),"I've made a video to share my thoughts here: [https://youtu.be/89VPJcdisWA](https://youtu.be/89VPJcdisWA) for those that don't like reading long text. :)

&amp;#x200B;

To begin with, I didn't have any pressure to pass any AWS Cert exams, but I’ve been working on AWS day in and day out for the past six years, I feel I could give it a shot, more certificates for skills will not hurt my resume. So I took the first four exams - Cloud Practitioner, SAA, Developer Associate and SysOps exam. I passed all of them on the first attempt, giving me a huge confidence boost. I felt I am recognized by my skills and understanding of AWS. So naturally I feel I can take one step further to become certified at the professional level. I didn’t know what was ahead of me: if from zero to associate level was from floor ***one*** to floor ***five***, then from associate level to professional level was from floor ***five*** to floor ***thirty***. 

I had my first attempt to SA-Pro when my skill set was at floor fifteen, of course, it’d fail;

I had my second attempt thinking I should be at floor twenty nine or twenty eight, with a bit of luck, I could get the jewel of the crown, it turned out to be that I was only at floor twenty…

Before I took my final attempt, I worked really hard, it was the two consecutive failures that aroused my desire to fight - something that is not so easily attainable makes it more desirable and more attractive.

This exam is a grilling experience, but the learning is a great journey of exploration filled with fun and joy. I really loved it.

It is the difficulty of this exam that makes this certificate so valuable, and makes your hard earned skill set through passing this exam so marketable.

I missed out on my third one due to a schedule conflict: I had postponed this one twice, meaning I had rescheduled my original date and time twice on Pearson VUE, I didn’t see any warning or any popup alert while I did the rescheduling (maybe I didn't pay attention), only one week before the exam, I found I had another conflict that I cannot attend this exam on that day at all, I was just about to reschedule it to a future date again, only to have found out that they allow a maximum of two reschedules… so I was doomed… There’s nothing I could do but let this exam slip by…

So, for exam-takers, please plan accordingly and keep in mind that you could reschedule only TWICE with PearsonVUE..

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest challenge of preparing for this exam is: time, I have a full-time job which is pretty demanding, I have two kids that I’ll have to take care of which is lots of fun, but also very time consuming, they desire lots of your attention and energy, also, due to the COVID issue, we’ll have to work from home which makes everything a mess.

I often find myself interrupted by all sorts of things that you can imagine, while this exam is really long, lots of reading, oftentimes, I cannot go through 5 questions and being interrupted twice. How to stay focused? That’s another challenge.

For those that are in similar situations as me, I would suggest you carve out at least 30 mins a day, whatever time you can find, to squeeze that into your schedule, timebox it to be allocated just for studying and working on SA-Pro exam, for at least a month, of course, over the weekend, you could plan more time (YMMV based on your familiarity and experiences with AWS and architecting in general).

You want to keep the momentum, keep it up until you pass the finish line.

I thought about giving up multiple times, one reason is that it’s really difficult, I mean this exam itself, the other is, I sometimes often question myself what’s the point of even passing it? Nobody is asking me to do so, or is it worth spending so much time and effort doing this? To be honest, I stopped studying for this a few times along the way, but eventually, what overcame me was one scene: I desire the minute when I see the screen shows:”Congratulations, you passed!” I vividly remember those times when I passed those first four AWS exams and the joy and happiness was beyond description, at that one moment, you know all your effort and hard work do pay off.

And only if you have climbed up to that point, you wouldn’t realize how beautiful the view is from that height, what kind of paths you’ll be able to see at that height. I totally agree that passing this highly sought after certificate exam certainly opens a lot of opportunities for me, actually, I just realized lots of job descriptions clearly listed out these certifications and your passing of them kind of automatically makes you an authority in this field, of course I know there are many other things, like your technical experiences, your communication skills, your technical influence, etc. but this certification certainly gives you a huge advantage.

I wouldn’t hesitate to sit down, study hard for it and pass it!

Now, in retrospect, I do feel I have grown a lot after studying and passing this exam, technically, this exam gives me a full overview of AWS, covering the great width and depth of AWS technologies, significantly boosted my confidence when it comes to architecting on top of AWS or just in general talking about AWS or scoping out a highly available and scalable system.

&amp;#x200B;

After passing SA-Pro, you know other exams will be easier, because clearly you felt you were going uphill, once you are up to the utmost point, other hills seem smaller.

In fact, with the momentum after passing AWS-SAP, I passed AWS-DevOps Professional a few days later.

About how I prepared and studied for this exam:

I mainly relied on WhizLabs: [https://www.whizlabs.com/](https://www.whizlabs.com/) \+ my own experiences building and running things on AWS for the past six years.

1. try the official practice exams on AWS: [https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-pro/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Professional\_Sample-Questions.pdf](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-pro/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Professional_Sample-Questions.pdf) which will give you a good idea of where you are in terms for passing this exam;
2. Use the practice exams that Whizlabs has to offer:
   1. It’s a soul crushing experience, you can see none of my practice exams had a passing score. (I've made a video here: [https://youtu.be/89VPJcdisWA](https://youtu.be/89VPJcdisWA) )they are very key to get yourself ramped up, get yourself in that mood, to be familiar with the questions and the terms, to be used to so many questions, one after another, to get yourself seated in a room for three hours, practice that, it’s a skill, it requires deliberate practice to be there, if you don’t practice it before the exam, then you are using the exam to practice. :)
   2. The reason I'm a big fan of WhizLabs are multi-fold:
      1. you can pause your practice exam if you are interrupted by something else, this is a simple feature yet I'm so in love with, because you'll find it very rare to be able to complete one practice exam in one session without being distracted. This feature could help you save your progress so far and quickly pick up where you left off later on.
      2. it has a detailed explanation for each question, including why a certain choice is right or wrong, which enables you to self-study;
      3. they have a cool lab which I heard is very useful but I didn't get time to try it.
3. open up your own AWS console and play around with an AWS service that you don't know of, get used to is, your hands-on experiences create the most long lasting memory;
4. refer to official AWS white papers and documentation, they are the authority, but it's a bit tedious and difficult to read since they are usually very long and comprehensive.",47,awscertifications,2020-10-13

1) Many thanks to the community members who have shared the experience and advices.

2) Study materials:

2.1 ) AWS Certified Solutions Architect Study Guide Associate SAA-C01 Exam, By Ben Piper.

Read it for 3 times. The contents are a bit outdated and the review question style is different from actual test. To me, it's a good book to get started the journey. 

2.2) Stephane Maarek online course. Awesome, watched for 3 times. I like the hand-on, it helps me to understand the various AWS services in his course. 

2.3) Practice Exams by Jon Bonso. Needless to say, it’s a must to have. 

2.4) SAA-C02 online videos in YouTube from Neal Davis. I like his style. 

2.5) AWS FAQs

2.6) AWS Cheat Sheets from Tutorials Dojo.

2.7) My personal notes of the important points, collected from all channels. I read it once in a while and the day before the test.

3) Overall, it took me 4 months to prepare. 

4) I have full time IT job, ZERO cloud experience.

5) I Spent 4 weekends to complete 6 sets of Jon Bonso's timed mode practice exam, started from one month before the test, with scores of 87%, 84%, 84%, 93%, 81%, 89%. I think it's more difficult than the actual test, my two cents. 

6) Test result was sent to me 6 hours after the end of the test. The score is 955.",19,awscertifications,2020-10-13

j0gf7v,My experience passing the AWS SAA-C02 with various resources,"**TLDR: Maarek's course: 4, Adrian Cantrill's course: 5+**

Hi everyone, I've been a silent follower of this group for the past couple of months but simply as a lurker. Now that I've taken and passed the SAA-C02, I would like to contribute to what made that possible. First, a huge debt of gratitude to this group. It's a great supportive community and an essential resource to fall back on for guidance from people who have paved the path of certification before us.

So, I actually started studying for the SAA-C02 before the exam officially switched to the C02 version. I initially looked into ACG as a source, started their course and half-way through the course, the announcement of the new C02 came out. So, I bailed on the ACG course since it was all C01 and they had no real timeline on updates. From there, I went on Udemy and found Maarek's course. But, at that time, Maarek's course also only had C01 material, but hearing all the good things about his course from here made me continue on that path and he slowly updated the course with new C02 material. But, the updates came when I was nearing the end of his course. Towards the end of that course, even though new material was being added, I just didn't feel comfortable taking an exam from 1 resource and that is when I learned about Adrian Cantrill's course from this group.

I had no idea who Adrian Cantrill was since he's not on Udemy. But, even with the glowing reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. It was interesting to me that Adrian used to run ACG's original SAA-C01 course, so with ACG's rep, that was promising. Let me tell you, Adrian's course was a HUGE help in solidifying concepts. It was the best decision I made on this path. I can say this as I have experience with other courses. So, one thing I want to get out of the way is that you can pass the exam with either Maarek's course (now that it is updated) or with Adrian's course (which launched with mostly updated content from the start). But, there are a few differences between the courses that merit acknowledgement.

&amp;#x200B;

* The production quality of Adrian's course is professional level. The audio level is consistent from start to finish with his course. There is no volume adjustments needed at all. Maarek's course doesn't have this same level of production quality. He has recorded videos for various certs and re-uses videos across courses, which in itself is not a problem - anyone would do the same. But, the audio levels are all over the place. One minute you have the volume on medium, the next high.
* The level of support between the two courses is a major differentiating factor. Udemy has a built in Q&amp;A section to ask for help. With Maarek's course, he uses TA's to answer questions, but from my experience, the promptness of getting a reply has been haphazard to the point of sometimes not getting a reply at all. With Adrian's course, you get access to his Slack channel, discourse forum, his blog, and the usual social platforms. Almost every time, Adrian or someone from his community on the Slack channel has come through in either minutes or within 24 hours (I am in the US and Adrian is in Australia). No TAs, Adrian himself is the one tackling our questions. I honestly don't know how he does it given that he's creating new courses and taking care of answering his student's questions. If he goes the TA route at some point, I wouldn't hold that against him, as long as the same level of promptness is given.
* With Maarek's course, you really mostly learn about the services to pass an exam. There are some ""projects"" he uses, but they're mostly already setup and he walks you through how each piece of the AWS puzzle was put together to make the end product. Which on its own is not bad at all. I thought that was really cool actually. But, with Adrian's course, you are working on a real-world project from start to finish, continuously improving on it. There's no hand-waving, you're actually creating the infrastructure with Adrian. Adrian's course is longer because of it, so if you have the time and value learning AWS for practical use at a job, the time spent is well worth it. The certification is a byproduct of real-world AWS use.
* The pace of Maarek's course is fast. Speeding up videos could be something you prefer. For me personally, I had his course on 1.25x and no more, many times I had to go back to 1x, and many other times I had to rewatch sections because he can sometimes go quickly through the AWS console UI and I'm very particular of understanding the what, why, where, and how if I'm going to dedicate my time to learn something. With Adrian's course, he is methodical in repeating key points of interest for the exam to let it sink in. He even goes to the point of telling you that you need to know this or that for the exam. It gets slow sometimes because when you're nearing the end of his course, you just want to finish it to take the exam because you feel ready. That is a mistake. LOL. I thought that way and after seeing some questions from other students in the Slack channel, I was like oh shit, I don't know the answer to that myself. I went back to review and sure enough the information is there in the course. Take your time, appreciate the slower pace of Adrian's course and it will pay dividends. I sped up his course on things I had a firm grasp on and kept it at 1x on things I really needed to understand further. I especially kept things at 1x when going back over certain sections to review and catch little details I may have missed the first time.
* Adrian uses animation in his slides and uses really good diagrams to show you how each action creates links in the infrastructure. It might be a small point, but I felt this was KEY to letting concepts sink in. I'm a visual learner and to see how routes, links, connections work in an animated way kept me engaged and my interest level high. When you're 15 hours into study, these kind of details matter. All his diagrams are created by him, they're not copy/pasted diagrams from AWS.

One thing I want to clarify is that going through Maarek's course and then Adrian's course didn't result in me finding Adrian's course more thorough because I had a foundation from Maarek's course. The longer you take to study for this certification without practical use of AWS, the easier it is to forget the finer details. You might remember that there are only 5,000 IAM users per AWS account, but you'll forget whether to use a Gateway endpoint or an Interface endpoint to connect to DynamoDB privately. You'll forget that you use a prefix list in the route table to represent the list of private IPs for S3 or DynamoDB with a Gateway endpoint. I forgot a ton of stuff because of the amount of time I took.

Maarek's course will teach you what you need to pass the exam, don't get me wrong. Just take the exam after finishing either course. Don't wait. It's up to you to decide why you're studying and putting in the hard work of getting certified, which separates the two courses in my opinion. For me, I found a level of polish in Adrian's course and going through a project was a great way to learn real-world AWS and pass the certification. Even after passing, I will go back over Adrian's course because AWS is so vast, you will inevitably forget things or miss things if you're not using AWS day in day out.

In conclusion, if you have the time, take both courses for the reinforcement. If you're short on time and just want to pass the exam, take Maarek's course. But, if you have the mindset that you're going to put in the time and hard work to learn something in the hopes of landing a job or getting a promotion and you want a professional level course, take Adrian's course. You'll get real-world knowledge and a certification. If Adrian taught this course as a consultant to companies, he would go to the bank with bags of money. I'm not kidding. LOL.

If anyone has any other questions, feel free to message me.

\[EDIT\]

I took one Jon Bonso test one hour before my actual exam this month. I took it because of the reviews on this sub. But, obviously, it's not needed if you really know your shit - or atleast know enough to cross 720. I recommend taking his practice tests if you're not sure how well you know the AWS material from either course. But, if you study maniacally and know the material, a test is not going to give you extra knowledge, it only helps you expose gaps in your knowledge. So, it all depends on your comfort level, your study habits, etc. I took copious notes going through both courses so I could quickly have my notes to go over without going through the videos at the last minute.",47,awscertifications,2020-10-13

j0cf2s,Passed AWS Solutions Architect - Professional,"Thanks for all the community members who shared your experience here. It helped a lot during the course of my preparation. 

I used Jon Bonso exams and Stephen Mareeks course. I also used some free sources out there. I did my associate exam in January and used Jon’s exams for that aswell. That’s the best practice test I took for any certification. Questions and explanations filled lot of gaps in my knowledge. They covered the “in between the lines” meaning. However I personally felt professional test needs a bit of improvement. May be the course I had is a bit old now or that’s how it has to be I am not sure. Stephen mareek’s course also helped a lot. He did the best work in dumbing down the explanations and keep the videos crisp. I can’t say enough good things about both the courses. All the reviews out there is a testament of how much effort they put in these courses. I thank them for all the time and effort they have put in the courses.

Exam experience was new as its my first exam from home. I had to wait for almost 30mins in the virtual lobby. your workspace would be inspected. It’s hard to write the exam without a scratch paper and pen. You do have a MS Paint kinda tool but it’s weird to use. When the exam started it’s as usual. You will be recorded throughout the exam. I had lot of questions on following: AWS Organization , Migration Technologies from on prem to AWS , R53 routing,  Network issue troubleshooting, Interpreting IAM policies, Few AWS cli questions , OPS Works, SSM. Felt basic understanding of organization was not enough. Surprisingly not many questions on security related services. 

Most important thing was time management which I didn’t do a good job at. Spent lot of time on First 30 questions which were comparatively hard and I spent lot of time there instead of coming back to them at the end. Later part of the questions were a bit easier. By the time I reached the end I dint have time at all and I have to rush through last 10 questions in under 5 minutes. All in all I felt I could have done better if I managed time better.",21,awscertifications,2020-10-13

j08wi2,Just Passed the SysOps Administrator exam today! I failed last year though.,"I retook the SysOps Administrator exam this morning and passed! I wanted to provide a bit of encouragement for anyone that might have failed.

Last November I took the exam and failed, I was really discouraged from the whole experience since I had bought the Jon Bonso exams and Stephan’s course on Udemy. I spent about a month studying, and had prior experience with AWS, so I thought I was ready.

But I wasn’t last November. Even though I had failed, I worked with AWS fairly regularly at my job and over the past year I was put on a project that is heavily utilizing AWS to host a number of websites.

I can honestly say the BEST preparation for this exam, in my opinion, is work experience or hands on practice with the various services that are covered. I passed the exam this morning after spending about a week of in depth studying (that mostly involved reviewing Stephan’s videos on services I was weak on, and doing Bonso’s test and reviewing the questions I got wrong). 


Don’t give up y’all, you’re smarter than you realize. You may just need that extra bit of experience to tie all the concepts together and make sense of the services and how they work.

    B. An SNS topic
    C. RDS storage
    D. Application Load Balancer
    
    Correct answer is C.
    Explanation:
    RDS storage can be increased in size but not decreased, fitting the definition of a scalable resource.

and this one

    2. Which of the following defines the term scalability?
    
    A. The ability of a system to decrease resources to accommodate decreased demand
    B. The ability of a system to increase and decrease resources allocated to match demand
    C. The ability of a system to maintain the same resources, regardless of changes in demand
    D. The ability of a system to increase resources to accommodate increased demand
    
    Correct answer is D.
    Explanation: Scalable systems are able to increase but not decrease resources. An example of this is RDS storage.

In the first question DynamoDB table is also scalable.

In the second question answer B seems to be the correct one (this is how auto-scaling works).

j04xvw,Tips from my experience passing all the Associate level exams in 6 weeks,"Hi everyone,  


So I just finished the notoriously *tricky* SysOps exam yesterday evening and I'm shifting my AWS cert journey into low gear now. I decided to get the Associate level certs to bolster my career standing - I don't really see a point in rushing to get anymore especially since I don't have production AWS experience. I will continue to learn but just not as intensely as I have been these past 6 weeks.

I actually paused for about 2 weeks after the SAA because I was deciding whether it'd be worth it to continue, so it's doable in even 1 month I would say.  


My scores for SAA, DVA, and SOA are: 754, 904 and 894 respectively.  


For those that are studying the certifications, I wanted to share some of my experiences learning in general and studying for AWS specifically:  


* **You have to learn to be honest with yourself.** Everything occurs in the real world. You can't risk deluding yourself with your imagination and thinking your delusions will become real. I have seen people actually attempt these certs without studying, without even having any IT experience. That's a waste of time, money, and will hurt your confidence.
* **Be patient.** This goes back to being honest with yourself but is more specific. Things in the real world take time. Literally nothing is instantaneous. 
* **Work hard.** This is actually very hard for a lot of people to realize - I think especially if you're used to a 9 to 5 job. When you see people that are wildly successful, your ego will probably pass it off as sheer luck, shady dealings, etc. People work harder than you think. There are musicians that go days without sleeping in the studio, Elon Musk works on avg 80 hours a week, etc. Someone who studies 1 hour a day isn't going to be as successful as the one that spends all their ""free time"" achieving their goals. You don't have to treat yourself everyday to leisure - sacrifice maybe a week or two to just focus on your goals and see how much you can get accomplished. For these exams, I studied maybe 6-8 hours a day on average but I have done 12 hour days. I would rather reach my goals sooner and relax after. That also helps to keep your mind clear of too many *backburner* goals. 
* **Learn to learn.** Yes, you can actually learn learning techniques and the fundamentals of how we learn. For the most part, humans are visual learners. I feel lucky to have learnt how to learn years ago. I have never once failed an exam and I have never taken notes on a subject. I just play everything out in my head, use analogies, and a little rote method sometimes. Learning with the intent to teach (even if you don't end up teaching) helps a lot too.
* **Direct experience.** Get into the AWS console and actually play with it. Click every dropdown, read every info icon, etc. Direct experience helps knowledge anchor because that experience now has an actual  time/space reference and not just a thought.

&amp;#x200B;

A few tips quick tips when it comes to studying:

* Sleep well.
* Eat well.
* Exercise.
* Set balanced goals: realistic, yet also challenging.
* You will know that you're prepared to challenge your knowledge (write exam) when you genuinely start to feel like the material is no longer challenging and it gets harder to keep studying (due to boredom?).
* \*I noticed that I pay better attention to video content when I speed it up. I'm guessing it's adrenaline or the fear or missing information that causes that.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically, when it comes to AWS, I would advise you to actually learn the basic technologies beforehand. For example, I already dealt with containers, orchestration, config management, reverse proxies, provisioning, etc before ECS, EKS, OpsWorks, ELB, etc. AWS is mainly just a layer of abstraction on top of tech that already exists. 

From my experience, AWS exams don't try to trick you. When you know your stuff, the answer will be come clear. I barely passed SAA and a lot of choices were grey to me - that's because I wasn't fully prepared, I wasn't completely ready when I took the exam. A lot of people say SOA is tricky but it was ridiculously easy for me - maybe even more than the DVA exam. That's because by the time I was ending my studies for SOA, I just knew how everything worked.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of resources, I used everything that everyone else mentions here: Stephane Maarek for SAA, Linux Academy for all 3, and the Bonzo exams. ACG courses honestly added no value to my studies. I would go as far as to say the Bonzo exams are essential. If you are scoring above 85% on the exams, then it's a good indicator that you're ready. Read the explanations for both correct and incorrect answers. 

Special mention to Adrian Cantrill. His LA course for SAA is incredible. He's basically the perfect instructor - delivery, content, pace, etc. I regard him as currently the best course instructor. 

&amp;#x200B;

When taking the exam, if you start to feel overwhelmed, try stopping and close your eyes while just taking 30-40 deep breathes. That technique helped me to clear my head and continue on.

Continue to support each other. I wish you all the best!",61,awscertifications,2020-10-13

izr8py,Just passed the AWS SAA-CO2 Exam!,"Yes! Just passed the exam today. I used Stephane Maarek's course via Udemy and went from beginning to end over 30 days (used Apple TV -&gt; Udemy app and watched while on treadmill, did 30% of labs as I had  experience). I really enjoyed Stephane's course and the Udemy app is great. 

I did his practice exams but then I bought Adrian Cantrill's course which has much more depth and was very helpful to really grasp the concepts for the exam, I would say this is a must. But I am happy I did Stephane's course first to have context then go in detail with Adrian. The way Stephane pronounces ""bucket"" and how Adrian pronounces ""cache"" makes me giggle to this day, I am a silly Americano.

I bought Jon Bonso's course via Udemy and via Tutorial Dojo and they were very, very helpful. I did prefer the TD tests vs. Udemy as they seem fresher (prob my imagination). I added in Neal Davis's new eBook via Kindle and the last two weeks I just drilled test questions and went back to Adrian's course for the questions I missed.

The test seemed to hit everything but I would say AWS DataSync, Storage Gateway, Lambda, API Gateway, VPC, FSx, ASG, Aurora, Glacier, tons of NAT Gateway and VPC endpoints plus some easy but tricky ones. I am waiting on my score but I had over 20 minutes left to review my flagged questions before finishing.

If I knew the answer I clicked it and moved on, if not then I would answer it, flag it and visit it after. I DID have a button to check for incomplete answers (meaning I could confirm if I only had selected one answer when two were required). This gave me some peace of mind. 

Today is my cake day because I created a new account (previous one was identifiable).

My concern is about ""All Linux/Unix based Operating Systems are strictly prohibited."" Why? AWS is platform agnostic so why not ensure that the certification partners are the same as well? In these times when remote exams are preferred more platforms should be included. I had to go to the testing center due to unavailability of a secure platform such as Linux. The first platform they should support is ami 2.

iwui7m,"Passed My SAA-C02 After 2nd Attempt! - Then Ran To Get Phone To Take Picture Of ""Passed"" Screen Before Realizing I Was Still Testing","So yea the title pretty much says it all. I just passed my SAA-C02 exam about 2 hours ago. I am a little hesitant to post my success so quickly because I did something I read on another reddit post without realizing what I was doing and I don't know if it will disqualifying me from passing or not, hopefully not. After the exam when I finished my survey when the screen comes up that says either ""Passed"" or ""Failed"" and I read ""Passed"", I immediately ran out of the room screaming I passed to my wife, grabbed my phone to run back in to take a picture to post of course and realized I was still being recorded. I threw my phone and clicked end exam. I do remember someone else doing this I read about and I cant remember if it ended well for them or not. I am hoping it will all be good and if they review the video its clear to see I'm done testing and it was all done out of excitement.

It was an amazing journey and I self studied for about 3 months and the best feeling is doing it for myself, self motivated. I at first used the Acloudguru course from udemy and a few practice exams of Jon Bonso i also got off Udemy with my original exam scheduled for August 1st. I took that exam and scored a 684. During that exam I ran across a few subjects that I was not familiar with and just fell short. I tried to blame my study sources for not being up to date enough for the new version of the test but after reflecting it just seems like I wasn't taking the right approach. After my first fail i was discouraged at first but had energy to want to study all the subjects that were unfamiliar to me and the urge to study and retake soon while everything is still fresh in my brain. After the first fail, while doing research on the majority of the subjects not covered in my ACloudGuru course, I came across digitalcloud training. Almost every subject that wasn't covered in my ACG course was covered by Neal in his digitalcloud training course. Since I failed once and felt like i needed another source of study material I went ahead and purchases Neals full course for the SAA-C02. My favorite part was his tests on it. I found his videos less captivating then ACG but much more informative and in depth and covered important parts that are needed for understanding the cloud. I also found the he explained things more thoroughly.

The last week also I restudied my Jon Bonso tests I had purchased from Udemy on my first go around. Ill be honest when I originally purchased that set of tests i did not realize how valuable some of the questions in there were. I read multiple times on this reddit thread about the Jon Bonso tests for the SAA-C02 version of the exam. After reading about it so much i went to Udemy to purchase it and realized it was the exams I already purchased and neglected to study as much as i should have. I would not recommend using the ACG course tests. The exams I took were much more relatable to the tests I took on DigitalCloud from Neal or the Jon Bonso tests.

As far as things to study I noticed a lot  on EC2, S3, VPC's &amp; a lot on DynamoDB &amp; Advanced DynamoDB features. A decent amount on migrating services. A lot of lambda and how it is used with other services. Also a good amount on CloudFront and CDN. Ultimately it was a fun test but it was still difficult for me 2nd time around. I am not working in AWS everything I've done has been for fun thus far as for as AWS goes. I do work in the tech field and i feel for someone with decent technical knowledge this certificate is obtainable in 3 - 6 months depending on your skill level. Even less if you are more experienced or familiar with different IT aspects, and potentially longer for those very fresh in it. Passing is possible you just have to put the work in.

Thanks for reading my post and ill update if I get disqualified or something for running out of the room after I passed to grab my phone to take a picture.

I used Stephane Maalek's Udemy course and Jon Bonso's practice exams, which were both great. I felt like the test was easier than Bonso's practice tests, the questions were definitely less wordy. Still the exam was challenging and required me to really think and to take some educated guesses. For most of the questions I was able to immediately eliminate two of the four possible answers and then just focus on the remaining two. When I finished I still had about 50 minutes left. Also I didn't flag any questions, I just went through them one by one and didn't skip any for later.

Also I have a question, I know that you don't get your exact results back immediately, but is it normal for the paper that the proctor gives you to not say ""pass"" or ""fail""? I took the test at a center and after I got up from my desk and went to the proctor he gave me a paper that just says ""Thank you for taking the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Exam"".

ivwgsc,Acloudguru are scamming people. Secretly removed Linuxacademy courses and replaced it with their inferior products.,"**Acloudguru is scamming people and going back on their promise.**

When Acloudguru took over LinuxAcademy they assured us that we will have access to both catalog of courses. This was a lie.

I paid for Linuxacademy yearly subscription to access their AWS Architect Pro and Devops Pro courses. 

**When I logged in a few days ago I found out that ACG removed 50 hour Aws Architect Pro Linuxacademy course by Adrian Cantrill and replaced it with their ACG inferior 14 hour course by Scott Pelter**

**ACG removed 32 hour Devops Pro course and replaced it with their garbage 6 hour course. **In actuality it’s only 4 hours!! Because they sneakily marked each section quiz as 4 hours long and added it to course total.**

This is clearly not what I and other Linuxacademy members paid for. We would like the content that we paid for. Ryan Kroonenburg should be ashamed of himself for scamming people.

I opened a ticket and was told by ACG rep that if I didn’t watch any video from Linuxacademy AWS Pro courses before then I won’t have access to them. Which is completely the opposite of what we were told when ACG took over.

They are slowly replacing all LinuxAcademy courses with shorter, vomit inducing ACG products. 

**Also they sneakily inflate course length by making their quizzes as 4 hour long each.** For example there are 6 quiz for AWS Devops Pro exam. So 6 x 4 is 24 hours. **The total length of AWS Devops pro course advertised by ACG is 27 hours. So there is only 3 hours of content. No really, go check!**

Linux academy had such great courses and content. Acloudguru is completely destroying all of its credibility and scamming people on top of it. I advise not to get any subscription with them.

I’m a 2nd year student who recently switched majors into CS. I actually wanted to major in CS but I was accepted into my university for something completely different so I worked hard to do the requirements in order to switch.

Since the switch (a couple days ago) I’ve been much happier and a lot more productive. I remembered how I was actually working towards the Cloud Practitioner cert before even going into Uni but stopped because I was giving the other major (Twas in the medical field) a chance.

Now I’m getting back into AWS, but after looking at reddit I was wondering if CP was worth it. I thought it would give me some brownie points to land an internship and obviously just for me to personally learn the AWS Cloud since I have no knowledge of it really and because I’m genuinely interested in the subject. 

Of course this is all just a first step for me. I’m going to continue on to get other certs if I do decide to get this one. But should I just learn the fundamentals and go for the Developer Association cert and skip Cloud Practitioner?? $100 is a lot of money for any college student, especially for myself, and instead of wasting it on something else I really want to do something to not only give me knowledge and a resume boost, but something I could be proud of investing in.

Also u/Julie_ACloudGuru also indicated that she will be escalating to her manager to get some exposure to this issue.


**UPDATE 9/19/20: I received a response from [u/Julie\_ACloudGuru](https://www.reddit.com/u/Julie_ACloudGuru/) in the [r/acloudguru](https://www.reddit.com/r/acloudguru/) subreddit in which she said - ""*We are still adding LA courses. I’m almost finished with the updated CSA course and I’m sure we are adding others too. We have a lot of new processes but we have great content coming. I hope you will stick with us!""*

I don't think this addressed my concern at all and I don't know if she didn't understand my post or was purposely responding with ""marketing talk"". I responded back to her to clarify.

I also reached out directly to Sam and Ryan Kroonenburg on LinkedIn and will post an update based on their response.",137,awscertifications,2020-10-13

iv7cq3,SAA-C02 Preparation-How do you ensure you are prepared enough for the exam even after doing practice exams?,"So,  I followed Stephane Maarek's SAA course and I have been preparing for about a month now. After going through the course, I did Stephane's practice exams and Jon Bosco's practice exams. My scores on the JB practice tests where 86%,80%,83%,87%,78% and 73% on the 1st attempt for JB's and I scored above 80% for Stephane's also.

I assume it's good practice to score 90% on those tests provided by JB. But I'm concerned about memorising the tests which would be a huge hinderance. How do  you verify you are prepared enough for the exam ?

I'm currently reviewing the question papers including all correct and incorrect questions and I'm thinking for the rest of the week, I will just go through pdf provided by Stephane and JB's cheat sheets. Is there some other preparation pattern I should follow for the next 1 week. I have booked exam on September 26th and I''m still not sure if I have done enough preparation.",6,awscertifications,2020-10-13

iv639x,From zero to hero in less than 6 months,"6 months ago I had literally NO IT experience, only basic computer knowledge. Someone on Reddit told me about AWS, and the career opportunities available, so I decided to try to learn it and get certified. I am a high school dropout and a felon, all I have ever done is back breaking labor. I saw this as a potential way out. 

I just looked in my posting history and I saw that 2 months ago I made a post here when I passed the SAA, my first AWS cert. As of last night I have all 3 associate level certs, and just passed the Solutions Architect Professional exam. All while working 50+ hours a week.

I started my journey by taking the CCP course from Neil Davis. I skipped taking the CCP test and went straight into Stephane Maarek's SAA course. From there I have used his courses for each other cert, as well as the practice tests from Jon Bondo at TD. 

The hardest cert for me was the first one, the SAA. Everything I was learning was brand new to me and I found that I had to constantly pause the course to look up videos about linux she'll commands, networking terms, etc. I took copious notes (which I would not do again) and a 5 minute video module would take me 20 minutes to get through. 

After the SAA I went through the other 2 associate certs quickly, about 2 or 3 weeks each. With these I took very few notes, I watched most of the video modules at 1.25-1.5x speed, and I just followed along on the hands on labs instead of doing them. 

With the SAP I went through the video course fairly quickly, but have spent the last 2 weeks taking practice tests and doing self study with the white papers, aws blogs, etc. I found that the practice test from tutorials dojo were invaluable for the associate exams, but the quality wasn't as high for the SAP, particularly the explanations. I would get confused trying to understand why the correct answer was the right choice, and the explanation at the bottom would usually give very little reason why it was, and there would be a link to a cheat sheet. Still, I wouldn't have passed the SAP without them.

The SAP test itself was brutal. The questions are complicated and require you to pick out minuet details. They also tended to reference things I had no idea about. The length and complexity of the questions, combine with the time limit made it a grueling slog to the finish line. When I had 10 questions left the timer (which starts with 3 hours) was down to 12 minutes. For the last 10 or so questions I had to just skim the question/answers and pick what I thought was right. When I answered the last question, I had less than 30 seconds remaining. 

I was truly shocked when I saw that I passed. I haven't gotten my score back yet, but there is no way it is above 800. I thought for sure I had failed while I was doing the end of test survey. 

Now I'm not sure where to go from here, for multiple reasons. I am not sure which certs to go for next. I would go for DevOps but I don't know any programming languages so it seems pointless. Do I go for a specialty AWS cert like security or do I start tackling Azure. I'm really not sure and I am open to suggestions. I also need to get my name out there to recruiters to try to get someone to give me a shot. I don't have a LinkedIn profile, though I need to make one. I don't know what other channels are out there for finding employment, but I will be doing my research. I would start posting on freelance sites, but where I have no experience I think I would have a hard time servicing the needs of customers without having a team to help guide me a little. 

I don't expect that having these certs will make it so that I can just stroll into any cloud job, but I am hoping that if I apply the same drive and persistence to employment as I did to achieving these certs, than I will find someone who will give me a shot. I just know that having no previous experience, along with the fact that I am a high school dropout and a felon will be a serious roadblock. 

So I just wanted to tell everyone my story so far. I hope it helps others and inspires people in a similar position to me.

If anyone has any advice on how to proceed from here, please let me know.",88,awscertifications,2020-10-13
iv5x9r,Who is writing the horrible questions to the AWS Certification Exams?,"I was prepping for my upcoming AWS Solutions Architect (Associate) exam and I was going through the practice questions on the AWS website:  
[https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate\_Sample-Questions.pdf](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Sample-Questions.pdf)

I can't believe how bad some of the wording is. If it's this bad on the exam, I'm going to fail due to being too smart. Can anyone else validate that I'm not just an idiot and that the questions need to be written better?  


 9) A company needs to maintain access logs for a minimum of 5 years due to regulatory requirements. The data is rarely accessed once stored, but must be accessible with one day’s notice if it is needed. What is the MOST cost-effective data storage solution that meets these requirements? 

A) Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage and delete the objects after 5 years using a lifecycle rule. 

B) Store the data in Amazon S3 Standard storage and transition to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days using a lifecycle rule. 

C) Store the data in logs using Amazon CloudWatch Logs and set the retention period to 5 years. 

D) Store the data in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage and delete the objects after 5 years using a lifecycle rule. 

\--

The answer key says A is the right answer. I argue that B is actually the correct answer. Although Glacier Deep Archive is cheaper than Glacier, the question says data must be kept a MINIMUM of five years...so why would you delete it immediately after 5 years? Shouldn't the question say a MAXIMUM of five years? 

\--

 10) A company uses Reserved Instances to run its data-processing workload. The nightly job typically takes 7 hours to run and must finish within a 10-hour time window. The company anticipates temporary increases in demand at the end of each month that will cause the job to run over the time limit with the capacity of the current resources. Once started, the processing job cannot be interrupted before completion. The company wants to implement a solution that would allow it to provide increased capacity as cost-effectively as possible. What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this? 

A) Deploy On-Demand Instances during periods of high demand. 

B) Create a second Amazon EC2 reservation for additional instances. 

C) Deploy Spot Instances during periods of high demand. 

D) Increase the instance size of the instances in the Amazon EC2 reservation to support the increased workload. 

\--

The answer key says A is the right answer. I argue D is the correct answer. The question specifically asks for jobs that will suddenly take longer to run at the end of the month due to them being more strenuous. They are talking about one job being more strenuous, and not multiple jobs. This is clearly answered by having a more powerful instance, meaning D would be the correct answer. A is only correct if there are more jobs taking place to run on each individual server.

I  am training myself to become a sufficient Data Scientist (second year of my Master) and I'm thinking about expanding into Cloud Computing for better employment chances when graduating.

* I heard that beginners should be looking at the **AWS Solution Architect Certificate,** but the more I look into it, the more I realize it is not for me but rather for IT or Developers.
* I found on the AWS website [this pathway](https://aws.amazon.com/training/path-data-analytics/) that is suitable for me because it is for Data Analytics, and I also found [a helpful guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/hsag0q/just_passed_the_aws_data_analytics_specialty_cert/) on this subreddit as well by u/ObaafqXzzlrkq . The only problem is that he seems to have prior knowledge before going into this path so I hesitate a little bit about this also.

I am hoping that with my consulting experience and a certificate, I can get my foot in the door. Has anyone successfully made a career change similar to mine? Is it a bit of a pipe dream to go directly into a solutions architect position with just consulting experience and an AWS certificate? If so, where is a good place to start?",26,awscertifications,2020-10-13

itsycj,What is Coming Soon to AWS Certifications?,"  **New and updated special exam guide**

The AWS certificate provides testing guides to help candidates prepare for the test. Each test manual contains a statement of content and information relevant to the certification. Before the trial period, we share test guides to obtain new certificates and update test releases. Updating the AWS Certificate verifies that our certificates are valid for current AWS services and best practices.

*There are currently no new testing guides.*

**Current pilot exam**

AWS certification follows a rigorous process to create industry-recognized exams and credentials. The test period for new tests and new test versions allows the performance of the test item to be checked before it is used in a direct test.

Candidates who pass the beta test will receive an applicable AWS certificate. Beta testing is offered at 50% above standard test prices, and results are available within 90 days of the end of the test period.

*No beta tests are currently available.*",0,awscertifications,2020-10-13
itns31,Data warehousing in AWS practical approach,"I am into data warehousing since past 10 years but very new to AWS environment. I have couple of questions related to DW in AWS. 

* I started learning Redshift (I do have very good knowledge in SQL Server &amp; MySQL). Do I have to learn more databases in AWS to work in data warehousing projects?

* I have worked on SSIS and Talend, I know that columnar usually prefer ELT but based on my experience (project specific), I found that ETL help us to reduce data size, faster processing of data (in reporting) &amp; clean data. Ex: I can skip rows with incorrect data types, or apply business rule to process limited data (ex: my text file may contain data from multiple region but I have to load only USA related data). How big organizations with millions of rows do ETL on cloud? 
I can think up of two approach:
1: Use Glue 
2: Use EC2 instance, use talend there and take source as S3 and destination as Redshift 

Is there any other way to do it? 

* How big organization handle agile development? I mean, let say I have developed a glue job in test environment. Now, in production my S3 folder could be different &amp; many things could be different. Usually, SSIS/Talend provides a deployment method with parametrization. How agile development happens in enterprise level projects? 

* After Googling for long, I couldn't find a realistic DW implementaion discussed online about how companies use Redshift (or other AWS databases?) for DW. All I can see is AWS white paper which has tons of services involved even for a simple task. I personally think that using 7-15 services to develop a DW architecture is not a smart solution but I can be horribly wrong because I am novice in AWS. If you have worked on DW on AWS, can you please help me know how data processing happens on AWS?
Ex: Storage Gateway &gt; S3 &gt; Glue &gt; Redshift &gt;&gt; reporting

I'm doing the SAA exam in about 10 days time. To prepare I purchase the Stephaane Maarek course and practice exams on udemy as I saw it was highly rated. Anyway, I did the practice exam included in the course today and got 83% which I was pretty pleased with. However on the practice exam 1 I just tried, I got 60% - this is the first exam in his practice exam pack. 

Is the practice exam he gives in the course more similar to the real exam or would it be the one from his practice exams pack? Would anyone know? 

Some of the questions on his practice exam pack were things I'm pretty sure weren't covered in the course so I'm not sure which one is a better indicator of where I am now. 

Also I have 9/10 days between now and the exam, to get from my current 60% to around 80/85 on practice exams, what's my best bet? I think going over the things I got wrong and also questions I got right but wasn't sure about is a good thing to do?

Some of you might know that I create AWS training courses - **but that isn’t what this post is about**.

As part of my course development - I’ve been working for a while on what I call \[**Advanced Demo**\] Lessons. These go beyond the usual DEMOS found in most courses, tackling more complex scenarios, they're longer and often involve Hybrid AWS and On-premises tech stacks.

I have a few of these advanced demos now in a [repo I manage](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) (they are all freely released from my courses which have the full video guided versions in)

# The Detail (more interesting)

The scenario is an on-premises web application which you want to migrate into AWS.

🟢 Single Server APP and single server DB

🟢 Connect the simulated on-premises environment and AWS using a VPC Peer

🟢 Provision RDS and EC2 in AWS - migrate the web assets using SCP

🟢 Provision a DMS replication instance, endpoints and task to replicate the DB

🟢 Cutover the application server to the new DB instance

isz5km,"I passed my SAP-C01 exam on Saturday, and I'm 16. Any advice on how to get an internship/part-time job?","Hey all,

Just wanted to share my experience prepping for the Solutions Architect Pro exam and hopefully instil some confidence in those who are prepping for their AWS exams. I passed it this past Saturday (Sep 12th) and I just found out my score was 831. From the title, you'll know that I'm 16. I'm turning 17 this year, and have had no hands-on experience in IT beforehand (I only got my Solutions Architect Associate cert last summer). (Note - I just saw another person who's 17 and passed his/her SAP-C01 exam as well. Makes me feel a little embarrassed as it might seem that I'm full of shit hahaha, and wanted to look good as well. I swear, I'm 16 tho.)

I studied for 2 months, but for the first month or so, I wasn't really going ""full out"" ham on studying. I wasn't even reaching my study goal of 6 hours a day until the last few weeks before I took the exam. Here's what I used to study:

\- ACloudGuru's SAP-C01 course

\- Linux Academy's SAP-C01 course (which was deprecated recently)

\- Jon Bonso's Practice Exams

\- AWS' Own Practice Exam (I only took it as I had a free coupon for a practice exam from passing the SAA-C01 exam last year. This was a mistake. Don't do it.)

\- Whitepapers (I read a bunch. Don't know if I actually retained any information from them. Tbh, I'm not sure why so many are recommended to be read by multiple prestigious AWS third-party training companies. Seems to me that the majority of them are focused for companies that are getting used to AWS/moving to the cloud.)

I'm not exactly in the mood to type out a long-ass summary about the specifics of what I did, and I don't think it will be very beneficial. So, to those who are grinding for their own cert/s, just use my post as a source of confidence!

About the other topic, tho - I feel like getting an internship is a great idea, no? I want to build a strong foundation, and I think that applying for an internship is the right way to go. Any advice on where to seek one/what companies I should be ideally working for? Just a heads up - I want to first intern before getting a real job also because my goal (and dream, too) is to get into a top US university. I've lived in Canada for over 10 years of my life, but I was born in California (thus, I'm considered as ""out-of-state"" - not ""international""). I also feel like having an internship might look a little better on my university applications than just a regular job - I might be wrong.

But, after application due dates are over (November), I want to start making some ""big bucks"" and work part-time. Is working a part-time job as a solutions architect feasible? I feel like most companies are looking for full-time architects, but could I possibly be seen as some sort of a ""child prodigy"" (or teen, for that matter) and attract some potential businesses? I'm not sure at all.

I would greatly appreciate some advice and insight!

Note - I'm not delaying going to university. I think that's plain stupid imho and my main focus isn't to make money. I'm not worried about paying off my student debt at all, too. I will most definitely do co-op, or at least work part time thru post-secondary. Plus, my application letter looks extremely tempting, no? Tempting enough for schools like UCLA, Berkeley, Columbia, hell, maybe even Stanford and Harvard to provide me with scholarships?

Just a side note - I averaged a 95% overall in Grade 11 (idk how that translates into GPA) and I've checked all the boxes of volunteer hours (100+), school participation (i.e. clubs - most notably Model UN), and, obviously, extra-curriculars (AWS certs). Sadly, I haven't taken any AP/honours classes (because, for some idiotic reason, my high school doesn't provide any excluding AP calc). But, I have been challenging myself through my secondary years (which is what universities like to see).

I just realized that this post is going way too far away from the topic of AWS, and I apologize for that lol. Again, I would really appreciate some thoughts and advice. Cheers!

Edit: Also, if you really don't believe that I'm 16-turning-17, I'll send yo bumass a selfie through instagram. Screw all that ""don't send strangers your photo"" crap. If someone calling me out he catching these (virtual) hands. ",2,awscertifications,2020-10-13

is6xg6,I don't know what to do next. Passed SAA-C02,"Background: My career up until now has been an Analyst over the past 5 years after graduating from an MS MIS program. I quit my job in February due to being miserable. It was hard to find a new job when Corona hit and I wasn't sure about building reports for another X years. 

In July I decided I wanted to get into Cloud because of things like market, possibility to work remotely in the future, and career growth. I decided on AWS and bought Stephane Maarek's SAA course (Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2020). Eventually thanks to this sub I bought the Tutorial Dojo's tests, and also dabbled into acantrill's course.

I decided I needed a certification as I don't have a comparable background If I wanted to get a job. My background is business/pricing/financial analyst work with knowledge in SQL and visualizations with some dabbling in R,Python,Data Mining, and ML. I thought I could get a certification and with my background hopefully find something to help learn on a job because I don't want to take a role keep learning and quit within a short period of time as I don't think my resume would look good after quitting the last role as well.

I passed my cert on Friday. (which was awesome!) and I would like to find a role to grow in. But when I look at job descriptions I'm not sure. It seems like there's nothing there for people who do want to learn have proven themselves a little. It seems like the expectation is you have to already be an expert and you have to be a perfect fit. And there just doesn't seem like clear pathways with job descriptions. Whats the difference between a Cloud Architect, Solution Architect, and a Cloud Analyst? Seems like a ton of roles with oddly varying descriptions and requirements.

I've even reached out to AWS recruiters on LinkedIn just trying to find advice only to be ignored.

I will do everything in my will to make this a reality even if it means keeping my head down and keep learning more certs and building my portfolio. Was hoping for thoughts or advice. This sub has been great for insights and it's been wonderful reading for insights, I thank you all!

Also quick summary on my perception of materials:
Stephane's course was magic. It felt to the point and easy to watch on 1.5x speed. But after the Bonso Tests I was shook getting 50-60% so studied those. I did up memorizing some answers but I don't have a problem because I memorized what the question was asking as well. I really appreciated TD's site as there were quick review sections.
For acantrill's site I only got through like 20% and its good material, I think it covers more nuanced things that Stephane's course but both are wonderful and just depends on how you are as a person.",4,awscertifications,2020-10-13
is4tro,What have you done with your certifications?,"For those who have reached their certification goals, what were the end results? Did you find that job or pay increase you were looking for?

Hope everyone is doing well and keeping safe. I am planning to appear for SAA-C02 next month and so far I have gone through A Cloud Guru, Stephen Marek's Course on Udemy and tried practice tests on WhizLabs.

I had the following two questions and would appreciate if you can help me out:

1. Is it a good idea to go through Jon Bonso's practice tests or are they similar to WhizLabs?  I have read a lot of about Bonso's here and I see they have 30 tests which is hell of lot more than Whizlabs. But I wanted to be double sure before buying it.
2. This is more in continuation to #1 - if you suggest Bonso's practice tests worth it, are there any active coupon codes? I saw the cost and could see it's $15 which is bit costly if I convert it to my currency. Before I invest the amount, I just wanted to check if there were any active coupon codes, just in case.

I truly appreciate if you have any others suggestions or feedback. I am really looking forward to passing this exam by next month.

iqg8a4,Passed SAA-C02,"Took 3 weeks of study, prior to this I had very little experience in AWS, just building a few EC2s at work.

Materials I used: Adrien Cantrill’s course and a few sections in ACG and Jon Bonsos practice tests. 

I’m not a fan of video based courses at all but I could really appreciate Adriens course, with so many things to memorize and understand how they function together he really does a good job emphasizing the important parts and visualizing them with diagrams as well. I’ll admit I skipped most of the demos and watched at 2x (maybe not the best idea) because I’m really impatient and not planning on working as a cloud architect, my career is in security.

My scores on the Jon Bonso practice tests were:
63, 69, 65, 70, 66 (didn’t get to the last one)

I also took a practice test from adriens course and did really bad like 55% I think, this crushed my confidence and my exam was the next day, but too late to reschedule so I just buckled down and studied hard for the last day. 

As for what was on the exam I recommend reading through every “passed” post on here and screenshotting the items they mentioned they saw, these were pretty accurate to my exam. I remember a bunch of questions on databases (DynamoDB, Aurora and a ton of RDS), lambda, SQS/SNS, nat gateway vs instance, Fsx Lustre, snowball, SCM. Overall it was pretty balanced between the sections.

During the exam I was not too confident, the questions were definitely on par with the difficulty and style of Bonsos tests, but just shorter questions. I somehow passed but only by a few questions, I definitely underestimated this exam.",16,awscertifications,2020-10-13

I have the SA exam next week Friday, so 8 days away. In preparation I did the Stephaane Maarek course over the course of about a month. However, I'm still averaging around 60-65% on the Maarek practice exams. I know from reading online people say I should be getting 80+ before booking. 

I need some advice on how to get ready. The main problem for me right now is that I get lost in small things, for example when EC2 is cheaper then RDS or when to use kinesis streams vs kinesis firehose etc. I only have a week so don't have the time to do the course again. 

My current plan is to delay the exam by a few days. I have a deadline of the 23rd September which is the latest I can do the exam with about 6/7 hours a day to revise. 

For people who have passed the exam, what's my best option here? I've found some cheat sheets on tutorialsdojo and plan to memorise those as much as possible. Additionally do the practice exams and the things I'm doing wrong read the explanation. What other kinda of things should or can I be doing?

* I took Stephane Maarek's course ([https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/)) and I found it very good. I went through the course videos and slideshows more than once.
* I created more than 1000 flashcards myself in order to memorize better the content of the course ([**https://www.brainscape.com/**](https://www.brainscape.com/))
* I practiced a lot using Jon Bonso's tests ([https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/)), take practice tests especially at the same time that you will be taking your exam. I scheduled my exam at 10 p.m so I was like 1 week before taking the tests at that time every day to get used to it. I went through the tests and explanations more than once as well.
* I went through [https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/)
* I read FAQS, especially for (EC2, S3, VPC, Route 53, RDS, SQS) ([https://pages.awscloud.com/Exam\_Preparation\_2020\_Solutions\_Architect\_Associate.html](https://pages.awscloud.com/Exam_Preparation_2020_Solutions_Architect_Associate.html)).
* I took AWS exam readiness (3 hours) and I participated in 1 free webinar but I found this to be more like something complementary.

Regarding the exam: Don't overthink an answer in the first try. Better select the option that makes more sense to you, mark the question for review, and move to the next question.

iq28pm,Passed Solutions Architect Associate yesterday!,"I took the SAA-002 certification exam yesterday morning, and passed!  I had originally thought about doing the online proctoring option from Pearson Vue, but then I read some horror stories about that option.  I just masked up and drove to my local testing location.

**Professional background:** 10 years as a Java and C# developer, then the last 3.5 years in cybersecurity (mainly CASB, WAF, and SEIM stuff).  I passed the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam in January before COVID hit.  My company is just now getting started with AWS.  We've used Organizations and Control Tower to stand up some accounts, and my role is basically to scan the accounts for CIS benchmarks and remediate the findings.

**Training/preparation:** My company had already scheduled a 4-day on-site AWS architecture training class for April, but we started working from home in mid-March.  That 4-day class turned into a Zoom remote class instead.  It was a good class, but was definitely NOT enough depth to prepare someone for the SAA exam.  So I bought the Udemy class from [**u/stephanemaarek**](https://www.reddit.com/user/stephanemaarek/) about 5 weeks ago and started watching sections almost every day.  I kinda slacked off and didn't finish his entire course.  I got to 85% complete on this past Saturday, and decided to go into cram mode before Wednesday morning.  I bought the Udemy practice tests from u/jon-bonso-tdojo, and started taking the practice exams and reviewing the answers.  I got through 3 practice exams by Tuesday night (slacking again, LOL), tried to take a 4th practice exam early Wednesday morning, but ran out of time and had to drive to the testing center.

**Test experience:** I think that the combination of Stephane's class and Jon's practice tests really prepared me for the real thing.  I felt immediately confident about the correct answer on probably 70% of the questions, and there weren't many (maybe 3 or 4) questions where I was totally lost.  There's a reason why the Stephane + Jon combo is commonly referenced on this subreddit (along with Adrian Cantrill too).

**Next up:** I've got my eye on the Security - Specialty certification.  It may be beyond my level of hands-on experience, but even if I fail the test I will have learned a lot during the study process.",7,awscertifications,2020-10-13
iq1ema,Passed DVA-01 with 904/1000,"I just took the exam yesterday afternoon after studying for about a week and a half. I got the SAA mid August.

I prepared by taking the ACG course made available on LA, then the LA course done by Fernando Medina Corey.I have to quickly interject here - ACG recently acquired LA and I'm a bit concerned because the quality of ACG courses are just no where near LA courses. ACG seems more focused on telling you what you need to know for the exam while LA seems more focused on actually teaching you concepts.

Anyway, I also read through a cheat sheet by Neal Davis for his course on Udemy (got it for free). I was going to do the actual course but it just seemed too bloated and I was starting to feel more prepared.

I would say that the most essential resource I used was the Bonso tests. They can't be done alone, though. The tests gets you use to the question style of the exam and trains you to think more critically and carefully - you start to consider every detail mentioned in the questions. Once you fail an exam,(oh, you will) read through ALL the question explanations and browse through AWS docs to supplement. I failed the first one but past the next 3 but I still read through all the question explanations.

Another thing I highly suggest is go through the AWS console as you review the exam questions. Click every box, every dropdown menu, read every info icon. That experiential knowledge will help make all the little details stick.

As far as the actual exam experience, it was A LOT easier than the Bonso exams. I could not believe how easy it was. Almost all the question choices had at least one obviously wrong choice and a lot of other choices were dead giveaways.

Don't get stressed over the time remaining. If you prepare enough, you will have plenty of time left. I had about 45min left. If you're stuck or are unsure about a question, just flag it for review. If you start to feel overwhelmed after a block of questions, try to close your eyes, and take deep breaths and clear your mind. After every 13-15 questions or so, I would stop and take about 20 long, deep breathes and it helped me reset.

As far as exam content, everything seems to be centered around: Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, S3 encryption and IAM. Those were the most numerous questions out of all. I would highly suggest going for the SAA first if you plan on getting a lot of AWS certs - it really laid a good foundation for me.",12,awscertifications,2020-10-13

Got Jon Bonso's practice tests on Udemy as well, and after following Stephane's course was averaging 63% - which I didn't feel was enough to feel confident, and I didn't just want to memorize answers.

So I enrolled in Adrian's course over at https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02, and followed through that doing as many labs as possible in the free tier (re-purposing some of the resources I had left over from Stephane's course).

ipxsyd,Passed DAS-C01 - AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty,"It was a hard exam and I was probably very lucky to pass. They really delved deep into the details. The answer choices were frustratingly similar and I ended up changing maybe 10 of my answers toward the end.

Total study time was 10 days with about 4-7 hours each day (I do not use AWS in my day job but recently passed the solutions architect associate exam). Everyone has a different approach but I think that dedicating consecutive days of intense studying helps with this exam where you have to memorize every little detail.

Unfortunately, there is not a lot of third-party study material out there. I used Kane and Maarek's course on Udemy but only watched it once. I skimmed through the white papers and FAQs and only watched a couple of the re:Invent videos. I purchased the Whizlab practice exams but found them to be exceptionally hard which did not make me feel good (scored &lt;50%). However, I would highly recommend BrainCert and the AWS practice exams. I really wished Jon Bonso had something here.

I hope that helps. Good luck to everyone taking it!",6,awscertifications,2020-10-13

iptsnm,Passed the SysOps after 15 Days of preparation,"I booked the exam before starting my preparation and gave myself 15 days for it.

I already got SAA and Dev Associate back in April and June.

I would say it was overwhelming to have a hard deadline and was considering postponing the exam the day before the exam day since I failed 2 practice tests that I took:

 

* (Jon Bonso's Practice exam) I lost my confidence. I went through the explanations for incorrect answers and just tried to understand the concepts better.

* Not panicking, I decided to do another one and failed it too, so I was really nervous now and thought maybe I should postpone my exam. I went through all the explanations for my wrong answers and decided not to do any more practice exams now.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to just go through my notes and sleep through it, he worst I could do was fail the exam.

But I did pass the exam and would say that even though it was overwhelming it worked out in the end!

I could have never done this in 2 weeks if I didn't have a hard deadline.

Resources I used:

* AWS SysOps course on freeCodeCamp YT by Andrew.
* Bonso's Practice exam.

Also, I think having hands-on experience and giving the other two certs really helped me pass this one.

According to my experience with all three Associates, I feel that following is the order, the hardest being the first:

* Solutions Architect
* SysOps Administrator
* Dev Associate",25,awscertifications,2020-10-13

ipkniy,Passed the AWS Data Analytics Exam! (DAS-C01),"Passed it! Don't have my score just yet, but I can attest that it is quite a difficult exam. I've taken CCP and the Machine Learning specialty (I'm a Data Scientist by trade so that one was much easier), but I had a much harder time with this one because of the more in-depth knowledge you need to know about the various services. I took about two weeks to study with no real experience with any of those services (had a work incentive to complete it by this Friday, or else I would have taken a few more days to study). 

Used the Udemy course as a beginner course which was helpful understanding the big picture, but there's quite a few things in the Udemy course that didn't show up on my exam at all (like IoT, and barely any DynamoDB), so don't study off of that course too much. After that, I pretty much just studied the documentation guides/FAQs for the core services (Kinesis, Glue, EMR, Redshift).  I also used skillcertspro to get additional practice tests, as well as Linux Academy's now depreciated Big Data course that had a practice exam. It took me three attempts on all the practice exams to get at least 85%. Once I was able to get 85% and above on all the practice tests I took, I felt more comfortable to sit for the exam. The Exam Readiness Course was also super helpful (took that twice), and I had a free voucher for a Practice Exam as well that I used. 

I also read the Big Data blogs which I thought were really helpful in identifying use cases and how to use the architecture and knowing which services talk to each other, and which don't. Also great for getting the most up to date information on services. I skimmed the whitepapers and found some use cases in those documents to be beneficial as well.

Good luck to people out there who are studying for this exam. It's a very difficult exam, but it's doable!",12,awscertifications,2020-10-13

This was the third time taking the SSA exam and the first time taking the C02 version (the first two attempts were with the CO1). It was a scary feeling hitting that submits button, not knowing whether I would see the words PASS or FAIL, but when the time came, I could not be happier.

&amp;#x200B;

Like a lot of other people on this subreddit, I'll post my thoughts and methods, however, I will also walk through some of the mistakes, realizations, and challenges I faced.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me 2 months to gain the confidence to take this exam. I graduated University on May 14th (officially) but did not start dedicating my time studying until around July. For reference, I have a CS degree but no experience in Cloud. For the entire July, I spent 3-4 hours every weekday watching the Linux Academy videos on 2x speed (I watched the A Cloud Guru Videos ([https://acloudguru.com/?utm\_source=legacyla&amp;utm\_medium=redirect&amp;utm\_campaign=one\_platform](https://acloudguru.com/?utm_source=legacyla&amp;utm_medium=redirect&amp;utm_campaign=one_platform)) a year before so I had an understanding of most concepts. Watching at 2x didn't bother me). Mid-July I finished watching every single video for the course, took a one week break, and started the entire thing over again. However this time, I took notes and created mind-maps.

&amp;#x200B;

As the one thing I have not seen as a resource in this subreddit, I would highly suggest ***Mind Mapping*** your notes if you are the kind of individual who prefers a more visual approach to learning. ***This helped me so much in determining relationships between services, dependencies, and understanding which layers fall under which services.*** I think, for myself, I can truly say I would not have passed this exam without it, but that is because I am one of those visual learners. Here is one example of a mind-mapping software: [https://bubbl.us/](https://bubbl.us/).

&amp;#x200B;

[Here is 1\/20th of the mind map I created. It takes a lot of work, but the work pays off.](https://preview.redd.it/g583w0w0idl51.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e25d9af76518275f5d5942a50f36ff5411ec865)

&amp;#x200B;

After watching and rewatching, I had the topics etched in my brain and the notes on paper. It was time to review them and begin practice exams. One thing I should note is that unlike a lot of people, I did not purchase Stephane Maarek's Course. This could have been a useful thing to do, but I already needed to save up for the exam and have 2 resources from before which were still useful. I used the TutorialsDojo exams that were updated for the C02 versions and consisted of 6 practice exams ([https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/)).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In the first attempt on the first exam, I got 55%. I also noticed there were a lot of topics that I had never seen before. It wasn't until the ACG and LA merger that I realized I was looking at the legacy course. The reason I was referencing that course is that it was in my ""recent courses"" list, meaning I had watched nothing new for the C02 exam, but also because the old course was not listed as deprecated until late August. This was stupid on my part, for not realizing, but it just meant I had to catch up on the smaller parts that were added.

&amp;#x200B;

For each practice exam, ***I went back through the questions (both correct and incorrect) and added the questions, answer choices, answer, and reasoning to the mindmap of the topics I created.*** So if the question was about S3 storage classes, I would create a relationship from that question to where in the mind map I wrote notes for the different types of storage classes. This allowed me to review all of the questions and the end, and if I wanted or needed to look at the overall subject more in-depth, I have a way to reference it. This also meant that I had one, singular source of notes that could reference any topic and question, with a visual representation and a more comprehensive way of understanding it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I finished all of the practice exams on August 31st (this past Monday) and went to an event for some non-AWS, work-related stuff from Tue-Thur to clear my head. During this time, in passing I would only review the notes, and other resources online. I would come to this subreddit to see what other resources people used, and there were a few good ones. I also went to Github and searched for review documents, and there were 3 good ones I used, but it really boils down to what works for you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TutorialsDojo Cheatsheets: [https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/)

Alozano Github (recommended by Adrian from LA): [https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course](https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly encourage you to review the comparison charts for services on the TD cheatsheets, as there were a lot of services that overlap in responsibility but have different use cases and conditions. Reading this and finding logical was to remember was key to making sure I didn't forget it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, on to the exam. I took the exam last night at 8:00 PM with PearsonVue Online. I probably should have scheduled it earlier, because the entire time I was psyching myself out. However, from morning to evening I took 4 more practice exams from Tutorials Dojo (the first 4 because they were not so fresh in my head). I scored an 83, 80, 76, and 83, so they were somewhat consistent. I sat down for the exam, and it was shocked by how much I learned but how much was not in there. Additionally, as a note, I have heard that not all exams are equal so this may very well not help you. I have heard that some people get some really easy exams with super simple topics, while others struggle because the questions focus on extreme details in services. I think I may have gotten lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The focus for most of the exam was S3 hands down. There was a lot that focused on Storage Classes and Lifecycle policies. There were a few on VPC's, Load Balancing, but the thing to remember is the 5 pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization because regardless of the question, it always comes down to these 5 things. The question will ask ***MOST cost-efficient, or FASTEST to transfer***. Take this into consideration when determining your answer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For the questions I did not know, I saved until the end (something I never do. For some stupid reason I try to go in order, and that's probably what contributed to the failure a year ago). All of the other questions, I either knew the answer straight away or used process of elimination. I believe I finished with 40 minutes to spare.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to one of my final points. From taking this 3 times, the biggest thing I chose to learn is knowing what each service does at a high level, including services that are not provided by the courses online. The new C02 course from LA covers topics like WAF and Shield but had I known that last year, and a question came up about it, I would have been able to eliminate it or select it within a heartbeat.

&amp;#x200B;

The topics that I had to spend a little more time learning/understanding/memorizing are:

\- S3/Glacier Select

\- Cross Account Bucket Sharing

\- Data Sync (copy larger amounts of files) vs. Storage Gateway (direct link to S3)

\- Macie (remember the words Personally Identifiable Information - PII)

\- ENI, ENA, EFA (Features of each, and when to use)

\- FSx for Windows and Lustre

\- HPC and its components (such as EFA)

\- DynamoDB vs Aurora vs Redshift vs RDS (like the fact that Aurora is an engine, Redshift is columnar, DynamoDB can allow frequent schema changes, etc)

\- Failover Policies

\- NAT Instance vs. NAT Gateway

\- VPC Endpoint Types and Which services can use them

\- VPC CloudHub and Transit Gateway

\- Autoscaling Policies (which instance is the first to terminate on a scale-down policy is a popular question: The one with the oldest configuration or least amount of traffic)

\- Application Integration (SQS, SNS, SWF, Step Functions, API Gateway)

\- Kinesis and all its child features (Firehose, Streams)

\- CloudHSM

\- KMS

\- Shield vs WAF (If it talks about DDoS Protections, think Shield. If they talking about XSS and Injections, think WAF)

&amp;#x200B;

Topics that were not on the course videos but I took time to learn:

\- CloudSearch

\- Amazon Glue

\- Amazon Lake Formation

\- AWS MQ

\- Amazon WorkDocs

\- Amazon Lightsail

\- AWS Batch

\- AWS ECR

\- AWS Outposts

\- AWS Neptune

\- AWS Timestream

\- AWS X-Ray

\- AWS Control Tower

\- AWS Config

\- AWS Trusted Advisor

\- AWS Migration Hub

\- AWS Amplify

\- AWS App Mesh

\- AWS Private Link

\- AWS Guard Duty

\- AWS Inspector

\- AWS Firewall Manager

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not to say this is everything, but for me, I spent a lot of time within the last few days brushing up on these subjects.  If anyone found this helpful (or not, please let me know) the feedback would be great! Thank you, and good luck future architects!

Prep materials: started with Stephane Maarek and Frank Kane Udemy course. Then I did the ACG Big Data course( they didn’t have a course for DAS) and finally the AWS Exam Readiness course. Once all this was done, I signed up for Whizlabs practice test and upon completion of that, I did the AWS practice test as well. 

Udemy course was not that great. The data collection and storage part is good. It falls short on Processing modules which I found was better on ACG course. The best out of all is the AWS exam readiness course. It is well structured and makes you want to redirect to the AWS documentation’s and white papers. 

Whizlab quizzes were ok. The AWS practice test was the closest to the actual test. Most of Whizlabs questions did not reflect what actually I got in the exam. I would have preferred a Practice test from Jon Bonso.

in3dy5,Passed AWS Machine Learning Specialty..!!,"I passed the AWS ML Speciality exam today. Here is my experience and the courses I did.

&amp;nbsp;


# AcloudGuru Course

A good introduction to basic ML and DS but in no way is sufficient to pass the exam. The part that stood out for me was the labs in the course. The labs are really great and definitely do a great job of explaining how to do different ML related stuff on AWS. Highly recommend doing all the labs if you plan to take this course. 


Note - If you are going to take Frank's Course on Udemy (below) then I suggest to the ACG course only until Chapter 5. For the remaining part, I feel Frank's course is way better.


# Frank/Stephane Udemy Course

Frank and Stephane are great instructors, you cannot go wrong with this course. Would highly recommend doing the Modelling part of the course. That one is an important part and I feel Frank does a good job in explaining the nitty-gritty involved and covering as much breadth as is required to pass the exam.


# Practice Tests


### ACloudGuru Practice Exam

I think this is the weakest practice exam of all. Not anywhere near to the actual exam.


### Frank's Full Practice Exam -

### Abhishek Singh's Practice Exam

These in my opinion were the best practice exams and closest to the real exam. Although these alone are not sufficient in passing the exam. The questions on the exam are tougher.


Overall, none of the exams do a great job in explanation, especially for the incorrect options. I think the JB tests have set the bar very high and I wished that we had JB tests for this exam.

In  the VPC that you are managing, it has one EC2 instance with its data  stored in its root volume. A 2nd level support engineer tried to stop  the EC2 instance using the AWS CLI to save costs. However, he received  an UnsupportedOperation error as a response.

What might be the cause of this?

&amp;#x200B;

*  The EC2 instance has been hacked.												 
*  AWS does not allow instances to be stopped through API calls.

in0wh5,"Passed AWS SAA-C02 couple of days ago,","I just passed AWS Solution Architect Associate couple of days back. My score 760, not that great, but atleast I got certified.

Here was my strategy.

**Courses Purchased:** Adrian Cantrill (/u/acantril), Jon Bonso (/u/jon-bonso-tdojo) Exams on Tutorials Dojo.

**Time taken to study:** 6 weekends (8-10 hours per weekend).

**Background:**

I have been mobile developer for 9 years and by chance, I have been working on a serverless backend on AWS since a year. I want to add a legitimacy of being backend developer I have decided to study and gain some certifications, the strategy is to gain two AWS certificates by the year ends. 

So when I started to think about it seriously, I have discovered this community and Adrian helped me to pick my first AWS certification. The choice of course is easy one as I had plenty of time to study and a lot of area to cover, I had picked Adrian's course (again suggested by the community here). I started in first weekend of July, I studied every weekend for 10-12+ hours. Adrian's course really helps to fill the gap of what you don't know and makes comfortable around the parts of what you have never touched. The study ended around couple of weekends back. After that I took Jon Bonso's practice tests (A must) on tutorials dojo. I didn't score that good on TD (highest being 75% in all the exams), but all the failing questions were eye openers for me, I learnt a lot from those failed answers and these added many lines from notes.

Speaking about notes, here is the [whole searchable site for my notes](https://notes.prashamhtrivedi.in/saa/index.html).

**Topics covered in exam:**

S3 Buckets and storage classes and Lifecylces, EBS vs EFS vs Instance Store, Auto Scaling Groups and Load Balancers, Lambda &amp; Dynamo DB, Combinations of services (like Kinesis Firehose, Lambda, SQS, SNS, Dynamo DB) to create some solutions. Choice between scaling databases and implementing DX or ElastiCache.

**Tips**

* Pay attention in the course materials, whichever course you chose, there are lot of overlap and confusion in service.
* Adrian's tips about exam (the whole last section itself) is really helpful.
* Read every question carefully, If you're a fast reader like me, it's highly unlikely that you'll run out of the time. But one mis-read or mis-understood word can alter the meaning of questions and options can be changed drastically.

Anyways, thanks the whole community, and specially Adrian And Jon.

ilvxu1,Passed the Developer Associate,"Passed the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam. Thank you, Tutorials Dojo and Stephane Maareks course for the amazing practice test. 

There were some topics on the exam which were not covered in the practice exams but were covered by the course, but overall it really helps to go over the tests with a good understanding to appear to the exam! This exam didn't take much time to finish as I had over 40 mins left after completing all the questions. I used the rule of only spending 1: 30 seconds on each question which really helped me stay focused. I did however take all the rest of 40 mins to review my answers twice, which really helped me go back and correct the questions and really spend more time on those questions which I felt were hard (It's not a race lol take your time!). Online Proctor (Pearson VUE) went really smoothly with no troubles. 

P.S - Deployment was the only section I found hard and some s3 encryptions questions which were not covered completely.

**TL;dr One of my most popular demos in my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Course is one where you create a serverless application using S3, API Gateway, Lambda, Step functions, SES and SNS. I've just recorded an updated version for my SA Pro course and thought it might be cool to let the community have a play around for free.**

**So... its the latest free advanced demo on my AWS Advanced Demo/Labs Repo :)**

**There is a video guided version in my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Course (**[**https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional**](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional)**) . And my other courses at** [**https://learn.cantrill.io**](https://learn.cantrill.io/)

# The Background (might be interesting)

Some of you might know that I create AWS training courses - **but that isn’t what this post is about**.

As part of my course development - I’ve been working for a while on what I call \[**Advanced Demo**\] Lessons. These go beyond the usual DEMOS found in most courses, tackling more complex scenarios, they're longer and often involve Hybrid AWS and On-premises tech stacks.

With this advanced demo I wanted to help people tackle the type of architecture evolution they might face in an interview question or pre-screen test.

I have a few of these advanced demos now in a [repo I manage](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) (they are all freely released from my courses which have the full video guided versions in)

\- [Hybrid Systems Manager](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/tree/master/aws-patch-manager)

# The Detail (more interesting)

It's a simple 'pet cuddle reminder' application.

The Code loads from an S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled.

JS loaded into the browser, communicates with an API Gateway using a lambda integration.

The lambda function calls a statemachine

The state machine handles the delay, and notifications to SNS and SES.

iloa67,Any recommended study materials for prepping for the AWS Certified Security Specialist exam?,I have LinuxAcademy videos and access to AWS. Is there anything other quality materials that would be recommended in passing this exam for someone who has entry level exposure to AWS Security?,1,awscertifications,2020-10-13
ilnheg,Passed AWS-CCP. Immense thanks to Jon Bonso and Neal Davis,"Had appeared for the exam this Tuesday (01/09/2020). Finished it in about 45 mins, revision included. I was very skeptical about appearing for it online since I had read numerous horror stories about the online exam going haywire and hours long support calls here on this subreddit. So I went to the test center which opened in my country in late August.

Preparation:

1. Total time taken - Roundabout 2 weeks (because I am a dumbass and particularly bad at taking exams)
2. Practice Tests - Jon Bonso from Udemy. This is the real deal and they come very close to the actual exam. His explanations were really helpful. I did use Whizlabs test too but they weren't as good as Jon Bonso ones. Not bad, just not on his level.
3. Study material - Some whitepapers (Well Architected Framework, Best Practices) and rest from Neal Davis' free CCP notes available on cloudtraining website. I found them to be really concise and better than diving through the FAQ section of each service on AWS website. Also made a lot of hand written notes.

Score - 921

Where do I go from here ? AWS SysOps Administrator.

Why ? Because I have been working as an Operations Engineer (Sysadmin/Junior DBA) for about 4 years now and most of what is covered in SOA, I've been doing that on a daily basis in an on-Premises Data Center environment. I've already covered the Stephane Marek course on udemy once and have the Jon Bonso tests with me for SOA.

The thing that this exam helped me the most with was building confidence about taking an AWS exam and got me acquainted with the exam taking process too. I really don't remember last time I sat for an exam. The 50% discount coupon I got was just cherry on top.",3,awscertifications,2020-10-13

Well, for me, I would think running a large scale project would be ideal that covers most topics covered in the AWS solution architect exam.

Is there any tutorial or large scale project out there one can follow and do that covers most topics and you can do it yourself on your own free tier of AWS? Especially one that isn't tons of hours of videos to complete? Just something semi quick (relative to topics covered of course), but touches on VPC, EC2, Lambda, subnets, gateways, S3, EBS, etc. etc. etc..?

Without going into whats covered in the exam there are three major reasons I'm not going to try to take this exam from home again:

1) No scratch paper allowed - in the testing centers I believe this is allowed and some of the questions were a good two paragraphs of text. Being able to sketch out what they were asking would have been extremely helpful.

2) Damn neighbor's dog - from about question 5 until the end of the test I had to deal with constant rhythmic barking. Over an hour with no breaks other than the occasional yelp / wine to break up the barks. It made it hard to concentrate

3) Being watched on webcam - I got scolded for moving my lips while reading the questions. I didn't  even realize I was doing it but it was just another distraction you wouldn't have in a testing center.

**Top tip:** 

Spend less time on Reddit and more time on the courses and practice exams.

 

 \--------------------------------------------

**Too short; want more:**

**Why I did it:**

I wanted to get more exposure to the cloud computing sector, what is the current state of art with what you can get from the cloud, and how can it add value to businesses going forward. I am looking to work closer to that sector going forward relating to asset management, strategy, or solutions architecture.

**Who am I:**

My background is in engineering, electrical and mechanical, so no formal or major experience as a programmer. I have very little experience as a programmer and/or in the cloud, although it has always been tangential to my work. 

I started a business in 2009 in the renewable energy space, and it involved the development of a web portal and SMS tool for monitoring large scale wind farms. It is a LAMP(Perl/PHP) monolithic stack and its sitting on a simple single IP cloud platform. I wireframed and specced it and a friend of mine built it and brought my wild expectations to reality.

I’ve a PhD in microelectronics, and an MBA, so quite used to continuous professional development and thus exam prep.

**What I did:**

**Day 1** – started A. Cantrill’s course from his own site. I reviewed what is out there, and in hindsight from the exam last Friday, you really need to be sure you are using the absolutely latest material and courses. Adrian’s course is phenomenal, I will return to the lessons time and time again if and when I am building solutions, and would easily consider purchasing the Pro course from him just to have the material for any research. It is very visual, and during the exam I had images from his slides in my head to help answer some of the tougher questions.

I got through his course at anything from 1X to 2X speed. Closer to 2X for theory and tutorials, and closer to 1X for demos and more complex topics.

I got distracted from time to time looking up the Well Architected Framework and reading in depth on some topics in the AWS documentation which is incredible. Also very interesting stuff in general in the AWS resources on their website, blog, and even podcasts to stay up to date with what’s new as they pump out stuff every week. I also watched a few interesting videos from the re:Invent to see how companies are using their tools, I recommend Netflix talks, and Werner Vogel’s videos. 

**Day 22** – Started Tutorial Dojo practice exams, and their flash cards and summary material. Also used Stephane Maarek’s course in parallel for a quicker review of concepts, but didn’t get through it much as it is a little dryer with more text and bullet points, and less diagramming. But Stephane does touch on stuff that Adrian does not, so it is all very useful in increasing your exposure. Your choice of course will depend on your learning style, prior experience, and requirements.

The Tutorial Dojo answers are very complete, and I ended up going back to my notes and demos from A Cantrill's course to drive home the concepts I was weaker on. On the practice exams I was always doing very well for time, it was simply my lack of knowledge on the broad range of topics.

**Day 30** – Booked test that morning and took it that evening after revising for the day.

Very tough, and lots of respect for the exam. First 10 questions were tough long-style architecture questions where you needed to know your stuff. By the time I was at question 15 I was not in the most positive of moods. But they got easier after that in my question set. I was quite good for time at the end, so I had time to review the tougher questions I flagged, and I'm sure I got some of them right on second review. So, watch your timing if you can.

AWS have a mantra about Bar Raisers which ensures they have the best of talent, and after the exam I do believe that a lot of questions are quite good at testing your ability to implement their solutions, as opposed to simply memorizing for the exam. 

**Takeaways:**

**- A Cantrill** – If you want a detailed, visual, methodical, repeatable, reliable course that will give you more than just an exam pass (theory, demos, and a future reference of code and architectures), then don’t hesitate any further on choosing Adrian’s course. If you give yourself time to absorb the course in full, you will easily pass the exam. And you will have to appreciate Adrian’s ability to keep it updated to match current status quo. It is 50 hours plus of great content, but easy to watch faster as Adrian speaks clearly, slow and consistent.

**- Stephane Maarek** – If you want a complete exam prep for SAA-C02 where you possibly have prior experience with cloud, then Stephane’s course is unbeatable at the price point. A minor detail, but it is much more difficult to watch at higher speeds, as Stephane does have a stronger accent and speaks faster.

**- Tutorial Dojo** – practice exams are great mainly for the detailed answers. Be aware they are not flawless, a good amount of questions are outdating quickly. But I found that (thankfully) I was detecting this, which caused me review questions with AWS documentation to get the correct understanding, and this reinforced topics more. You will also start answering from memory, so make sure you get the best use from the first run through the tests.

**- A Cloud Guru** – I have to give credit to ACG, as a friend who works at AWS recommended using ACG for my intro to cloud back in July. I did use their course at the start in July when my eyes could only see as far as Cloud Practitioner cert. I appreciate what they have done and are doing. But their AWS serverless platform is not the fastest or most intuitive to use, their content was patchy and inconsistent as they are trying to update an older course, and I knew quickly it was not going to be right for me. They have acquired Linux Academy so I would hope they are onto bigger and better things now and in the very near future, but I am afraid for the coherency and consistency of their courses, as I was already frustrated before the merger with Linux Academy.

**- AWS** – Finally, I chose AWS for its enterprise market share and the growth, ambition and determination of the Amazon way. Google is definitely out front on the strength of its G-Suite tools and AI, and Microsoft still has its legacy on Windows and their productivity tools. But today, AWS definitely has the momentum and are probably the most aggressive and dynamic of the bunch.

Cloud computing is definitely an enabler for anyone serious about leveraging tech in their company, and 2020 has definitely accelerated the shift to Cloud. But I am also hesitant about the unknowns when it comes to true Total Cost of Ownership once you have tied the knot with a one provider and start to grow your business.

ik3zx6,New to AWS but passed the Cloud Practioner Exam in 3.5 hours of study,"I was bored this weekend after studying for CCSP so I decided to schedule the exam on Friday night for Sunday afternoon.  I could only study 2.5 hours on Saturday realizing I needed to get familiar with AWS terminology.  I put in an extra hour before taking the test Sunday afternoon and was pretty sure I would fail it but not by that much but when I clicked END after the 65 questions I was pleasantly surprised I had passed.  I know the CP exam is the beginner exam but to pass it in less than 4 hours of study was pretty good for me.  That all said, I do have a masters in cyber, 25 years in tech, and 11 certifications so all of that may have helped to some degree but that was the fastest I ever completed any cert.  Even ITILv4 I spent 4 hours with CISSP being the longest at 20 days and 5 to 6 hours a day every day.

ik2b57,AWS Certified Developer DVA-P01 Practice Exam - S3 Encryption,"Hi, another question : 

A company wants to store sensitive user data in Amazon S3 and encrypt this data at rest.

The company must manage the encryption keys themselves and use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption.

How can a developer meet these requirements ?

&amp;#x200B;

**A**. Enable default encryption for the S3 bucket using a custome-provided keys option.

**B**. Provide a private encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.

**C**. Provide a public encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.

**D**. Provide a symmetric encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.

&amp;#x200B;

B/C are wrong.

I do not kwnow how to choose between A and D.

It depends on the meaning of « must manage the encryption key ».

If the company want to « store » the keys ==&gt;  Is is D.

If the company does not want to « store » the keys ==&gt; Is may be A via KMS CMK ( with KMS CMK you have to manage yourself the key).

I would choose D because option A is working only if there are nothing on the header ==&gt; if we choose specific option in the header (like { ""s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption"": ""AES256"" }) it will override the default encryption.

I never had an ACG subscription, so I can't speak to this personally, but I do know that when it was announced that ACG had bought LA there was a lot of concern about it on online forums, with the general consensus that the ACG courses were shorter, less in depth, and overall of a much lower quality. That they were cram sessions designed to make you able to bluff your way through the certification exams, not an actual deep dive education to get you job ready like LA's classes seemed to be.

ijaq2s,Passed SAA-CO1 and DVA-C01; Sharing my tactics to pass the exam,"Hello guys,

I just passed the DVA-01 two days ago and SAA-01 last March. I would like to say thank you to all of the members of this subreddit. Your post on how you tackle the exam really helped me and I would like share what are my study tactics.

**Background:**

* Family man (can review only for 2-4 hours per day)
* Has previous experience with AWS on the job mostly on EC2, S3 supplemented with the free-tier
* Has a 9 hour job

**Tools used in SAA-01:**

* Stephane Maarek SAA course (Udemy)
* Jon Bonso Practice Test (Udemy)
* Neal Davis Test (Udemy)
* [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Study Guide: Associate SAA-C01 Exam](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111950421X)

**Tools used in DVA-01:**

* Stephane Maarek DVA course (Udemy)
* Jon Bonso Practice Test (Udemy)
* [AWS Certified Developer Official Study Guide: Associate (DVA-C01) Exam](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119508193)

**Tools used in both exam:**

* Notebook for taking notes
* AWS Whitepapers
* AWS Docs ands FAQs

&amp;#x200B;

""*If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles"" - Sun Tzu*

First evaluate yourself how big the gap of your AWS knowledge in respect to the exam you wish to take.  Use Jon Bonso's first exam to help you gauge your initial knowledge. Then plan how long will you study for the course.

&amp;#x200B;

I used the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) for estimating my study duration:

E = (O + 4 \* M + P) /6

where:

* E is the calculated estimation
* O is the optimistic estimation
* M is the mostly likely estimation
* P is the pessimistic estimation

My E in days  was (45 + 4 \* 60 + 80) /6 which is 60.83 days.

&amp;#x200B;

**Create a 'death ground'**

Sun Tzu said of creating a death ground - a place where an is backed up against some geographical feature like a mountain, river or a forest. For us, it' s the **examination date**. After you estimated your study duration, add 3 - 5 days and that will be your exam date.

Why do we need to do this? To create a **sense of urgency**. We are creatures of habit and if our situation is always constant, we tend to forget our priorities.

**Never move the exam date** since it will destroy your study momentum unless it is a real emergency.

&amp;#x200B;

**Write notes** in your notebook during the Maarek course.

* A personal opinion; I can remember better if I write something before.

**Use a pool of practice tests.**

* The three exams that I used target different aspects of the services which I really valued.
* Use different exams to shatter your confidence that you already a lot. :)

**How to use the practice tests**

* Assuming you have at least 12 practice exam, use them in a circular fashion.
* Use the exam in an M-W-F or T-TH-S fashion in the week. Compress or expand them if need based on your schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

|Week1|Week2|Week3|Week4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Exam1, Exam2, Exam3|Exam4, Exam5, Exam6|Exam7, Exam8, Exam  9|Exam10, Exam11, Exam12|

|Exam1, Exam2, Exam3|Exam4, Exam5, Exam6|Exam7, Exam8, Exam  9|All Exams|

&amp;#x200B;

**Experience in SAA-C01:**

I took the exam in a testing facility (pre-COVID19) and was really confident taking the exam. Most of the topics revolved in EC2, Autoscaling, S3 and Disaster Recovery. My score is in the low 900s. I did not also move the examination date and I started reviewing around end of January this year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Experience in DVA-C01:**

Most of the exam question revolved in the API Gateway, ECS, Load Balancing, Lambda. I really got bitten by the API Gateway since that is the one service I did not focus coming in to the exam ( more on Xray, Cloudwatch, Cloudtrail, Compute services). COVID also put a monkey wrench in the schedule which affected home-work schedule. Personal emergency also hampered the exam which needed to be moved twice. I scored in the low 800s.

&amp;#x200B;

ij6bi0,Correct Answer?,"Hello all, I'm studying for the Solutions Architect Pro exam, and I came across this question in one of my purchased practice exams:

**Your startup company is building a web app that lets users post photos of good deeds in their neighborhood with a 143-character caption/article. You decided to write the application in ReactJS, a popular javascript framework, so that it would run on the broadest range of browsers, mobile phones, and tablets. Your app should provide access to Amazon DynamoDB to store the caption. The initial prototype shows that there aren't large spikes in usage. Which option provides the most cost-effective and scalable architecture for this application?**

A - Configure the ReactJS client with temporary credentials from the Security Token Service using a Token Vending Machine (TVM) to provide signed credentials to an IAM user. This will allow PUT operations to DynamoDB. Serve your web application from an NGINX server hosted in a fleet of EC2 instances that are load-balanced and auto scaled. Your EC2 instances are configured with an IAM role that allows PUT operations in DynamoDB.

B - Register the web application with a Web Identity Provider such as Google, Facebook, Amazon or from any other popular social sites and use the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity  
 API of STS to generate temporary credentials. Create an IAM role for that web provider and set up permissions for the IAM role to allow GET operations in S3 and PUT operations in DynamoDB. Serve your web app out of an S3 bucket enabled as a website.

C - ​Register the web application with a Web Identity Provider such as Google, Facebook, Amazon or from any other popular social site. Create an IAM role for that web provider and set up permissions for the IAM role to allow PUT operations in DynamoDB. Serve your web application from an NGINX server hosted on a fleet of EC2 instances, with a load balancer and auto scaling. Add an IAM role to the EC2 instance to allow PUT operations to DynamoDB tables.

D - Configure the ReactJS client with temporary credentials from the Security Token Service using a Token Vending Machine (TVM) on an EC2 instance. This will provide signed credentials to an IAM user allowing PUT operations in DynamoDB table and GET operations in the S3 bucket. You serve your mobile application out of an S3 bucket enabled as a web site.

The correct answer is B, but this confuses me a little. In the last sentence of choice B, it says ""Serve your app out of an S3 bucket enabled as a website"". But the website isn't static, as it allows users to post photos; S3 static website hosting can't be implemented. Am I missing something here?

Fiver minutes later, a chat pops up and the guy says my video feed is bad, he ask me to check my internet connection and pause the exam. It took me to a wait screen where I waited as instructed for 20 minutes before getting tired. My internet connection seems to be ok.

I restarted the app, because I didn't know what to do, got back to the same screen, but this time after a few minutes someone came up and ask me to show him my desk and release my exam again, only to get a black screen. I tried to chat to tell him that and the computer just hung. Had to forcefully reboot.

That happened like 3 times for a period of 2 hours. Then somehow it got fixed I started the exam again, really tired but determined to give it a last try and seconds after another guy pop up again to tell me my video is bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Max CIDR per VPC is 5. For each CIDR:   
• Min size is /28 = 16 IP Addresses  
• Max size is /16 = 65536 IP Addresses  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Because VPC is private, only the Private IP ranges are allowed:   
• 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)   
• 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)   
• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) 

What I find confusing in the above is that he mentions in VPCs since it is private youre only allowed the following Cider ranges /8, /12, /16 but each VPC is allowed 5 CIDR ranges max and you can set the size to a MAX of /16 and MIN of /28, which /28 is **outside** of the private Ranges defined , so how is this possible?

**C**. Authentificate to the Amazon Cognito user pool directly

**D**. Federate authentification using Login with Amazon to AWS Security Token Service (STS)

**E**. Federate authentification using Login with Amazon to the Amazon Cognito user pool

For me the better would be ""Cognito user pool directly"" and then exchange token to credentials via Amazon Cognito identity pools.

But there is no such answers.

B is wrong.

We can use Federate authentification with Cognito user pool ==&gt; i choose E.

As we need S3 calls and SQS  i would choose  Amazon Cognito identity pool (as we can use it without User pools) =&gt; A

Background:Developer for 5 years,no experience using AWS.I had done Azure Fundamentals(AZ-900) six months ago,it helped in understanding things like scale-out,scale up,elastic,pay as you go pricing,regions,availability zones.

Prep:Work gave us ACloudGuru subscriptions and told us to finish their course to get certificate voucher.I felt that it wasn't enough to pass the exam.I followed this sub's advice,got Stephane Maarek course and Jon Bonso test.

I completed Stephane's videos in 15 days without any hands on.I enjoyed watching his videos and liked the way he gave background/context on topics before going into it.For example CORS or Docker,this helps when you don't have prior experience on it.

Took three of Bonso's tests,with scores 63%,72%,72%,saved the fourth for the week before actual exam.I went through the test's long,well written answer explanations,some of the cheat sheets,read Stephane's slides few times.Took the tests again,this time got 80-90 %.Fourth test score was 80%.Stephane's practice test in the course was updated during this time,earlier it was easy,the current version is hard and more helpful.

Exam:It  was neither easy nor too difficult for me.I took more time than practice tests to complete the first round and mark answers.May be because of the wording as I was used to Bonso's test.Was left with just 12 minutes to go back for another sweep,couldn't go back to all the questions and also didn't change any answer.I had questions on S3 :encryption(too many),events, EC2: IAM role,credentials file related,EBS attached to EC2, Cognito: unauthenticated access,adding custom logo, KMS: envelope encryption, Dynamo db:  which index to use based on the table described,read/write performance improvement,no calculations,one or two cloud watch and x-ray questions,Beasnstalk blue green deployment,one step function question on how to capture error(catch,retry with resultpath) which I could only guess.

iiacdk,2 days till Developer Associate exam- how to fill in knowledge gaps,"Booked my exam while I was getting mid-high 70s on CloudGuru and Whizlabs

Now getting failing marks (high 60s-low 70s) on Jon Bonso and later Whizlabs exams.

I have some major knowledge gaps especially when it comes to the CLI and HTTP errors for all the different services. Any tips on how to revise for these types of questions- other than memorising the Developer Guides.

I have a more general weakness when it comes to Elastic Beanstalk, API Gateway, EC2 specifics and XRay. Although going through the developer guides and such should help with those.

A lot of questions on:
NAT Gateways, 
Migrating databases, 
Fail over on databases, 
S3 for websites, 
Disaster recovery, S3 storage / archiving

Other questions
Best practices for Private and public subnets (what should be where I.e. EC2, DB, Nat gateway, routes, security groups) 

I had a couple of JSON questions in regards to what the script allows / Denys for S3 buckets

I did struggle in the exam, the first question which I cannot recall now did stop me in my tracks which wasn’t a nice feeling, however seemed to go ok after that.

I kept confusing myself due to the way the answers are display in regards to s3 life cycles, my eyes just glaze over lol

The practice exams in Stephane Maareks course and Jon Bonso’s are absolutely spot on, even down to the trick answers that AWS like to throw at you.

Just want to say a massive thank you to Stephane for that course, the amount of work you must have put into it is inspiring.

Stephane explains everything super duper simply and has nice hands on examples. I had previously tried Linux Academy but their course needs some updating. Did not go over stuff like Elastic Beanstalk or API gateway enough for the exam.

**Best Practice Tests:** [Jon Bonso AWS Certified Developer Associate Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams-amazon/) 

These exams are fire. I got 49% on the first two, studied a bit, got 68% on the third one, and by the end I got 81%. They resemble the test very closely and I even saw some of them on the test. 

**Supplemental Practice Tests:** [Stephane Maarek Practice Exams | AWS Certified Developer Associate 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-tests-dva-c01/)

I'd like to take my SAA-C02, but really my goal is to learn AWS. I've been the ""VMWare guy"" for years at my company and I love working with VMWare, but we're moving to more microservices/cloud options so I don't want to one day be out of a job.  


I don't do well with testing, but I do them regardless. I have the AWS CCP, a few versions of VCP, some MCSE etc. I can do a test when I need to. I'd really like to find a course with as much hands-on learning as possible. If anyone ever worked with the Bosen software or the old CBT Nuggets labs for CCNA those are more my speed. I looked at CBT and it looks like it's mostly videos as well.

igbd7y,Passed AWS Developer Associate exam with 10 days of preparation.,"Score : 789 ( Wished for a higher score but I’m glad I passed )

My company offered a voucher and I’m glad I took upon the chance to write the exam.

Resources that I studied from :

1. ACloudGuru AWS Certified Developer - 2020 Course
2. FreeCodeCamp AWS Certified Developer “Pass the exam” - 16 hour video split into part 1 and 2
3. ExamTopic aws developer associate questions - actual questions that have appeared on the exam

I made a lot of notes from both the acloudguru and the freecodecamp videos. I also took the practice exams on acloudguru several times. The questions I got in the exam were close enough to what I got in the practice exams.

I did a demo or two but didn’t have enough time to explore all the features. I have had no experience working on AWS and passing this certification has motivated me to get more practical experience.

Please do suggest me some personal projects I can take up on AWS.

**PS : I wouldn’t suggest cramming as I had to write the exam within 15 days of receiving the voucher.**",14,awscertifications,2020-10-13

ig7gps,I just Passed the AWS SA Associate (SAA-C02) Exam,"I'm so happy I passed my SAA-C02 exam via remote just - Update score when arrives... but I'm confident in high score.

A month ago my senior suggested I start working towards it - in past I've been pretty bad with exams. My senior is an old student of /u/acantril so I google and found his new course [https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02) and from this reddit learned about [tutorialsdojo.com](https://tutorialsdojo.com) and [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) 

I cannot thank those resources enough. Adrian is a kind and patient person on #saa-c02-studygroup on that slack and course he make is in my thoughts the best on market. Its long (\~50-60 including demos) but I feel like I could get a job with AWS now. Don't make mistake and buy cheaper or take free if you can avoid - cheaper doesn't include techstudyslack level of support and free YouTube and others are all bad/out of date.

He must have spent 5-10 hours with me in chat answering my silly questions - but never made me feel bad. Always said 'no question is stupid'

I had similar experience to other peoples on here on topics, but some thing I can remember

&amp;#x200B;

* S3 is a lot of the exam ... I would think 30+% had some S3
* CloudFront you need to know
* Storage gateways you need to know
* FSx both windows and Lustre you need to know
* Elasticache
* Datasync
* VPC and gateways
* RDS - backups and HA were importants
* EC2 and Lambda
* NATGW/Bastion different
* VPN also Direct Connect
* Transit gateway
* Snowball
* Global Accelerator
* WAF
* I update more later when I think.

Other resources I use

* Tutorials dojo cheat sheets
* [https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course](https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course) notes of other student

All I say, is /u/acantril course cover 100% of everything I had seen in exam. I expected to nervous but finished exam with 30 minutes remaining. The [tutorialsdojo.com](https://tutorialsdojo.com) questions felt same as exam, not much harder as everyone said - but the course prepared me - the visual and funny graphics in the course stuck in head at all times ... really helped.

ifrjrr,A Pearson VUE Chronicle,"This is gonna be a long documentation of my experience with Pearson VUE when I took my Certified Developer Associate Exam (DVA-C01) last week. This was my first certification exam ever so my experience may have been new only to me but I thought it was worth sharing anyway. I scored a 924/1000 but more on my actual exam over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/ifofct/passed_certified_developer_associate_exam_dvac01/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).

So this is what happened on exam day. I was scheduled for an exam at 1:30pm. The email and website said that I must start check in 30 minutes before the start time, so I did just that. I began the check in process on the OnVue application at 1pm. The process is not a simple ID verification task by a person on video. Instead they you have to do some of the steps on your laptop/PC and take pictures on your phone. *So don't keep your phone away just yet*; you will need it. The process of uploading the photos was finicky and I had to refresh for it to work multiple times. After about 20 minutes, I was done with the check in process which consisted of pictures of myself, 4  views of my desk and front and back of ID.

Now began the first wait of the day. The screen said that I was to obey all rules they had just shown, which included keeping the phone away from you and no sounds in the environment. So, naturally, I put my phone on silent and put it hidden from my sight so as to not distract me. The screen also read that a proctor is verifying my info and will soon join me. Now here is my first mistake of the day. I had no clock in my room. I am accustomed to seeing the time on my phone or laptop, but my phone was away from me and my laptop was literally hijacked by this proctoring application; so much so, that I couldn't see the time at the top of my screen (Mac) or switch windows or anything. There I was sitting and staring at my face for God knows how long (turned out to be 45 minutes). Finally, the proctor connects through chat on the application and asks me to show him around through video and to clear up some parts of my desk. He verifies all the details and says that he is ready to release the exam to me. He tries doing so, but nothing happens. He tries multiple times but nothing seems to work. He ends up telling me that he is gonna transfer me to someone else who can release it for me. I asked him whether I was to remain on the laptop and wait for a call through the application or through mobile. He said that it was gonna be on the application and that I shouldn't use my phone. Again, I wait for what felt like eternity for a call from the second guy. I never get a call on the application and I grow impatient. I was sitting there for what felt like 2 hours when I decided to go check my phone. Alas! I had 13 missed calls from Pearson vue support. How on God's holy earth am I supposed to lift a phone if you're threatening to terminate my exam if I go to my phone!!! Consequently, I check my email and see a cancelation confirmation with refund.

I was very disappointed at this point with the proctoring system and tried contacting customer support 4 times to identify how to prevent this if I rescheduled for a different time. They were incredibly hard to get a hold of, but when I finally did, they said keep your phone on ringer nearby and lift it only when you think you have a problem. I didn't understand how I would judge when it was my first time taking an online proctored exam. Nevertheless, now I knew what an abnormal situation was like, so I was ready to schedule again. By now it was 5 o'clock. My original exam was scheduled for 1:30pm. I was beginning to feel like I was forgetting things and losing focus from the actual exam, but I knew that taking it now is better than taking it tomorrow in this situation. I ended up scheduling again that evening.

This time I was aware of the process and somehow it went smoothly this time around. I still kept my phone on silent but I kept it at a distance from which I could see the screen light up if anybody called. I also placed a clock in my room so I know how long I've been waiting (you're not allowed to wear wrist watches). The exam was incredibly easy and I was able to focus completely on the exam.

Advice to Pearson: Please fix your rules. If you're gonna call us, at least make the rules such that we can lift your call and if you can't handle customer support then please do not cancel an exam. I was fortunate to have time in the day to schedule another exam, but not everyone will..

TLDR; Keep your phone in a noticeable place to identify whether someone is calling you or give your phone to someone else in your home so that they can lift and give it to you if they call. Also, keep a clock in your room to know how long you've been waiting so you can judge if you've been waiting too long to warrant getting up from your seat and checking your phone or canceling the exam.",3,awscertifications,2020-10-13

ifofct,PASSED Certified Developer Associate Exam (DVA-C01) with 924/1000 and no prior AWS experience. Here's what I did.,"I am so happy with this result. I passed the exam with 924 which was far from my expectations.

I had no prior experience with AWS. I am currently a student in college, but through an internship I learned about AWS and decided to learn it for a future internship. I learned that a certification without experience is not worth much, but nevertheless thought it would be a testament to the things I learned in summer and also would motivate me to learn about all the different AWS services on my own.

I studied for 2 weeks and it was somehow sufficient. However, 1 week of this was pretty intense study.

I took the exam on PearsonVUE. My first scheduled exam got canceled because I had a blank screen when the exam was supposed to be released (IMPORTANT NOTE: THEY WILL TELL YOU TO KEEP YOUR PHONE AWAY FROM ARMS REACH, BUT THEY WILL TRY CALLING YOU IF YOU'RE FACING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. This is something I didn't know, so my phone was on silent. After they tried calling 15 times, they canceled my exam and I rescheduled for 5 hours later). I did end up scheduling again.

The resources I used were-

Maarek's Udemy course (must have) 
Jon Bonso tests (must have)
Maarek's exams (not so much as must have, but if you want practice, it's a good choice)


Let me tell you that I did not do well on my first few practice tests. The first 2 I failed with 66-69 score. It was demotivating but I kept going with all the other practice tests and I was able to pass on all of them even if it was marginally so.y highest score on a practice test was 83%. Unlike a lot of the advice I saw here, I did not retake any of the other tests. I find that extremely counter productive. Instead I go through all my mistakes and note them down on  a cheatsheet that I revise right before the exam with one important sentence per mistake.

Regarding the exam itself, it was very easy compared to the Jon Bonso tests. 4-5 questions were pretty much same to some of the questions in Bonso's. Important topics were Cognito and Lambda. Cognito was by far the most tested topic imo. Almost a quarter of my exam was just Cognito, so learn that perfectly. 

Feel free to ask me any other questions in the comments and I'll try my best to answer

I took Stephane's course on udemy and really enjoyed it, this took me about 10 days to finish.  I feel like it was a nice kickstart to my studies.   I immediately took the practice tests in his course and scored 67%, but didnt spend the time to really study my notes.  This was more of a baseline of what information i absorbed.   I bought Bonso's practice exams and am scoring 60% on the review questions.  I also purchased Adrian's course to further strengthen my weak areas.  So far I am loving it.

i am continuing to do the practice questions and am slowly getting better scores, but everytime i miss a question i feel defeated or lose motivation. i feel like im not retaining enough information.

During covid, i spend around 5-6 hours a day watching lectures and doing practice exams.  On top of my day job + wife and kids lol.

I failed all **Jon Bonso**'s practice exam on the first try but the 2nd try, I passed them all with 90%+. It was definitely harder than I thought but the **Jon Bonso** practice exams and **Stephane Maarek** courses were essential for me to pass

Gotta give my thanks to this community for recent exam feedback and general tips on passing this exam. 

**What's covered in Exam**

KMS, DynamoDB, S3, EC2, ElastiCache, ECS or ElasticBeanstalk deployments strategies, lots of Serverless questions and lots of IAM roles based questions on accessing AWS resources. Kinesis, SQS and Cognito questions were on there too but not as much.

There was X-Ray questions but it wasn't as detailed as the practice exams

Surprisingly, no questions on RCU or WCU calculations

Again, KMS is a must to go over and even the practice exams IMO wasn't enough to cover the questions on the exam. Stephane Maarek's course covered the gaps. 

**Tech Background**  

Developing for over 10 years backend mainly in Java and recently in Golang. Last 5 years was with REST API design and development. Familiar with CI/CD process already with Jenkins, Travis and Cucumber framework. And spent 2 years working with AWS, mainly on EC2, Cloudformation, S3, RDS, ElastiCache, Cloudwatch

I also passed the Solution Architect Associate exam last year (SAA-C01)

Given all of these skillsets, there was maybe 40% on what was covered in the exam preparation

**Preparation** 

Used aCloudGurus last year while studying for the SA Associate exam but work and family priorities got in the way and I kinda left it the back burner until this summer. 

After going through most of the aCloudGuru content, went ahead with the **Jon Bonso** practice exams and did not passed all 4 practice tests on the first try. After going through each question whether it was right or wrong, all of my second attempts was over 90%+ 

Doing the exams made me realize I need to cover some more materials in detail (specifically KMS, X-Ray, ECS, Cognito and DynamoDB) so I got the Stephane Maarek courses on Udemy and that was the key part to helping me understand confidently and passed the exam

I basically started studying again the last 3 weeks of the exam, I can only spend 1-3 hours a day as I'm working and taking care of kids and started to study late at night. 

**Exam Day**

Did the Pearson Vue test at home and I thought it was smooth sailing for the checkin process. I did start preparation 30 minutes before the exam which I had to take photos and show my workstation that my desk was clear. 

I did get a message from them for reading out loud the questions so I had to keep quiet.  

Hopefully my experience helps with anyone studying for the exam and even for an experience developer like myself found this exam difficult. For anyone with kids, it's definitely do-able but expect alot of late nights.

Good luck!",33,awscertifications,2020-10-13
iffpma,Data Engineering or Site Reliability Engineering more achievable with AWS certifications?,"For context, I'm going for SAA and CDA within the next month, and I have a strong inclination to take the Data Analytics cert because I'm interested in Data Engineering, but in the short term I could potentially get the DevOps cert, which has a theoretically lower ""required"" amount of experience to take, which implies it may be better for someone working on getting an entry-level job. Any advice on which path to take JUST bast on salary and abiltiy to attain a position with just the certifications and projects? (Python/SQL/AWS related projects)

if2ald,Cleared SysOps + all associates,"Yesterday I completed the SysOps exam, giving me all 3 associate certifications

Preparation:

A few hours a day going through different courses and practice exams.

I started my journey going through Adrians SAA course. I honestly think that this is the best course that I could have done. I don't work in AWS, nor did I have any cloud experience. (Although I had a CS degree which may have helped). Adrians course gets you up to speed and his real-world examples really helped me understand the concepts, rather than trying to memorise different services.  

I studied for around a month and then took the SAA and just barely passed with a score of 72.5%. I think this exam was more a mental battle honestly, it had been quite a few years since I had done an exam and this was more to prove to myself that if I put in the work that I can do it and with getting set up on the Pearson onlineVUE definitely unsettled me.  I think if that one question had went the other way I may never had started my cloud journey. Also I'd highly recommend JB's exams, they are really the gold standard for preparing for these exams.

So I had just barely passed the SAA and went onto the Developer exam. This time I studied Stephanie's course and I did a bit more exam practice, really focusing on exam technique and how to answer questions and for this one, all you need is JB's exams honestly. They were fantastic. I cleared up this one with 91%, much better than I did done in the SAA which was a confidence boost. In terms of difference, if you did Adrians SAA course you already have like 60-65% of the knowledge already and you just need to skip to the right lectures. You can clear this one up in a week if you put in the work.

Next was the SysOps. I studied Stephanies course for this, which again was great and really helpful. In terms of shared knowledge again, you can probably get a solid 50-60% on this exam without any prep, just from the 2 other associates. I highly recommend you get them first before you do the SysOps as it has a few questions which can be tricky. I had originally planned to sit this the previous week, but had technical difficulties so I had to wait another week to sit it which threw me off as I had already started my DevOps professional preparation, and having to come back to it felt weird. 

In terms of difficulty, the SysOps is the hardest, it has several questions in which you really need to know the services like Service Catalog inside out, and honestly some of the courses and exams don't even cover parts. I think on it's own, this exam is not so difficult but with how good the practice exams are for the other exams and how, I wouldn't say poor but they are certainly not the same standard for this one. It can make it a little difficult, and this is why having the other 2, or even a professional one can really help, as there are a lot of people posting that they have failed this one. In terms of practice exams, JB should get you a pass but I really would recommend focusing on the white papers and the services themselves rather than practice exams for this one.

So to sum up difficulty:

Deveoper was the easiest with, SAA 2nd hardest (But again I was very new to cloud so if this is your first exam and you don't get it, don't give up. Spend a few more weeks on the content and you'll get it for sure. Check out Adrians course if you are new to Cloud), then the SysOps exam (768/1000)

In terms of SysOps topics:

* Make sure you know Cloud formation inside out (Which you should after the Developer exam) Make sure you know about nested stacks and stack sets, and change sets. Had a question on Drift Detection, I know this isn't covered so make sure you know what it is
* AWS Config: what it is, use cases.
* AWS Personal health dashboard, saw a question on this come up.
* Quite a few KMS questions, I would really recommend the white papers to make sure you have a solid understanding of KMS and how CMK / Key rotation policies work
* AWS systems manager. - Patching etc
* AWS service catalog - One weird question which I don't think is covered in any course or any exams, what happens if the 1st Administrator shares a Catalog  to another admin and it's imported, what happens, and what can they do.
* AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Inspector. (Pretty standard and if you have cleared the other 2 then this will be easy)
* VPC endpoint use cases
* VPC subnetting rules
* EC2: what is the difference between reboot and turn on-off - I did see a question on should you reboot or turn on-off an EC2 instance to get it on a new host, and honestly I didn't know the answer so make sure you know this
* AWS Cost explorer + tag management - Few questions on tags, just look for key words like forecast
* Access logs: ELB vs ALB vs CloudFront vs VPC flow logs, use cases, quite a few questions on this too.

You can get all of the associates cleared up in around 2 months, even if you are completely new to cloud. 

As I had already started the DevOps preparation I'm going to get back to that, and then clear up the SAP, then do some side projects and see where it takes me!",59,awscertifications,2020-10-13

iebhf3,Passed AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) Last Week !!!,"Passed AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) last week after a long preparation :) Thank you, Ryan, ACG, and Jon Bonso's practice tests!!!

By far, I must be the one with the longest journey to this certification...

**My Journey to AWS SA Associate;**

1. Actually started my prep in 2018 (Got Ryan's Udemy course in promotion). Prepared for a few weeks but lost interest (in my defense, I blame Netflix and Prime - Altered Carbon, Person of Interest, DC, Marvel, Lucifer, Punisher, Boys you name it... ) :)
2. Started the prep again in 2019 (Took ACG membership this time) for few weeks and again lost interest... (in my defense, again I blame Netflix and Prime for new seasons of Lucifer, Witcher, Punisher, The Boys, and so many)
3. Finally, resolved to start the journey again in 2020 and see it completed this time. I prepared for a few weeks but this time I booked the exam but COVID happened and the exams got canceled.

\*\*\* So took a break for some time and restarted by late July and took the example Aug mid. Made sure I book the exam this time through PSI so I don't lose my traction \*\*\*

The first time it was just watching Ryan's course videos. But, 3rd time, I watched the vids and practiced it myself. I also was working on the AWS environment in my client environments as well so that gave me good familiarity and experience in some of the areas.

**ACG Course + Jon Bonso's Practice Test**

* SA ACG course was quite relevant and sufficient (There may be some outliers in the exam I guess - But, good practice and a solid understanding of the concept will take care of it). Helped me with concepts very well...
* Jon Bonso's test was great... Helped me identify my weak areas and it covered many areas not covered in vids and helped on the concepts a lot.

**Before the exam, I prepared the following way;**

1. Watched the ACG vids in 1.3x - 2 wks (July 3rd Week to Aug 1st week) -
2. ACG Vid + Practice (3+ hrs every day)
3. Re-watched the vids in 1.3x again (Aug 2nd Week till Exam) - 1+ Week
4. ACG Vid + ACG Chapter Test + 1 Jon Bonso Test + Practice (4+ hrs every day - I did the VPC lab - and oh, I am so glad I did)

This 3+ weeks was hardest and got mentally tired by the end of this before the exam...

**My Exam Tips:**

1. VPC is a must. Make sure you can create it by heart (Thanks to Ryan for mentioning this).
2. Make sure all the exam tips are understood well and memorized for each of the topics.
3. I didn't read FAQs or Well-Architected Framework though (But it is better to read and note it down).
4. Since the answers are multiple-choice read the question clearly and eliminate the obviously wrong answers quickly

**Next steps:**

See I am an Application Architect by profession, ideally, I want to take the SA Professional ... But, before I go there, I want to do the SysOps Administrator first to get the administration flavor into my skills as well... I am also planning to do some specialty certifications as well next...

But, this time, I definitely want to time-box my preparation for each my next certification (Let's see if I can keep up the momentum and resolve, hoping so though) and prepare thoroughly from the first time around...

All the best to all those preparing to take AWS cert exams...

ie0s4l,Changing jobs for AWS?,"Hello all, I apologize in advance for the inane questions that probably get asked a hundred times a day, but I haven't found anyone able to discuss this with me.

I've been a network administrator for 4 1/2 years now and I'm getting bored of it. As part of my WGU degree, I'm currently taking an AWS SysOps class where it's required to get AWS SysOps Admin - Associate. Based on recommendations around the web, I passed Cloud Practitioner on Monday and I'm going to attempt Cloud Solutions Architect - Associate in the next five weeks, then finish up the SysOps Admin cert course.

I've heard these certifications are valuable, in demand, and the average pay for them is about $130k/year. That number definitely perks my ears up since I'm making half that now. Can anyone give me a realistic view of what to expect if I get these AWS certs and try to find a job with them? What would be a normal job title and salary? Are there jobs throughout the country or only where the data centers are at (I'm currently in the Phoenix AZ area)?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Another question I forgot to ask, is it even viable to find a job with just Networking and AWS certs?

idzs4u,AWS Solutions Architect Associate - PASS,"I passed yesterday morning. Just saw my results were a 741. Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed in myself and feel that I could have done better. Overall I spent 9 weeks total from the day I passed the CCP to learn the material for SAA. 5 weeks to get through Adrian's SAA course, and 2 weeks getting through Stephane's SAA course. I spent 2 weeks going over Jon Bonso's practice tests and reviewing them.

This exam was NO JOKE, at least to me. There were a lot of S3, ELB, RDS, DynamoDB, SQS, and EC2 questions on my exam. I had a few FSx, Lambda, Step Functions and Aurora questions. Very few KMS and EBS. Every question was a scenario and it was just as Adrian Cantrill described on his exam prep. The questions were an amalgamation of 25% easy, 50% medium, and 25% hard. I ended the exam with 20 minutes to spare.

There were 3 questions which I was truly stumped on. I felt as if I had a pretty good grasp on everything else until I saw my score this morning. I'm thankful that I passed, but I will be reviewing the material before continuing further with my AWS education.

I would like to send A GIGANTIC shoutout to /u/stephanemaarek and /u/acantril. The both of you have developed and created an oceans worth of knowledge just on one subject of learning AWS. The content you have provided is definitely a marathon to get through. I have recommended you both to everyone on my team, to my management, and just about anyone willing to listen/learn about AWS.

If I had to provide any tips for eager learners and their future endeavors I would recommend this:

* Take the time to go through the hands-on stuff that Stephane and Adrian provide. This is something I didn't do and it would have better helped me prepare for the exam. I feel that I was able to grasp concept from the lectures, but the knowledge isn't cemented without hands-on exp.
* Do the HoL that AWS provides. Echo my statement above.
* The practice exams are a double-edged sword. They're really good to gauge your knowledge and then figure out where you went wrong, however some questions are poorly worded. I wouldn't suggest taking them more than twice since you run the risk of ""memorizing"" the answers and not truly understanding the question.
* TAKE YOUR TIME. I've put some really ridiculous goals on myself this year (I've completed VCA-DCV Foundations, VCP-DCV, CCP, SAA in less than 6 months) and you can't rush this stuff. Just enjoy the ride and you'll get there when you get there.

idsz2k,My Pearson VUE experience,"So I was scheduled to take the SAA-C02 exam yesterday. Since English is my second language, I opted for the ESL +30 minutes accommodation. It was immediately approved automatically. Only then did I realize that the only way to schedule the exam with an accommodation is by phone. By that point I had read a bunch of dreadful stories with Pearson VUE, long waits on hold, and horror scenarios of online proctored exams. So I wanted to back out of the +30 minutes accommodation, so that I could at least schedule the exam online and pay by card online like it should be done in the 21^(st) century. But there was no way to cancel that online. I had to fill out some form or make some call with AWS... WHY, AWS?

So I figured I was either going to waste time with AWS or Pearson VUE, I just sucked it up and gave Pearson VUE a call...

Indeed, after maybe 30 minutes of waiting in queue, I was finally talking to some agent. He put me through to a payment agent (another half an hour of waiting). I had to give them the card details over the phone... Thankfully my mobile banking app can generate a one-time card number for these purposes...

so we scheduled the exam. An email comes and lo and behold, it was with the regular time, no +30 extra! So I told the lady to reschedule it. She told me that I have to pay again and meanwhile she would mark the first exam for a refund and I'd receive my $150 within 10 business days... what?!

After an hour and a half the exam was scheduled. great. The day came and I sat for the exam. The proctor was 30 minutes late but whatever. He then said he would start the test and the screen went black. after a minute or two I tried opening the chat window but their OnVUE app was frozen to death. Half an hour of waiting and trying to get somebody's attention by speaking and waving in front of the camera and nothing... I could literally do nothing but press down the power button on my macbook to hard-reset it... After that the app came back and it was showing a green tick saying that my exam would resume shortly. That gave me hope. So I waited for some 20 minutes until another proctor asked me over chat how they could help me. I explained the situation and they said they would look into it for me. 30 minutes passed and NOTHING HAPPENED! the chat window just closed and I was studk again...

This was already almost 2 hours later so I decided I couldn't wait any longer because I couldn't take another 2 hours to do the exam even if it began...

So I called PVUE and was told that I have to wait for 3-5 business days until they resolve my case and that I can't schedule the exam until then...

idpw1z,Passed SAA-02 Yesterday at a Test Center,"First of all I want to thank this subreddit. I've been a lurker here for around 6 months gaining insights and picking up tips.

Backround: I've been primarily a front end/middleware/full stack web developer for more than 12 years. My only experience with AWS was briefly working with S3 back in the day when S3 was the only thing AWS offered :) I'm getting certs because I want to transition to the cloud. I setup an AWS account over 2 years ago just to play around with it but never pursued it. COVID has given me time to really think about what I want to do so what better time than now.

I passed CCP in April and planned to take SAA-C01 before the cutoff in July but life got in the way and I had to postpone my study. I took the CCP via Pearson Vue at home with online proctoring.

Unlike some, my experience was technically flawless. Test started on time, no hiccups.

Even thought it was super convenient to take the test at home I didn't like the experience. Can't really put my finger on it. Maybe it was having to re-arrange my home office so it met the test standard, I don't know but I would've preferred going somewhere and 'officially' taking the exam. I'm sure I'm in the minority though.

Anyway I was able to resume study for the (now) C02 a month ago and was surprised to find that a test center near me had re-opened when it was time to schedule the exam.

***Even though I had to wear a mask AND gloves while taking the exam*** ***I still preferred it to taking it at home.*** Odd, I know.

My study path for both certs was the same:

Going through all of the free **ExamPro** videos on YouTube for CCP &amp; SAA-C02. (***Convenient as I could go through the tutorials via my big screen tv's YT app***)

**Stephane Maarek's** Udemy course for CCP &amp; SAA-C02. (***Excellent, Excellent, Excellent***)

**Jon Bonso** practice tests for SAA-C02  (***It's true what they say, Once your scores on the Bonso tests get to the 80's the actual exam wont be hard at all***)

If I had to give any advice to someone just starting out in the cloud I would say definitely get the CCP first. #1 Some will say it's worthless and wont help you at all and thats just false. It helps your study for SAA tremendously. #2 I read a lot of posts where people said it was super easy and that's also false. It's not a cakewalk. It gives you experience taking a REAL AWS test. (*plus you get 1/2 off your next test when you pass it*)

Next up for me is Developer Associate and either Security or Database Specialty (maybe both)

- 20 questions, 35 minutes, $20  
- I used Pearson/Vue
- It's @ home.  
- No Camera/Proctor/monitoring
- No special software, it's just a website  
- At the end, they tell to check ""email &gt; site &gt; multi tab link maze"" to get your score.  
- You can pay for it and start it immediately. Used my Visa, no problems. Worked as expected.  
- At the end, they tell you percentages of topic strengths you got right and wrong. It doesn't show you the answers.
- At the end of the exam, exiting the review mode is badly worded and has an un-intuitive design. It sounds like you're cancelling the entire exam. At the end, after you review your questions, yes, you click the bottom left button.

AWS Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams - John Bonso

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certified - 4 Certifications - BackSpace Academy

&amp;#x200B;

First off BackSpace, for what it's worth was not terribly good. The guy seemed to 'blow-n-go' across topics. I mean it's a damn sight better than nothing but I wouldnt write home about it. And (like ACloud Guru) the description says they update constantly but as per my email to Udemy, there is no way to prove that.

The [ACloud.Guru](https://ACloud.Guru) material was a bit better, I got annoyed by how teh Aussie pronounced things like 'router' and when he's talking about any networking aspect he says it A LOT!  Thats minimal though, the materials good, and the labs are accurate.  Compared to the exam, a decent amount was missing like new offerings from AWS (Neptune and API caching for starters) which leads me to believe the material is NOT updated all the time.

The Practice exams by John Bonso I felt were too granular.. too in depth than the actual exam was.  I should not need to know deep data base details.

The company has been using AWS for a few years now and my products are finally being migrated to be a SaaS offering so prospects have been asking more details about our environment.  I have documentation to refer to, but I like to know more and not just sound like a sales person reciting buzzwords.  This is my first technology certification.

Preparation: my employer pays for Linkedin Learning so I have been using the CCP course on there for like 6 months, but it is very long and is just a bunch of random lessons by different people put into a course so the content overlapped from one trainer to another.  Then I found this sub and went ahead and scheduled an at home test with Pearson and bought the Stephane Maarek course and watched it over the weekend.

Experience with the at-home proctored test: I had read the experiences here so I knew not to mumble the questions and to have a vacant desk.  I logged in 30 minutes before my window and had a proctor within 10 minutes.

There were 2 questions that Stephane’s course didn’t prepare me for.  I forget what one of them was, but the other was about how to setup a PCI-compliant system.  The options were basically to use any service, to use PCI-compliant services and contact AWS to turn on PCI compliance, to use PCI-compliant services and not need to contact AWS to turn on PCI compliance.

Next step: maybe the analytics certification since my employer just started selling an analytics package (using Redshift and Qliksense), but that might be a little too deep for me.

1- A Cloud Guru ( [https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner) ):

Useful for the absolute bare basics but the course **REALLY** needs to be updated. There was so much content missing from the course that appeared in the exam ( for example GuardDuty). Honestly the most useful thing i got out of ACG was their sandboxes for practice.  I really hope they update it soon as I really like Ryan Kroonenburg's enthusiasm when teaching.

2- Stephane Maarek (  [https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/)  ) :

This dude is beyond amazing. I only found out about him after failing miserably at one of the practice exams ( %34) and reading up on suggestions from this reddit when all I did was study from ACG up until this point. After binging his series it cleared up A LOT of the stuff i didn't know and also taught me things that actually came up in the exam. Well worth every cent.

I was hesitant on buying this at first. But after buying it i can honestly say it was well worth it. His exams are extremely on par with the real exam in terms of how questions are asked and the structure of the questions for each topic. After failing the first 2 and going back through them I had a much better understanding on how to tackle each question thanks to his extremely detailed answers and then was scoring %80 on the rest and %90+  on the final.

2- Niel Davis  ( [https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-c/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-c/) :

These questions are hard. Like really hard. Way harder than the actual exam. It was really good to get this exam though for final practice as the questions were tricky and really made you think. By the end of it I was barely scrapping %80 on his exams but it helped me with some of the tricky question in the exam.

I am planning to take Solution Architect exam in near future, as I am nearing to the end of my studies and focusing on practice tests. Here are the options and situations I have.

\- I have checked PSI and Pearson Vue testing centers. PSI's testing centers have very limited options in terms of number of centers as well as timings. 

\- I chose Pearson Vue testing center becuse a. The available testing center is  nearer to where I live compared to PSI center and b. It has more timing options and more days available closer to my intended date.

\- At home Pearson Vue testing is also an option but I was not thinking that because the internet at my home lately is not as reliable, I had more than three unplanned outages in last week. Also my laptop's microphone is not upto the mark. The only thing where I don't have to worry about is power backup of my laptop which can easily last till 3 hours.

iayubg,Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam and Online Proctoring,"Yesterday on August 15th, I took the CCP exam and passed it with a score of 882. I'm very happy with my results, but I'd like to give my opinions on taking the test online, as I'd consider it one of the most stressful and frustrating online examination experiences I've ever experienced.

To start off, I'd like to say that the exam itself was very easy if you prepare for it properly. I used ACloudGuru's 2020 CCP course, and a bundle of 6 Udemy practice tests. I'm not sure if i'll use Udemy for the SAA, and instead use the Joe Bonso(Spelling?) exams.

To prepare to take the CCP exam online, I went out and bought myself a new webcam. It's a logitech camera that has 720p resolution. I figured this resolution would be more than enough for the exam, but boy was I wrong. The initial setup with the proctor was horrifically stressful. I did the whole ""Show your room"", ""Show your second monitor is unplugged"", ""Show this"", and ""Show that"".

Everything went smoothly until I had to take a picture of my ID. Well, my webcam apparently wasn't high enough resolution to take a clear picture of my ID. I took a picture. Rejected. Another picture. Rejected. Moved my lamp. Picture. Rejected. This happened about 20 times before I was then allowed into the examination window. At this point, I did the same things I did previously. Showing my room and whatnot, until the Proctor asked if he could see my ID. ""Too blurry, cant read the name"". Instant stress. ""Can you show the ID closer?"", ""Farther?"", ""Show the expiration date"". This took some time, but eventually I was allowed to take the test. I guess they just felt bad that my webcam was so blurry?

After that stressful situation, I started taking the exam. BOOM. Popup window stating my head wasn't in the center of the camera AND you only have 15 seconds to fix it or you forfeit the exam. Small red circles, big red circles, then it turns green after some fiddling and it goes away. This happened at least 100 times during the exam. Bringing a popup window, making me concentrate on webcam positioning and keeping my head literally as still as I can be, while trying to not move my head to look at the test questions on my ultrawide monitor that happen to be on the far left border of my screen.

All in all, I probably would not recommend taking AWS exams through the online proctoring unless you're determined to do it and are prepared to sit like a statue for an hour or more. I will be taking my SAA in person as I feel a regular test environment would be much more comfortable and does not require such intense concentration on things other than the actual exam questions.

At least I passed! :D",2,awscertifications,2020-10-13

iatgao,Online Proctoring Issues &amp; AWS SysOps Preperation,"Hi Reddit, 

I was recently booked in to sit my AWS SysOps exam on friday, unfortunately I faced a hiccup with Pearson Vue online proctoring and found myself on the ""you are almost done with the check in process"" page for 45 minutes before deciding I was fed up (this seems to be a regular occurance). I've submitted a reschedule request but the earliest I will be able to sit the exam will be 5 working days. 

I guess there is a light as I have 5 more days to prepare, however, I'm achieving &gt;93% on every Jon Bonso practice exam so I don't feel like i'm learning much and no longer see the benefit as I have ran through the tests 3/4 times. I have also completed the likes of the ACG and SM courses on Udemy. 

So the lingering question is despite this hiccup, is there any new/fresh/useful material I can study to better prepare for the exam, has anybody done further study that they can recommend? I know the usual Whitepapers/ FAQs but I do find them quite dry unless somebody can really advise one from personal experience? 

For reference: I have SAA, currently have no work experience in AWS however the SI I work for is currently planning a multi-cloud migration for our client (hence the certifications - better to 'show' I want experience with AWS, rather than just 'say' it).

I thought I got a higher score since the exam was easier compared to my practice exams. To study I just used the Jon Bonso + Stephane Exam till I get 93-100% consistently without thinking about it.
I took a month to go through the ACG class (In hindsight should've went with A Cantrill or Stephane as I never went back to ACG after half-assing the lectures). Then I just did 2-3 Exams a day for another month and reading what I got wrong. 

I think good proper test taking was the best for me, I can immediately tell two answers were bad off the bat so I just focus on the other two. Also really focusing on what the question is asking for and remembering patterns/word choices.

I have no prior AWS experience so I'm excited for the next steps. Right now I want to study for my next cert(Probably Developer or SysOps) while trying to get on a aws engagement at my firm.

The short training provided by AWS is great, I would pay particularly close attention to this and do it at the end of your studying as a review. You can glean the general way AWS likes to ask about these services by what they show you in the training.

Overall, I'd say 70-80% of the exam is on Kinesis, DynamoDB, RedShift, EMR, Glue/ETL. Depending on your experience and since they recommend having an associate cert before taking a specialty exam, you should feel comfortable with things like S3, IAM, Security, Lambda. If not, just make sure you feel really comfortable with those.

And don't forget  [https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/) .

Overall this is a really cool topic and if you find it interesting, you should have no trouble going through all the above- waiting to get back my exact score!

P.S. I thought my bladder was going to burst I had to use the restroom so bad about half way through the exam (I don't know how I made it) so remember you can't leave from the proctor cam for up to 3 hours!

i96tup,Got too excited..,"So I just took my Solutions Architect Associate test. I hit submit and I got the “Congrats, you passed!”. Anyway I got way too excited and jumped out of my chair, grabbed my phone to take a pic of the screen. In the moment I COMPLETELY FORGOT they were still monitoring and the proctor popped the chat to say “Did you finish? You can’t take a picture of the result.” so I quickly replied “Yes, I apologize.”. 

Long story short my excitement of passing has been immediately replaced by anxiety that they won’t count it because of that. So I’m posting this for two reasons. First, learn from my mistakes and contain yourself at least until you can exit the test platform. Second, do y’all think they’d actually disqualify me?

EDIT: I passed! And we all learned a valuable lesson along the way.",13,awscertifications,2020-10-13
i96ivn,AWS Data Analytics exam Passed!,"  I have just passed AWS Data Analytic specialty and want to share a little tips for those who are preparing this now.

First of all, this exam was really difficult and far harder than what I thought; I felt like I would fail today and was surprised to see the result as pass in end of the exam. I will have to wait to get the score until tomorrow but I probably passed it very barely, I assume.

For me, the easy questions that I could answer than 30 second was probably less than 20-30% and another 30-40% was at least I understand what are the points of asking, medium complexity. And the rest 20-30% were very tough between a few narrowed answers and something that I rarely heard of, which means that there was one step deeper terms or things to be known.

Kinesis, Glue, EMR, and Redshift are needless to say the top cores that you will have to know almost every inch of details. Reading FAQ only is never sufficient, I would suggest to read through all documents for those four services as there were a few question even asking some APIs.

The materials that I have used are:

Udemy lesson: I would say it covers only basic of basics s not more than 30%, and the depthwise you will have to spend far more than that. But very good to get the big picture and topics to focus on. I watched it twice.

FAQs suggested in exam preparation: Read briefly for all related one, and twice for core services

Whitepapers: Have not read at all, I personally thought that it doesn’t help me that much in preparing exam. 

AWS Reinvent: I briefly watched all suggested videos, but felt not very useful as I expected. Only Kinesis and Redshift parts were what I watched many times. I was very confident that I know pretty much of RedShift in detail, but still there were something that I had to hesitate even today.

Document: Read through AWS Documents for all above core modules, after I realized the depth of the exam. I highly suggest to read all AWS documents for those core services. Especially for Kinesis, EMR, Glue, Redshift 

Whizlap exam( 2 practices): not very similar to actual exam, but it provides which level of depth to be studied. I saw someone saying that actual exam was easier than this, but it was not true for me.

Lastly, the exam readiness session was very good to finalize and sort out things and obviously I was helped a lot from there.

I also got AWS SAA this January and honestly speaking I have no exact AWS/Data analytics experience with me, I am just doing for my professional challenges and expanding my knowledge, it took me about 6-8 weeks to get.

Hope this help someone interested in Data Analytics exam and be ready to the depth of exam you will encounter.

i8rfe9,Passed my AWS SAP-C01 certifications,"I am really pleased to have passed my SAP-C01 exams, would like to share my experiences taking the exams here.

**Preparations:** I signed up for the u/stephanemaarek course on Udemy, and i watched that, I first did the first 2 practice test on u/jon-bonso-tdojo's Practice Test on Udemy, and got an average of 60% for these. I identified what are the subjects i am weak on and go through the cheat sheets on Tutorial Dojo and reviewed the videos on the subject on u/stephanemaarek.

I started doing the review untimed test of 30 random questions on Tutorial Dojo's site, and it was a hit and miss, and slowly i got better scores and tried a few rounds on the timed 75 question sets as well.  However I advice against doing that as I realised that the sets are the same as those on the Udemy course, and i will end up getting too familiar to the questions.

I saved the 2 last practice test for the week before the exams, and I got a pass on my first try for them, however as i mentioned, a lot of the questions had become too familiar because of the review and timed test on tutorials dojo.

So the night before I found the free practice exam voucher on my account and tried that instead. and to my horror, i failed that. and i really panicked. ( bad decision ) however it was too late to reschedule the exams, so nothing for me to do but show up the next day and do my best.

**The Exams:** The questions are much wordier than the ones in u/jon-bonso-tdojo's practice exams, and there were a lot you have to filter through, and the answers are much closer to each other. My strategy is to go through all the questions, and flag the ones that I am unsure of, and go back to the flagged ones after i have gone through the full test. I took around 160 minutes to go through the first round (my avg on the u/jon-bonso-tdojo test are around 90 minutes) and was left with only 20 minutes to go back to the flagged questions, and i think there were 25-30 questions flagged. not a very confident number. i only managed to go through around 7 before i was left with 1 minute. I took a deep breathe and clicked end.

**The Verdict:** Although i got a pass, but I feel I should have done better and better prepared for it. In the end, I feel i have""overfitted"" myself to the u/jon-bonso-tdojo's question. I guess the better strategy would be like the one i employed for the Associates where I did both the Jon Bonso test and the Neal Davis test? so that i don't end up getting too familiar with any one set. You can consider u/acantril, great materials for review, i only regret I found this resource too late.

Give yourself more time as this is really tough. Practice how to sieve through text and find key information to identify what the questions are really asking.

I hope this helps. and i wish the ones doing the exams Good Luck!!",13,awscertifications,2020-10-13

i7yzcr,Passed SAA-C02 with 832/1000. Here's how I did it.,"This page helped me a lot in my preparation for the exam, so I told myself I would make a post if I passed. The best piece of advice I have is to pace yourself. Don't cram and make sure you are studying for understanding and not to pass the exam. If you understand the topics well, passing the exam is a piece of cake. Now for the juicy stuff.

**Resources:**

* A Cloud Guru (ACG) SAA-C02 Course
* John Bonso Practice Tests (CRITICAL!!)
* Tutorials Dojo Cheat Sheets ([https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/))
* YouTube (Search for the service you want to learn and look for videos by Amazon, the VPC one was very helpful)

**What you need to know (not exhaustive):**

* S3 and EC2 pricing tiers
* Availability and Durability for databases and storage services
* Networking (Security, communicating with other VPCs, services, and on-prem)
* Common application designs and components (Serverless, Pub/Sub, Fan-out, etc.)
* Overall Security
* A high-level idea of less common services (Glue, Neptune, etc.)

**How I studied:**

I set aside time every day for the four weeks leading up to the exam. I started off by going through the **A Cloud Guru** course as I had minimal cloud experience before. I'd say ACG is really good to build a solid foundation, but I don't think it alone can get you to pass the exam. However, once you go through ACG you have a solid foundation to build your knowledge on. I'd say leave the two weeks leading up to the exam to **take practice tests**. Even if you haven't finished the ACG course, go ahead and take an exam to serve as a baseline. My strategy for the practice tests was to take them and mark the questions I was unsure about it. I then reviewed all the questions I had marked, even if I got them correct. I took a notebook and made a list with the topic of each question, the answer, and justification. I also made a star next to any topic I needed to review. These lists served as study guides for the next test. I continued to do this and then went ahead and redid each test. I was aiming to get 95+ on each retake and I repeated the same review process. I also referenced the **TD cheat sheets** for any topics I was unsure of. Throughout my studies, I played around with the **AWS console** for the common services and topics (S3, EC2, VPC, etc.). I redid the **big labs in ACG (VPC, Route53, EC2, etc.)** and watched the **lesson summaries** the night before the exam.

**tl;dr**

The practice exams are what get you to pass!! Build a foundation, but make sure to leave ample time to go through every question in the practice tests and really understand why the correct answer is correct.  Also, **READ THE QUESTION CAREFULLY!!!!** Make sure you know what the requirements are, low-cost, highly-available, low-latency? 

Thank you to this community for helping me pass. Best of luck on the exam and please let me know if you have any questions!",0,awscertifications,2020-10-13

1. I completed the cloud resume challenge (see: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/instructions/)

2. I made a simple Amazon Lex COVID-19 Chatbot, which used S3, several Lambda functions, RDS, and deployed it via a service called Twilio, which allows the chatbot to be accessed via SMS.

i7fyad,I just passed my Cloud Practitioner Exam!!,"
** EDIT: Looks as though I got a perfect score 1000/1000 so definitely overdid it**

This community has been so helpful in giving me recommendations and resources on how to best prepare for this exam and I just want to thank all of you! I also wanted to do a little write up on how I prepared for the exam to help others just as you all have helped me. I have zero IT experience so this certification can definitely be done without that for those like me who felt that would be a setback for them -- IT'S NOT. Here's the resources I used:

Right out of the gate, the first thing I did was go through the FREE Amazon Digital Training to grasp the content but unfortunately it was really hard for me to see how it all came together which made certain terminology hard to understand and remember so I wouldn't use this if you have no foundational clue as to what cloud computing is but it's great if you want to use it to supplement your studies once you gain a better understanding.

[https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/)

1) A Cloud Guru (PAID but has 7 Day Free Trial) - I started using A Cloud Guru and it was a tremendous help in building up that foundation along with compiling the knowledge you needed to know on top of that. Overall, great resource but I would not only use this solely. I thought I had it down with A Cloud Guru only but boy was I in for a treat once I took that practice exam at the end of the course. I made a 74% on it and was like woah, I definitely need to use another resource to understand information that was not covered. Cue where this subreddit enters...

[https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner)

2) So after exploring this subreddit a lot of people recommended Stephane Maarek course. This resource was AWESOMEEEE! I remember making a post freaking out a few days before the actual exam because I honestly thought I had most of it down with A Cloud Guru but watching Stephane Maarek 10 hour course on Udemy and man oh' man this guy is awesome a lot of the concepts really sunk in and he really explains concepts super well enough for it to stick. His course also filled in a lot of gaps in my learning as well. He really breaks down a lot of the services you'll see on the exam instead of having to read about them on the services white paper -- which I would still recommend reading them ALL.

[https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/)

This is usually on sale for like $11 or $12 bucks.

3) DigitalCloud Cheat Sheets (FREE) - These were also a great resource! I copied and pasted all the DigitalCloud cheat sheets into one word doc and used this to study and review. I'm a visual learner so I re-read the notes constantly until I understood them as a wrap-up review leading up to the exam .

4) Jon Bonso Practice Exams, TutorialsDojo Cheatsheets - I also used Jon Bonso's practice exams to test myself and was scoring mid 80's on each practice test but I used the detailed explanations at the end of each test to fill in further gaps. The exam questions were a bit harder but they will certainly prepare you for the exam and are very similar to it as well. I saw a few questions that were almost identical to the Bonso exams. It is a little more difficult but it really tests if you have well-rounded understanding of the concepts.

[https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-amazon/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-amazon/)

I don't have my scores yet but should be getting them in a few days but I was mostly sure of all my answers maybe two were a bit tricky but overall I was super prepared! Not gunna lie, I did overdo it but it's better to be over prepared than under! Overall, study time was about 3 weeks.

I was still able to talk to my Proctor and the system was still tracking my face so I couldn't move or anything. It took 20 minutes for the test to resume and I had to wait doing nothing for most of that time.During the exam while I was answering the questions the instructor told me ""Don't look outside of your screen because I can end your test at anytime"" and ""Don't move your face too much or you test may be finished"" which made me really nervous and tense the whole freaking time.

i76mfo,How or where do should I get started with AWS?,"Hello community!

Just came across this sub a few days ago and I been doing some research into various IT opportunities with growth. Just to preface, I have a degree in Management Information Systems from FAU and I currently work at law firm where I work doing in-house web development and marketing tasks for the firm. I was able to land this job through a staffing agency as at the time I just married and out of work. While this job does pay the bills there is obviously no room for growth. 

While I was school and in my degree program the emphasis of getting certifications where never really talked about nor preached about by instructors nor advisors. So, like many of the other students in my program, I never really looked into getting any while I was in school or immediately after. I now realize how big of a mistake that was. However, now I am at the point where, while my current job does pay the bills and all, I realize that there is no “celling” to break through because there is no room for growth whatsoever. I do not want to be comfortable where I am at and I want to have a career that is rewarding and has growth. That has lead me to looking at a path in AWS especially with how high demand and cutting edge it is.

I wanted to ask where or how should I start to pursue path in AWS? Should I first get a basic cert like the CompTIA or CCNA before I jump into getting a AWS cert? 

Any helpful advice will be greatly appreciated.",1,awscertifications,2020-10-13
i76jpw,Passed Solutions Architect Associate (v2) on first try -- thank you again!,"I posted \~7 weeks ago about passing my [CP exam](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/hcqxmr/passed_cloud_practitioner_exam_thanks_to_this_sub/) shortly after starting my new job at AWS (Inside Sales), and now I'm proud to share that I've also passed the SAA exam 784/1000!

This was a relatively much more challenging exam compared to CP, as it dives much deeper on CP topics and is more scenario-based rather than theory; and while I don't have any experience with v1 of this exam, popular opinion seems to be that v2 is harder lol (or maybe, more obscure due to the new services it covers?) -- plus as work responsibilities started to build up, it took me longer to finish studying and had to juggle more.

Anyway, per this sub's recs, I switched it up from Cloud Guru (which I used for CP) and instead bought u/stephanemaarek's Udemy course + his bundle of 3 additional practice tests (both were on massive sale due to a discount code Stephane provided). I did also drill practice tests from Cloud Guru, Linux, and WhizLabs (just the free ones here) -- I found it super helpful to rotate drilling practice tests from different providers to get as much exposure as possible to various topics &amp; question types.

Stephane's course was extremely well done, blending theory + hands-on labs to reinforce -- but ultimately, much of the exam's success depends on your ability to properly interpret the questions and pick out common pitfalls/tricky wording + keywords that indicate the right answer. There were a dozen questions about topics I hadn't seen before (or were under-emphasized and thus I forgot lol), but I was able to eliminate at least 1 or even 2 answers just based on reading the question carefully -- guessing with 50/50 odds is still a big leg-up!

My role doesn't need any more certifications at this point, but I miiiight aim for another one in the near-ish future (depends on if I have the time + can make a business case for expensing yet another course/exam lol). Popular opinion seems to be Developer Assoc next, and then SysOps Assoc? I feel like for those two, I need actual hands-on work experience vs. just studying, and I'm a total cloud noob who's only 3mo into this AWS job.

Feel free to DM me with specific q's about the exam and/or applying to AWS! And thanks again for everyone's contributions to this sub, and of course all the instructors out there who put so much time into crafting excellent courses/practice tests!

Finally after months of studying and trying to get EBS volume types straight, I've passed my exam and got the cert.

I originally started studying in February this year, and completely finished LA's course just about the same time testing centers closed down because of the pandemic.  Then, AWS changed the exam to the C02 and after a few months of being in limbo, I sat back down and re-studied.

Shoutout to Cantrill for his updated course material at  [https://learn.cantrill.io/](https://learn.cantrill.io/) .  His courses on LA and later on with his own platform filled in most of my current knowledge of AWS.

Another shoutout to Bonso, his practice exams are really nice and fill in a lot of feature specific details and is good for the 2-week out exam prep.

One thing I should mention to the various instructors/guides out there.  The AWS exam I took leaned heavily on use case scenarios where multiple answers ""could be"" used but I had to choose ""the best"".

I took 5 practice exams. I ended up in the early 60% in my first attempt. Recognized my weak areas, worked towards it by focusing on explanations, learning it visually on Neal Davis' training course.

\- Lot of storage questions ( S3, S3 IA, S3 IA-One Zone, EBS, EFS, FSx for Windows)

\- Database questions related to HA, HPC and Scalability (RDS, Dynamo DB)

\- No questions on bastion host

\- 5-8 questions on Autoscaling with EC2 instances

One question that is still bothering me that I got wrong was about developing an application where the client wanted a recommendation for the best AWS service to store both data and session cache. I chose Amazon RDS. I debated ElastiCache Redis, but decided RDS, although slower, would be my recommendation. 

The correct answer, according to the practice test results, was ElastiCache Memcached, with an explanation that it offers both object level and application level storage. My mind is pretty blown by that. Especially as a developer for 20+ years, I would never recommend memcached over Redis, and in particular, never as a single place for both application data and session data.

What am I missing? What does object level storage in Memcached look like? I’ve never even heard of such a thing, and I would be horrified if I came into an organization of any size using Memcached for their primary data store. I swear that answer was simply incorrect.

I have completed the course on Udemy by Ranga.
He is new to this. But I have done some courses by him previously on Java. He is easy to listen to.

On recommendation of Jayendra Patil's blog, I Signed up for a brain cert practice exams.
Although I learn a lot from the practice exam its just too difficult and confusing. 
I pause the exam and refer aws docs for each questions. Thats how I learn and Ive improved a lot since.
I find the the braincert practice questions extremely difficult and confusing. They are all scenario based.
Sometimes I wonder whats point. In real life we would probably debate a lot before making a design decision.
There is a lot of ambiguity in the questions. Is this level of difficulty even transferable as a skill for my actual job?

My question is : Is braincert practice tests too much for the actual test and I need to take it easy if I dont do well on it?
Is the Jon Bonso questions easier?",5,awscertifications,2020-10-13

i5knkz,Passed AWS Certified Developer Associate exam today! 1st Try!,"Today I passed the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam on the first try!  This is my 3rd AWS Cert as I already earned my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certifications.  The DVA-C01 exam seemed easier than the SAA-C02, but that may be because I have studied extensively for both over the past year.  (600+ hours for SAA-C01/SAA-C02, 200+ hours for DVA-C01).  Also I’ve been working daily as a Senior Systems / Cloud Engineer in AWS GovCloud.

Here is what I used for studying.  A Cloud Guru - Good Intro of Material, but the practice tests are not even close.  Linux Academy - Decent videos, great labs, practice questions meh.  Whizlabs - Decent videos, practice questions ok.  Udemy - Great videos, not the best worded practice questions.  digitalcloud.training - Great Videos, absolutely spot on for practice questions.  I was hitting 90-95% of all the practice questions on digitalcloud.training and I passed the DVA-C01.  The same goes for the SAA-C02, use digitalcloud.training and you will pass!

But the thing is, even if you don't think you can do something because it is hard, keep going.

i5hl79,"Finally got all 3 Associate certs - Do not underestimate SysOps exam, it is HARD! Barely passed yesterday.","At the beginning of covid lockdown I made a goal for myself to stay productive and wanted to achieve all 3 associate level certs + cloud practitioner where I started with zero AWS knowledge.

After 4 months of study and testing I finally achieved my milestone goal.   Yesterday I barely passed SysOps.

To give an idea how much harder it was, here are my test scores:

- Cloud Practioner - ~850
- Solutions Architect - ~880
- Developer - ~940
- SysOps - 735


I literally think I passed by 1 question.  For future people going this route, do not underestimate the SysOps test.  

Everyone says there is a lot of overlap from SAA, and its true but the questions are way harder and more unclear as to what the answer could be.  Many questions from using the technique to eliminate definitely wrong answers - I had alot of questions where I was between 2 answers that sounded correct. On the SAA and developer test, I knew for sure one of the answers was correct.

The overlap comes in basically understanding:

- Load balancing
- EC2
- Subnet
- NACL / Security Groups
- ASG

All the questions build on those foundation to ask even more about it like:

- How to get the correct logs, and where
- Calculating CIDR
- Private vs Public traffic
- NAT gateway / instance / VPN
- How to solve latency / performance issues

Many questions covering CloudFormation scenarios were asked

Many questions involving AWS organizations / SCP / passing roles / assuming roles were asked


TLDR:

Yes, there is overlap for SAA, not much for Developer.  Understanding lambda is enough.
Do not go into this test thinking just cause you passed SAA, you will do well.  There is a ton of other stuff asked.
The questions for SysOps were more problem solving based.  SAA and developer were more fact based.

Resources I used: 
The usual combo: 
Jon Bonso tests + mareek course.

For now, I am done with certs!  Originally was going to get SA pro but decided against it until I get an actual AWS job lol.  I currently am a full stack dev working with React/node and LAMP stack stuff.  I figured since cloud is the future, might as well get on the train.",78,awscertifications,2020-10-13

As the title said I did on second attempt. I studied using whizlabs only for my first attempt it has very good practice exams and course. However this was not enough to pass the exam, at least for me. I was getting 80% to 85% on all the practice exams. I did the official practice exam SAA-P02 by free thanks to the coupon I got for passing the Practitioner exam last year, this P02 has questions very very similar to the real exam, consist on 20 questions and you have 30 minutes to accomplish, this practice exam do not give you the answers, however it let you know your areas of weaknesses of the 4 different categories, in my case my weakness was on developing “high performance architecture” and “cost-effective architecture” both covers a lot of diff topics/products. I got 60% on that practice exam, with this result I should have reschedule my exam, however I was anxious and can’t wait any longer and I decided to took the C02 exam and I Failed the first attempt getting 700, very close but is not a passing score. I studied for other 3 weeks the same exams of whizlabs giving a second round to the exams, this time I was getting 90% and I was reading all the explanation whizlabs gives telling why the answers are incorrect or correct, this helps me quite a LOT, also I read the white papers of the 4 different architecture topics that comes on the C02 exam, which I think was the clue to solve mi stupid tiny mistakes, in addition, I also decided to read the FAQ of many products like S3, Lambda, CloudFront, SQS, Kinesis, VPC and storage gateway. And finally I passed my exam, not sure yet the score since it last some days to give you your score, they just tell you on the moment if you Fail or if you Pass.

Some of the topics that cames a lot on my first attempt where Kinesis, SQS, VPC, lambda, Global Accelerator, CloudFront, FSx and Storage Gateway, and a bit of WAF, EC2 and S3.

On my second attempt it cames a lot of DataSync, Storage Gateway, Snowball, FSx, Global accelerator, S3, some of EC2 and CloudFront finally a bit of lambda SNS, SQS and kinesis.

I finished my first exam attempt 50 minutes earlier, which makes me think that I spent very few time on every question, and that may was my mistake.

On the second attempt I finished the exam 10 minutes earlier which makes more sense why I passed the second one.

I’m a person that usually forgot what I did yesterday, so in my case it helps me to take notes of the important details like, which services do not need to pass over internet, which ones does, difference between very common products like Global Accelerator vs CloudFront, VPN vs site-to-site VPN, which servicse includes AWS SHIELD for DDOS attack, FSx windows server vs FSx Lustre etc...


I strongly recommend to read the FAQ of the products I mentioned before and White papers of the  architectures, believe me, is the key to pass the exam, do not assume! Consider all the possible scenarios, in my case this 2 last frases solved my problem.

Hope this helps!

i3rq8n,Passed SAAC-02!,"My background is in industrial design &amp; B2B sales, so I had virtually no IT or comp sci/programming knowledge. I spent 4 weeks (to the day!) prepping with Adrian Cantril’s course, Jon Bonso’s exams, and a few direct AWS resources.

I spent a lot of time going through Adrian’s course which was incredible for foundational level information. Entered his course with literally zero knowledge and felt pretty confident after completing it. His material was super thorough and in-depth. I took about 2.5 weeks (~8-10hrs/day) on that.

I went into Bonso’s exams expecting a fair level of difficulty, but feeling prepared enough. Ended up with a 37% on my first one, so that was a swift kick to the face. I think subsequent grades were like 55 / 58 / 63? Really just a continuous stream of ego blows there.

Neither Adrian or Jon’s material on their own would’ve been enough for me on their own, but together they’re a great mix of exam/theory knowledge and working AWS skills. They’re both extremely robust resources packed with all of the information you need, but you’re only going to get out of them what you put in.

I also took the AWS practice test, mostly to gauge Bonso’s relative difficultly, but that proved to be completely useless and I zero percent recommend it. If you have $20 you just *need* to spend, Venmo it to me instead.

One of the best ~and free~ resources I found was the SAAC exam prep offered by AWS directly. It’s ~2 hours long but has brief review modules of all exam material and video walk throughs of sample questions. It’s a great comprehensive review of the actual exam material, helped me identify my gaps. Definitely worth walking through the night before/day of your exam if possible.

I thought that the exam itself was actually on par with Bonso’s difficultly level and was v thrilled to find it more difficult than I was expecting. A lot of seemingly strange material came up, several questions about DataSync, Redshift and two about EMR. I didn’t have anything about Elastic Beanstalk, which I thought featured pretty prominently on Bonso’s exams. Unfortunately enough, there weren’t really any questions that I felt like I could just “breeze” through. There were a solid 5-6 about S3 that were surprisingly tricky, too. I found that there’d be one key word that popped up in the question that I needed to go back and reference to pick between two answers that could, theoretically, be correct.

Going forward with my odd mix of skills and experience and now my prized certification, I have a few interviews for sales engineer lined up and have my fingers crossed that someone wants to employ me before this expires in three years.

I know this has been a long post, but I would be remiss if I didn’t take a moment to give a special shout out to Pearson Vue for being so exceptionally horrible. I waited 93 minutes for a proctor, then got booted out because of a problem with my “facial identification” (next time I’ll be sure to wear MAKEUP for my virtual exam, dicks). I had waited so long for a proctor that by the time they told me about the issue, my entire exam session had expired and they made me reschedule for another day, at 7am. V rude.

Wanted to let you know that I passed my AWS CCP exam yesterday! I received a 908 which I was very happy to see as it shows that my way of studying was good and I’ll keep it going forward.

Big big thanks to u/neal-davis for his CCP course on Udemy and u/jon-bonso-tdojo for the practice exams. The test was harder than I thought it would be but this material definitely had me feeling confident going into it! For anyone who wants to know I studied for 6-8 weeks and primarily used these two things as my main source of study. I did skim the whitepapers but pretty much everything from there was already in my study material.

My next step is to now dive into the Solutions architect associate cert. Can anyone provide me with what they’ve used in order to study/pass this exam? It would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

I enrolled in a local college last year for an associate's program in front end development. After a ""Cloud for Developers"" class that glossed over some of the AWS services, I decided to chase this cert over the summer as a sabbatical from coding.

I studied for about a month beforehand using the acloudguru course and it helped me tremendously. If I was going to give any advice, I'd say gloss over the whitepapers as well as there are a few points the lectures don't cover, but can be found in several other free practice exams on the web.

On that point, DO THE PRACTICE EXAMS. The ones covered in acloudguru's course and the free one AWS offers are very good practice. I would say about half of my understanding settled in when I reviewed my incorrect questions from these practice tests. It really solidified my idea of how the services work/tied together.

I plan on continuing to use the acloudguru course for the SA exam and hopefully take that before school starts back up.

So I've been preparing and studying for my CCP exam for this Friday and I felt like I had a good grasp of the concepts using ACloudGuru, Stephane Maarek's videos, and white papers. After watching ACloudGuru I made a 74% on their practice exam without having read the white papers and only just from what I remembered directly from the course. Stephane's videos helped me dive in a bit deeper and get a more well-rounded knowledge of the material.

So, at this point I am taking Jon Bonso practice exams and I'm a little worried. On the first exam, I made an 84% and the second 74%. It seems these practice exams dive in a little deeper than the practice quizzes and exams I've taken thus far and feel like I have to further study using the TutorialDojo cheat sheets. I've got two more practice tests to go but am planning on using the rest of the few days to study the cheat sheets. My question is are the Bonso tests made to be harder than the actual exam?

I was expecting to go so well (like 90%+) in the Stephane tests (I failed in the cost pillar in the two tests that was my worst part). I was expecting to have hard moments with Jon Bonso.

My questions are:

1 - This study plan is too much (like killing ant with bazooka)? is there something in that study plan I should not do (maybe acg tests?) ?

2 - Should I take a third course like the one from Adrian or should I only retake Stephane course one more time?

3 - Any suggestions on how to study?

I am studying for the SAA-CO2 and plan to take the exam around Sept time frame.

I have 15-20yrs of storage and IT background, so some parts are easier for me than other.

I didn’t have much cloud experience hands on, but the concepts are not new nor surprising to me, as well as many services.

I first went through the entire CCP course and SAA course in ACloud Guru.. don’t think it was a waist of time, but for sure not a good use, learned it from here after already was half way through.

I thank took the Stephan.M SAA course. Just finished. Mainly listen and watch, less hands on this time.

For sure more in depth. Some concept are better well burned in my head now,  while others are still some of a mesh in my head..

I am considering how spend my time in August and what’s the best way to spend my time (1-2hrs daily):

plan to take an exam test from the course just to checkpoint myself.

What would be good to do now?
1- start practice exams ? Or is it too early ?
2- go over FAQ of various service where I need I feel to be stronger ?
3 - take labs via quiklabs ? Play with building ?
4 - go over course sections all over again ?

i2hdfk,Passed my SAA-C02 exam," 

When I started with AWS, I was completely new and had 0 knowledge of AWS. 

To begin with, I started my journey with ACG course on udemy. It is a good course for beginners. 

Then I jumped to [**u/stephanemaarek**](https://www.reddit.com/user/stephanemaarek/) **and** [u/jon-bonso-tdojo](https://www.reddit.com/u/jon-bonso-tdojo/). These courses are MUST WATCH if you want to clear the exam. Both the courses cover every detail that might come up in the exam. I have watched [**u/stephanemaarek**](https://www.reddit.com/user/stephanemaarek/) course at least 3 times and took [u/jon-bonso-tdojo](/user/jon-bonso-tdojo) practice tests 3 times. MAKE SURE TO WRITE DOWN THE IMPORTANT POINTS TO READ ON THE DAY OF THE EXAM. 

I also referred to [u/jon-bonso-tdojo](https://www.reddit.com/u/jon-bonso-tdojo/) cheatsheet. 

My final scores for [u/jon-bonso-tdojo](https://www.reddit.com/u/jon-bonso-tdojo/) were:

1 - 74, 2 - 75, 3 - 75, 4 - 73, 5 - 77, 6 - 72

**On the day of the exam(home-based):**

You are not allowed to read the question out loud or even whisper. I was corrected by the proctor 4 times during the exam. 

Topics you should know:

FSx (3 questions)

CloudFront(2-3 questions)

S3 (lifecycle and encryption) - 3-4 questions

EC2 (types - spot, on-demand etc) - 2 questions

EFS(POSIX compliant) - 2 questions

SNS (FIFO vs standard) - 3 questions  

SNS - 1 question 

(RDS vs Aurora vs DynamoDB) - 5 to 8 questions

DynamoDB stream - 1 question

Kinesis - 2questions 

Snowball and if not snowball, how will you transfer the data - 3 questions

How does the VPC work, Security group and NACL - 3-4 questions 

Placement groups - 2 questions

IAM policies(2 questions)

Most of the questions were surrounding storage.

Exam tips:

I used the method of elimination of options. When you read the options you can easily eliminate 2 of them. The remaining two are slightly difficult and for that make sure to read the question and understand what the question is asking. Do you need high availability, scalability or high performance? Once you figure that out, it will be easy to choose the correct option.

I work day to day with AWS tools, not too many on the dev or serverless side though. Felt like this was a difficult exam but not impossible. 

I saw a lot of questions about dynamo db, serverless framework, cloudformation, lambda, api gateway, S3,  and caching. Thankfully not too many api calls came up (one of my biggest fears going into the exam). 

For resources I used U/stephaneMaarek’s incredible test prep content along with Jon Bonso’s practice tests. Had used whizlabs in the past but based on the great feedback Bonso’s prep tests had received I felt like I needed to switch it up. He and Stephane definitely helped me prep for this test and get the grade I needed. 

Also need to shoutout this incredible community! I had a lot of apprehension going into this first exam being taken remotely using Pearson OnVue, but after reading about others experiences here, I began to feel  a lot more comfortable with the process. 

On that- proctor showed up right on time, sat for exam in a small room with no electronics and had prepared myself for a long wait. Proctor showed up right on time, sent the link for photo uploads and we proceeded. Almost had a hiccup when she couldn’t push the test to my work issued Mac, but after re-establishing an internet connection it worked just fine.

About the exam

The questions were a bit longer than expected. There was always a little background story in there, and the answers were sometimes longer as well. The first 20 questions took about an hour to go through and I was dreading that I didn’t ask for the 30mins extra time available to non-native English speakers. In the end, I finished with 25 mins left on the clock, so either my nerves calmed down or the rest of the questions were easier.

Main topics were:

* S3 (a few on lifecycle rules)
* Encryption. One of the questions even asked if we should choose between asynchronous or synchronous encryption of a database (I was like ‘whaaat?’).
* VPCs in general (connect multiple VPCs, NACLs, SGs).
* How to link premises to the cloud under a range of different scenarios.
* IAM policies (2 questions showing a JSON policy and what they allow/not a user to do).
* AWS organisations and how to manage multiple AWS accounts, grant least privileges, limit access to particular resources.

**Studying:**

I put in \~2-3 weeks of studying after work hours &amp; weekends. My studying consisted of Whizlabs exams, and reading the FAQ's and actually provisioning (as best I could) the scenarios given in the questions I got wrong. There are some sketchy free sample test questions out there, but I didn't trust the answers on those and any help regarding the answers on discussion boards were debated with no real answer or resolution. Long story long, nothing beats figuring out the answer for yourself. That's when the information really sticks.

**Background:**

4 years experience in AWS, although, working for large companies it's easy to get pigeon holed into certain areas of AWS. There are definitely areas of improvement for me in Database Migrations and Networking. I was solid on the DevOps / Security / Compute areas.

i1zxg9,Passed AWS CCP (CLF-C01),"Got my results this morning, I scored a 979 on the exam which makes me pretty happy.  

My journey started sometime last year, I was casually learning about AWS because my military unit was starting to work in the cloud and as the senior enlisted manager and resource advisor I felt I needed to understand it more.  So I started off doing some of the Amazon offered courses and getting into Linux Academy (also because I wanted to test them out as an overall training solution for my teams).  However I didn't get too serious about it until around May when I decided to apply for retirement from the military which would give me 1 year to plan on figuring out what I want to do when I grow up.

I started off with the u/jon-bonso-tdojo practice tests which let me know that I need to focus more.  I read some of the whitepapers and did the Review Mode which helped but it's not really my style of learning and something about the way Linux Academy presented their stuff made it hard for me to absorb. 
Enter r/stephanemaarek and his generous offering of his Udemy CCP course for free.  I was apprehensive at first having taken the Linux Academy one but it was free so might as well.  Best decision for me, it worked out quite well.  Before I was having troubles retaining how things fit but the way he presented worked much better for me and it stuck.  I spent about 1-2 hours a day on his course and at the end of the week I'd take another practice test or two just see where I was.  Once I got through everything, I focused on the topics that I seemed weakest on.  I rewatched the lessons on those topics, read the whitepapers from AWS and took the review mode again.  By the time I got to taking the official exam, I had gone from scoring in the 60-70% range to consistently scoring in the 85-90% area.  The morning of the test, I spent 1-2 hours focusing on the weakest areas again but focused in the technology since it's the largest part of the test.

Now that's over, I'm taking the weekend to relax, kill some brain cells and just play video games.  Next week I'll start on my next target, the Solutions Architect Associate cert!",14,awscertifications,2020-10-13

i1ulqa,Passed SA-CO2 with 752/1000. No I.T experience at all but barely scraped by. Exam was a lot harder than I thought,"Hey guys,

I passed SA-CO2 yesterday but just barely. I was studying a 1-2h every day before bed since I work a full time job and have been building ventilators at work over the last few months so it's been demanding for me.   


I have absolutely 0 I.T experience but I started off with the Cloud Practitioner back in May and passed that at the end of May. I felt that was a good introductory for people who have 0 cloud experience, and to gauge wether or not learning any of this was even worth it. The Cloud Practitioner left me hungering for more, so I decided to pursue the SA.   


I started off with Stephane Maarek's course and it was a good course then purchased Jon Bonso's tests on Udemy. I was getting 30-65% on my first round of Bonso tests but I had heard to get his tests on his website which he has quizzes that are section and service based, which helped tremendously. I purchased Adrian Cantril's course which I barely looked through tbh since time wasn't on my side, but I was planning to go through the course fully after the exam, wether I passed it or not  


I had done nearly 40-50 quizzes in total from the free online ones, to Udemy's to Bonso's. I was getting consistently 90%+ on the full practice tests on Bonso's website in the last 2 weeks so I was feeling confident for the test......or so I thought.

I started the exam and the hardest question was the first question, so my heart instantly sank and felt demotivated. I took my time and instead of wasting time reading questions multiple times on questions I was confused about, I flagged them and moved onto the next one to not waste time. I had flagged around 10 questions but only changed one answer.  


There was a lot S3 of course, quite a bit of ALB vs NLB, VPC public vs private subnets, Global Accelerator vs CloudFront and a few security questions. 

I found the exam to be much more difficult than the practice exams. There were always 2 wrong answers but the 2 possibly correct answers were very similar almost every single time which would confuse me because in most practice questions, (like Bonso's), there's always a clearly correct answer by process of elimination.

My short term roadmap is that I'm doing an online Python course since Python seems to be the preferred language out there, then to get the Developer Associate since it sounds like there's a lot of overlap with the SA and then go for the SysOps associate.   


Again, I have 0 I.T experience but if I can set aside 1-2h a day before bed after a full day of work, than anyone can. If anyone has recommendations for me for my roadmap, I'm all ears !",50,awscertifications,2020-10-13

----------------------------

Practice Tests

Jon Bonso'  [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Practice Exams](https://tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/ )

----------------------------

I'll refer to the videos as the bulleted number before the line item (see above) 

The studying took me maybe 3 weeks- start to test

I started with video #1 watching it at about 1.5x speed.
I did skip pass the ""How-To"" portions as main focus was to ""Pass the exam"" (See my disclaimer at the end)
Again, my focus was ""pass the Exam"" and know the theory, not be an expert on all sections

After I finished a section of video #1 I took the Topic Practice exam, on Bonso's Tutorials Dojo, which corresponded to the video. 
This helped me understand the material and review the materials i didn't understand. If I passed the topic tests with over 85-90% I moved on to the next topics 

Once I got through video #1 and through the topic tests I moved onto the Section tests. These are more difficult and focused/mimic on what you'd expect to see on the Actual AWS exam.

At this point for any in depth understanding I started using video #2 as I found it more cohesive the section based tests. If I missed something I would read Bonso's explanations then review from video#2.

The last week of studying....

I re-watched Video#1 at about 2x speed once or twice and did the 32 question practice tests 

After I passed the exam I started working on video #3.
Cantril's videos are even more in-depth than #2 videos and will help you for the hands on and mastery of the materials. 


-------------------

The disclaimer:

I have 12-15 yrs of IT experience, CISSP, CCNA, F5, Citrix, VMWare, SSCM, Windows/Linux server experience. So with that being said, I didn't care about learning every bit of AWS architecture. I wanted to be able to understand the services in AWS and match them to the infrastructure I already knew. So don't think everyone can just watch the videos, take a couple of practice tests in 2 weeks and pass. Understand that you'll need to really understand the services if you don't have real life understanding or experience with the non-cloud versions.",61,awscertifications,2020-10-13

i17hjj,"Passed CLF-C01, SAA-C02, &amp; SOA-C01"," Yesterday I completed The SOA-C02 exam (862), marking the complete of CLF, SAA, and SOA in one month. Below is a little write up of this trip. 

* I attend Western Governor's University which requires the SysOps Admin (SOA) for several of their degrees.
* [https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/transcript.aspx?transcript=HXPXYWF21N411HW1](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/transcript.aspx?transcript=HXPXYWF21N411HW1)
* I passed all three of these exams utilizing nothing but the material I'll list below. The material I used - I cannot recommend enough. All the instructor's are great and will definitely teach you a great many things.
* I used PearsonVue for all three exam's, and found no issues with the online proctoring. All three instances were quick and easy to get through.

I began by studying for the SAA-C02 (around the 10th of July) initially as I had heard the horror stories that SOA-C02 can be. I figured it would be a good intro into AWS as I had never worked with it before. I have a pretty robust IT background thanks to quite about 12yrs being active duty military (heavy in VmWare, Linux, Puppet, basic sysadmin stuff, etc.) and working as a software developer for about 3 years.

* I began with Stephane Maarek's Solutions Architect Course - [https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/)
   * This course is fantastic if you're new to AWS. I studied, followed along and completed this course in it's entirety. There is one caveat to it that I'll get to below.
* AClougGuru's Solutions Architect course was used to supplement the information learned above. Topics that I was a little unsure of, or didn't quite understand Stephane's description - I went here.
   * [https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
* I follow the information above with Jon Bonso's / Tutorial Dojo's practice exams. 
   * I recommend purchasing these from the Tutorial Dojo website directly, but they are available on Udemy as well. [https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/learn/quiz/4394976#announcements](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/learn/quiz/4394976#announcements)

Unfortunately, due to a self-inflicted issue with the SAA-C02 exam, I ended up scheduling CLF-C01 instead. (Don't ask me how it happened, I'm still not entirely sure.) I used nothing but the material above to pass Cloud Foundations. Immediately after being notified that I had passed it, I went ahead and scheduled my Solutions Architect exam (ended up being three days later as there wasn't much to choose from for online proctoring). During this waiting period, I touched up on the big one's I knew would be on the exam such as S3, EC2, ASG/ELB, VPN, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting notified that I had passed the Solutions Architect Exam, I moved on to studying the material for the SysOps Admin exam.

* I began with Stephane Maarek's SysOps Admin course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/)
   * This is where my first issue arose. I honestly feel like 85% of the material from this is in the Solutions Architect course. I get that they're tailored to the specific exam's, but at first glance I felt a bit cheated.
   * After taking the exam, I can say that all three exam's overlap a great deal, so that initial irritation has worn off.
* I utilized Tutorial Dojo/Jon Bonso exam's to solidify the material. [https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Exam Day

I ended up having about 45-50 minutes unused. Make sure you read the questions in their entirety and understand what they were asking you as there were several that technically had two right questions. This exam was VERY similar to the Solutions Architect Associate exam.

&amp;#x200B;

Topics:

* VPC (I cannot stress this enough)
   * What services use endpoints vs gateways
   * Subnetting rules
   * Endpoint use caes
* Cloud formation
   * Nested Stacks
   * Change Sets
* AWS Config
* AWS Organizations
   * Policies!
* Cloud HSM vs KMS
* AWS Systems Manager
* AWS service Catalog
   * Sharing between one account to another
* AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Inspector.
   * The in's and outs of what each one does.
   * Several trick questions that brought up Inspector, or made you think it would be Inspector as the answer
* Elastic Load Balancers and auto-scaling groups
   * Application Load Balancer
* EC2
   * What different actions do (terminate, reboot, etc)
* AWS Cost Explorer
   * Tags
* S3
   * Use cases of the different tiers
   * Lifecycle policies

i15zqx,What is your experience with different exam techniques and strategies ?,"I recently came across with [exam technique](https://learn.cantrill.io/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/lectures/16015227) by Adrian Cantril. I have done 5 tests by Jon Bonso  and up until now I was only marking the hard ones and coming back to these for a second round. In general it takes me a little over an hour for the first round and then I have been able to answer most of the ones in second round \[albeit with significant incorrect answers\].

I will try Cantril strategy in last of the Jon Bonso test. But I wanted to get  feedback from you all . I am concerned that there will be some time lost as there will be three passes. After all , when you look at a question  and decide if it hard or easy or  medium it does takes some time. With Cantrill method, you will be doing this twice.

On another note: When I tried to schedule the test, in English , it told me the duration is 140 minutes . That was a surprise as I have been hearing 130 minutes for 65 question. I wonder if  is due the fact that I will be taking the exam in a country where first language is not English ?

i15gs6,Passed the Dev Associate exam with 969.,"Thank you everyone for all your posts on this forum. I was able to know what material i need to use. This is my 4th cert since June and here are my learnings:

1. Udemy courses - SAA CO2

As everyone has said on here, I highly recommend Stephane Maareks course and Tutorial Dojos practice test. I made the mistake of trying to use Pluralsight and it was barely sufficient to even pass the practice tests. The content doesnt cover A LOT of detail.

2. I took the Cloud practioner Exam after the SAA-CO2 and honestly, I didnt read much for this. Just the well architected framework and a few service things. But if you pass SAA-CO2 you will definitely be able to pass the cloud practitioner exam.

3. I took the security speciality exam and this was was the toughest. I used Zeal Voras Udemy course and it was absolutely great. He does spend longer than necessary on some topics. I highly recommend that you follow through with his demonstrations. This is what made the difference for me. Zeal is very good at what he does, so follow along.

4.  The last exam was the dev exam. I used stephane maareks course and honestly, only 1 question came that stephane hadnt provided info for in the course. this course and the sample exam is sufficient. Also, for things such as code commit and ECS, its important to follow along. You will pick up specific details through this.

Overall, its been a very interesting time for me. I just joined a company that is big on AWS so it was important that i do these. There was actually a competition that whoever gets the most certs for the months of June and July will get personalised Amazon merch. Im hoping i will win :-)

i0wkgp,Just passed my SAA-C02,"I just passed my SAA-C02, going to take a sigh of relief because at one point during the exam I actually did not know if I'm going to pass or not. 

Resources:
I studied for this for about 5-6 months. I started studying for the c01, wasn't confident enough to give the exam so decided to just wait and do the c02.
I started off with ACloudGuru - I feel like that's a great introductory course, someone who is new to AWS really lays the ground work to actually be able to understand the details of all the services later on. But not enough to just pass the exam with.
After that I took Adrian Cantrills course, that's where I really started to understand how stuff works in AWS. 
Eventually, bought Stephane Maareks course on Udemy as well, to basically do a revision of the entire course, ended up learning alot more from it.

Ofcourse the key is Jon Bonso's exams. The way he structures his questions are very similar to the actual exam. Because of these exam there were some questions I knew the answer to before even reading the entire question.
My first attempt on Bonso's exams I scored between 68 and 73. 
My last attempts for the exams I got 85+, that's where I decided to pull the trigger and give the exam.

During the exam:
Main thing is to stay positive and not lose hope, I got back to back questions where I was unsure of what the answers are. Stay focused, read the entire question, look for what they're asking like.. do they want high availability, do they want cost effective, do they want most secure solution etc etc.. 
I feel like 140 mins is ample time to do this exam, so take your time and read the questions and do not lose hope if you get a few back to back difficult questions.

It seems dumb to put a database in ephemeral storage, and EFS supports that level of IOPS, so it seemed like a reasonable choice.

I passed yesterday with a score of 914/1000! I studied for about two months using study resources from Stephane Maarek's Udemy course and Tutorials Dojo practice exams. With those two courses and study tips from some of you in this community, I felt confident enough to take the exam. So shoutout to those who post their experience and tips, you all are awesome!

The exam was very focused on serverless resources such as API Gateway, SNS, SQS, Lambda, SAM, and Step Functions. Another reoccurring topic I saw a lot of was Elastic Beanstalk. I had a few questions about deployment types with Elastic Beanstalk, so know those. Also, I had lots of questions about monitoring/logging. I would know X-Ray like the back of your hand. Surprisingly, I had no RCU/WCU calculations but had lots of other questions about DynmaoDB. Another thing to add is to know AWS security and encryption, especially KMS (S3 encryption...etc). Finally, know CI/CD as well.

Overall, I thought the exam was very challenging, but by using the study resources I mentioned above, you should not have a problem. Tutorials Dojo practice tests were spot on when relating to the actual exam, so definitely use them to practice. I recommend going through Maarek's course at least twice then use his videos/slides to understand certain topics you are having trouble understanding.

i0n0ic,Passed SAA- C02,"Hey Everyone, I just took my exam and passed it. I would like to thank you Jon Bonso for such great resources and exam preps. Thank you to everyone on this sub for the constant guidance too.I will advise anyone taking the exam to:

1. Manage your time.
2. Make sure you're reading the questions and understanding what they are asking for and POE is key to knowing what to choose.
3. Do the whole course, learn it don't memorize it. Learn why the correct answer is correct and the wrong answer is wrong.
4. Do some labs this really helps to see the services firsthand.
5. Lastly, do organized practice, write down and take note of things you might find difficult to remember, I would suggest making a key-words doc where you highlight the keywords in the questions to match with the service.

Will be aiming for my SysOps and Developer now!! Would appreciate some good courses for this too.GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!!",14,awscertifications,2020-10-13

i0ksqj,Passed the developer exam! (DVA-C01),"Resources used 

Linux academy 

* The course was good but it did not cover everything. I found that the exam tested more on actual experience developing rather than recalling the services and what they do. You will to supplement your learnings on the services covered on Linux Academy through AWS documentation. 

AWS Documentation

* Must read this! Do not skip on reading documentation and think that going through courses are enough! There are too many small details to recall such as troubleshooting and error messages. (There are many...)

Jon Bonso practice exams

* This is a must. My advice is that if you are not 100% confident in the answer just pick the most incorrect answer so you can get it wrong and go through the solution in detail. This really helped me supplement what I needed to know. 

Exam

* It was really stressful with a lot of second-guessing. I passed the SAA exam this year and boy, this one made me sweat. 
* Get your game up on Lambda, SAM, KMS, DynamoDB, ElasticBeanstalk, CodeDeploy/Build/Commit/Pipeline, SQS, SNS, ApiGateway, Kinesis, X-ray, Cognito (unexpectedly lots of Cognito). The usual culprits. 

Final points... 

* The survey at the end is a killer. After you submit the exam they have 9 survey questions... e.g. How was your experience etc... THIS got my heart pumping as I just wanted to see if I passed.",10,awscertifications,2020-10-13

jagnku,Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) For A Complete Beginner," Amazon EC2 is a service that allows you businesses to run their application in AWS cloud. You can easily set up a virtual machine and perform all your computation on it. In this post, we will teach you the basics of Amazon EC2.

# Introduction

* EC2 is one of the oldest and fundamental services of AWS.
* Though everything today is serverless, you still need to know EC2.
* EC2 allows you to do the following things :
* Rent virtual machines (EC2 itself)
* Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
* Distributing load across the machines (ELB)
* Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

# Amazon Machine Image – AMI

* AMIs are the templates from which virtual servers (EC2 instance) get created.
* In simple terms, AMIs are the collection of the operating system, architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) with the softwares that will be running on that operating system.
* For example :
* Amazon Linux AMI is the one that comes with a Linux operating system and many packages of the Linux that one might need.
* Windows AMI comes with Windows as its operating system and software one might need.
* By choosing AMI you basically decide the software part of your EC2 machine.
* You can use a single AMI and launch multiple instances from it.

# Instance Type

* As we have seen AMI defines the software part of your EC2, Instance type defines the hardware part of your EC2 machine.
* It is when you choose instance type you define the hardware configuration of your EC2 machines.
* Hardware configurations involve Memory, vCPUs, instance storage, network performance parameters.
* This instance types are categorized on the basis of what kind of requirement you have with your EC2 machines.

# Features 

* **Instance :** It provides you a virtual environment (instances) for your computing tasks.
* **AMIs :** It comes with set of many preconfigured templates for your instances known as Amazon Machine Images, that saves you the efforts of manually installing operating system and additional softwares and configuring them.
* **Instance Type :** You get a wide range of configurations of CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types. This allows you to select any power of computation as per your requirement.
* **Key Pairs :** EC2 comes with secure login also. It provides login through key pairs where AWS stores the public key and you store the private key.
* **Instance Store Volume :** By default it provides you storage volume to store your temporary data (data that gets deleted when you stop your instance) known as instance store volume.
* **Amazon EBS volume :** If you want to store your data even after your instance get stopped, EC2 provides you  persistent storage volume for your instance known as Amazon EBS volume.

jag47d,AWS IAM OVERVIEW,"#  

# IAM INTRODUCTION :

* **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** **is a service that allows you to manage users and their access to AWS.**
* **Your whole AWS security revolves around IAM.**
* **IAM is a global service. It’s not bound to any specific region.**
* **IAM allows you to control**  
**Identity: who can use your AWS resources (Authentication)**  
**Access: what resources they can use (Authorization)**
* **When you create AWS account, that very first account is called as Root account.**
* **When you first start with AWS you get a root access key. Root access key provides complete access to your AWS account and you should never use them.**
* **So you basically need to delete your root access key.**
* **You can set up MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for extra security.**

IAM FEATURES :

* **IAM provides you with centralized control of your AWS account.**
* **It provides shared access to your AWS account.**  
**You can grant other people access to your AWS account.**
* **It allows you to set Granular permissions.**  
**You can grant specific permission to specific users. For example, you might allow a user access to only some set of services only.**
* **Identity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn etc)**  
**Users can log in by using their company credentials without having an account with AWS.**
* **Multifactor Authentication**  
**This is two-factor authentication. User not only need to provide password or access key but also code from physical devices such as android or ios smartphone.**
* **Support PCI DSS compliance.**  
**IAM supports the processing, storage, and transmission of credit card data**
* **Provide application running on EC2 access to AWS resources.**  
**You can have your application running on EC2 secure access to AWS resource.**
* **IAM integrates with almost every AWS service.**  
**Since it’s a fundamental or core service that provides security, IAM integrates with almost all AWS services.**
* **Free to use**  
**IAM is a completely free service to use.**

IAM COMPONENTS :USERS

* **User is an AWS identity.**
* **User is basically a physical person.**
* **This physical person will get an account in IAM.**
* **New users have no permission when first created.**

GROUP

* **Group basically means a set of IAM users.**
* **Groups are basically defined by their function for example Developers, Admin etc.**
* **Instead of assigning the same permission to every other user individually, you can assign that permission to group and add all the users in that group.**
* **All the users in this group will inherit the permission of the group.**

ROLES

* **Role is an IAM identity that has specific permissions.**
* **Role is similar to User.**
* **But it is not associated with a specific person, a role is assumed by anyone who needs it.**
* **Role doesn’t have standard long term credentials such as password, it works on temporary security credentials for a session.**
* **Roles can be assigned to :**  
**An IAM user in the same account as role in.**  
**An IAM user in a different account than the role.**  
**An AWS service such as EC2.**

POLICIES

* **Policies are JSON documents.**
* **They define what User, Group and Roles can do or cannot do.**
* **Permissions are governed by policies.**
* **AWS provides you with many built-in policies that already have permissions according to use cases. This is the AWS managed policies.**
* **You can also create your own policy as well.**

IAM FEDERATION

* **IAM Federation is a feature which can be used by big enterprises.**
* **Generally, big enterprises have their own repository of users.**
* **Using IAM Federation such enterprises can integrate their own repository of users with IAM.**
* **This way users of such enterprises can log in into AWS using their company credentials.**
* **Identity Federation uses the SAML standard**

ja8mua,Another ambiguously worded question from Niel's CAA-S02 practice exam questions,"How could I better interpret this question.. to me it's a bit poorly worded or doesn't have enough context. 

From what I understand, you must have specified your instance store up front, at the time of provisioning your EC2 instance. The question doesn't even mention that there was any existing instance store, thus, this would require you to re-provision your entire EC2 instance in order to create the instance storage. The ""correct"" answer only says ""Move the temporary DB onto instance storage"", without indicating that they would need to re-provision an EC2 instance....

This is the only reason why I selected to put the temp DB on a new 50GB EBS io1 volume as this would not require reprovisioning of a new EC2 instance.

Now I truly understand what everyone means when they say that Niel's questions aren't worded well nor contain enough detail.

ja899d,To CCP or not to CCP,"I was reading a couple of threads on this sub recently and noticed that there seem to be differing opinions as to whether the CCP is worth doing at all.

I'm a technology writer that works with a few clients in the cloud world. I'm interested in taking an AWS cert both to demonstrate subject matter expertise and (potentially down the road) to begin segueing into technology itself. Perhaps TAM or something knows. Who knows. I want to keep my career options option. And cloud to me seems like a rock solid place to be over the medium term.

My rationale for thinking about thinking about skipping to Solutions Architect is that I've read that there's a lot of overlap between the two but that SA is obviously more in depth. I'm not in a rush to pass the certification, but I've also already invested a lot of time on Tutorials Dojo and Udemy to get to scoring 80% average in the practice tests (I need 90% before trying the real exam).

I'm also really enjoying the material. So if another few months of study could get me something more impressive ... part of me thinks that it makes sense to rationalize my efforts and focus on the better credential. But on the flip side, right now my use-case is going to be non-technical — which makes CCP sound like a better fit.

**My question is: do most people follow the certification ladder sequentially? And is SA a bigger leap beyond CCP than I'm envisioning?**

Also thanks to whoever recommended Stephane Maarek's Udemy course to me! I trained with one of the big online cloud training providers but felt like it left an awful lot of knowledge gaps.

\*\*\*

**How long did you prepare for?**

I prepared for about 1.5 months and have some cloud experience with both AWS and Azure.

**Which resources did you use?**

I started off with A Cloud Guru's SAA course on Udemy but switched to [Stephane Maarek's SAA course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/)midway. I found Maarek's course to cover more depth and provide a better understanding of the various services.

Once done with the course, I took a total of 12 practice exams by [Neal Davis](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-tests-k/) and [Tutorials Dojo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/)(TD/Jon Bonso) and scored between 75-90 on all of them. I felt Neal's exams were a bit tougher than TD but TD's exam questions were a bit more realistic and situation-based.

I'd say the actual exam was halfway between TD and Neal and so, would recommend taking both.

**How was your exam day experience?**

I had read the comments here so I cleaned my desk, disconnected all the external monitors and put a DND sign outside my door. I started the process at 4:30pm, 30 minutes before my exam. They'll make you upload a bunch of photos including a selfie, an ID and your surroundings. Once you submit these photos, you have to wait for the proctor to arrive and begin your exam.

I started off slow and flagged a lot of questions for reviews. I returned to the flagged questions when I had an hour remaining. Slogged through them, contemplating over the answers and finished everything with 10 minutes remaining. For some reasons, I had a LOT of questions on Storage Gateway!

Once I submitted my exam, I had to finish a short survey and after that came the long awaited screen displaying **PASS** in bold letters!

\*\*\*

I created my own notes based on Maarek's course, TD cheat sheets, AWS FAQs and Neal Davis exams: [https://www.notion.so/rxhl/AWS-SAA-698442acf94a484caa56477344dafc9d](https://www.notion.so/rxhl/AWS-SAA-698442acf94a484caa56477344dafc9d)",52,awscertifications,2020-10-13

I took and enjoyed the Linux Academy course. But I'm thinking that, as I'm effectively coming from a zero in terms of my technical background, that I need a longer and more in depth course before even getting to this stage.

j8rz4p,Has anyone had a good experience with PSI online? definitely not me,"I tried taking my CSAA exam today with PSI online proctoring.  At first, the secure browser hung on ""waiting for proctor to verify identity and prepare exam"" for 40 min.  Once I finally got hold of support (the second time - their live chat does not work well on cell phones) and rebooted, reinstalled, and restarted, the proctor immediately appeared and I completed the room scan.  However, before I could even get to the exam, it claimed my face was not centered (even though it clearly was) and terminated after 5 minutes (and the error screen blocked chatting with the proctor).  To make it more frustrating, the whole time the secure browser was hung, it was registering my face as centered (green circle) unless I significantly moved.  After that, I called PSI (once I finally found their phone support number) and was told that I had a ""major violation"" but they couldn't tell me what (face obviously) and I would have to contact AWS support.  Given that PSI could verify the video feed, that I had not actually started the exam, and they seem to be the primary AWS certification partner, I'm baffled why PSI could not directly reschedule my exam (in-person or credit it so I could schedule with Pearson VUE online).  I will certainly never schedule another PSI online exam.

j8m7ma,Passed Solution Architect Professional test yesterday!,"Finally passed my SAP test on the second try yesterday. Wanted to share my experience if it's useful for anyone else. 

Stephane Maarek's SAP course ( https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional/ ) is an absolute must. I also made it through a good chunk of Adrian Cantrill's Linux Academy course before ACG bought them. His new Pro course isn't finished yet, but when it is, absolutely use it. 

Speaking of A Cloud Guru, I was previously a big fan of them, as I used their courses to pass my Solution Architect Associate and my Security Specialty exams. Sadly, though, their current SAP course is AWFUL. It feels like a super low effort course that hits a few bullet points per topic and then sends you off to read white papers for hours. 

I didn't take any practice exams, as I had taken this test before and knew somewhat of what to expect. The biggest thing I noticed is that it was easier to eliminate some of the wrong answers to the questions by reading them carefully. Many of the incorrect answers were obvious because they listed services as doing things they cannot do (for example, one answer said ""Use AWS Inspector to filter traffic"", which it obviously doesn't do). It took me about 2 hours and 15 minutes to complete the 75 questions, and that was including time to review any I was unsure of. 

I had questions from a broad range of topics, but it seemed like many of them ended up being a scenario, and then the question would be ""How do you architect this for better operational overhead?"" Or ""How would you optimize this solution for cost while maintaining resiliency"". It seems like they want you to be able to architect various solutions based on the 5 pillars, so prepare for knowing how to do that.

It also didn't hurt that I've been actively working in AWS almost daily for about 5 years now. Having a lot of hands on experience with various AWS resources is great.

I set up my business a couple of years back and doing really well now. I'm looking to hire some people in the near future. However, before everything starts going gangbusters I would like to try and get some certifications with AWS under my belt. The last qualification I got was my degree 5 years ago from University back in the UK for Business Information Technology.

I have since moved to NZ and have been using AWS for about 3 years. Developing primarily with ECS, S3, Lambda, SQS, EC2, SES. Over the next few years I'll be hoping to hand off much of the development to new members of the team. 
I would like to focus more on the business/requirement gathering and making deals than coding 24/7. Node.js and MongoDB have served me very well in allowing me to start my business, but there are much better developers out there than me haha!

My business is focused around B2B integration into ERP systems, web scraping and e-commerce.

The real questions I have on my mind...
- Is it worth doing the AWS cloud practitioner?
- Should I go for solutions architect or developer?

I couldn't have done this without either of you &lt;3

Second of all, man that was a tough exam. I got so many Cloud Formation questions that I wasn't expecting at all. There were actually very few questions from Networking (VPCs), EC2, Storage or Databases. Mostly it was CFromation, AWS Organizations, IAM, ELB/ASG and  Monitoring/Troubleshooting.

Preparation I did was using Stephane's course and Jon's tests. Along with that I made liberal use of the cheat sheets over at the tutorial dojo website. Specially the ""Difference between services"" pages. It took me slightly more than a month to prepare and it also helped that I've been in Operations role before so it was easier to pick up concepts and translate them to AWS scenarios.

Score I got is 764 which to me is really lower than what I had hoped coming out of the exam and way lower than what I had hoped going into it. I'd like to blame myself for not paying attention to Cloud Formation much but hey, a win is a win. From here on, I'd like to work towards Database Speciality exam since that is what I've been doing for the past 4 years.

j7heyq,Passed SAA-C02! Here's what helped me.,"Passed the SAA-C02 after the 2nd attempt. Studied using only Cloud Guru the first time, and failed (695). Then discovered this subreddit and learned about Stephane Maarek and tutorial dojos, and was able to pass it the 2nd try with a 780.

Heres the study method that helped me the best:

\- Of course, watch the full course and take notes. What I did was I waited until I finished the course, then went back to read and highlight the important things in my notes.

\- After that, I wouldn't even take the practice exams in the course yet, I would start with the Tutorial Dojo tests. The ones on [their website](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/), not the Udemy ones. These practice exams are a BIG HELP, as they are just as tricky as the real exam.

\- So Tutorial Dojo has their tests split into different categories; Timed Mode, Review Mode, Section Based, Topic Based, and Final Test (which is honestly the same thing as the Timed exams). Dont stress if you fail hard the first couple of times. Understanding the wording and finesse of the test itself is a whole other thing to learn. Doing them this way helped me the best:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Start with Topic Based tests. Take each one, if you fail one, go back to the Udemy course you took and re watch the topic of the test you just took. After that, go back and retry the exam one more time. Repeat for all topics.
2. Next, do the Section Based tests. Like the Topic Based ones, if you fail one, go back and look at the questions you got wrong, try finding the sections where they're talked about in the Udemy class, and take one more time. Avoid taking any of these tests more than 2 times, as you could risk memorizing the questions.
3. Now we move onto the Review Mode exams. These are a bit longer, 30 questions each. Just take each exam, if you fail one, just review what questions you got wrong and read the explanations, then move on to the next one.  Hopefully by the end of this section, you'll be adjusted to the wording of the questions/answers. 
4. Finally, we move onto the Timed Mode/Final Test. I put these in the same category because they're essentially the same thing. Take these as if you were taking the real thing, and once you start hitting 80+, I would say you're ready for the real thing.

\- Now the actual test itself was very tricky/hard lol. There were only about 5 easy questions, the rest were similar to the harder questions in the tutorial dojo practice exams, so my brain was fried after I finished the exam. But if you're freaked out after reading that, don't worry, because according to their [scoring system](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/demystifying-your-aws-certification-exam-score/), the harder your questions are, the less you need to get right in order to pass. Hence, the easier your questions are, the more you need right. 

\- A lot of S3 (I surprisingly had about 4 questions on intelligent tiering). A lot of ASG and data base questions, especially on RDS. I would say that made up about 70% of the exam. Only about 7-10 questions were on DynamoDB. A couple of questions on lambda and KMS/secruity, but alot of them were combined with the data base questions. Lastly, did get like 5 questions on ECS/containers. Only a couple of ELB questions.  No questions really on IAM.

Thats all I can really think of for now, but if you have any questions at all, feel free to PM me! Thanks again to Stephane Maarek, the Tutorial Dojo team, and of course this subreddit! :)))",45,awscertifications,2020-10-13

I used the Jon Bonso practice exams on udemy I got on sale last year.  The explanations on the questions are where I learned the most details and gotchas related to thinking about the questions properly.   


As far as the test, just make sure to look for what they are specifically asking. Often the question would invalidate half the scenario by asking you for the cheapest way, or Most secure, or Most something, and then multiple answers would look correct, but only one is the MOST whatever they are asking. Also if the question asked for a solution to meet multiple requirements (scalable, fault-tolerant, etc) make sure your answer actually meets all 2 or 3 requirements listed. A lot of answers look good but are only partial solutions.   


Anyways, that's my two cents. Hope it helps somebody. Good luck to everyone!",0,awscertifications,2020-10-13

j6oowi,Would passing CCP be any use in the job market?,"I'm currently undertaking training to pass the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

I make a living as a freelance writer with a strong focus on technology. I've been writing about subjects like cloud and cyber for years so thought that passing CCP would be a good way to show that I (mostly!) know what I'm talking about - as the freelance writing market, especially among tech writers, is full of bluffers.

However, I'm wondering if CCP is so basic that tech clients might even look down on it?

Also: what else could one ""do"" at this level of the certification ladder? Any openings in doors that might have been closed?",2,awscertifications,2020-10-13

I was getting 80%+ on the Linux Academy tests but now am down to 50%. So I need to keep working through these until I'm at something like 90% before booking the test.

I know that this is the entry level to the AWS certification program, but I'm a little surprised by how detailed it is. I've been using AWS for a number of years (albeit personally - so many of the support and billing stuff was unfamiliar). 

Basically - is it just me or is it not easy?

My career path has established me as The Storage Guy - NetApp, IBM, EMC, Dell - as well as The Backup Guy. I dabble in VMWare too. I giveth the storage and I taketh it away; I replace hard drives/SSDs when I can; I give plausible answers when someone says ""my storage is slow."" I make sure your DR site is full of the data you want to keep, and I make sure you don't keep too much old crap that's expensive to store.

I feel like I'm pretty good at my job and I'd like to continue working in those lanes, but I don't mind learning new things too.

Is there an AWS equivalent to being The Storage And Backup Guy Who Dabbles In Virtualization? If so which certification might be the best to start with?

j64f59,Proctoring - can I have turned off monitors?,"Hi folks,

Looking at doing the AWSCP exam soon through remote proctoring.

Day to day, I work at a desktop which has three monitors on a mount.

I live in a fairly small apartment and this room (my home office) is probably the best to do the test in — it's relatively small, cubic, and has no other screens besides those on the mount.

My question is whether the proctor will likely have a problem with me bringing in my laptop and using it at the desk while my desktop is powered off (but the screens are turned off but on the mount).

Otherwise I'm going to have to do the test in my bedroom, which would feel weird, or deconstruct my mount just for an hour - which seems stupid.

Sorry if this is overthinking things. I've heard the proctors are really strict!",2,awscertifications,2020-10-13
j61za6,S3 Encryption sample question,"There's a question posted here, that I want to get clarification on: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/ik2b57/aws\_certified\_developer\_dvap01\_practice\_exam\_s3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/ik2b57/aws_certified_developer_dvap01_practice_exam_s3/)

&gt;A company wants to store sensitive user data in Amazon S3 and encrypt this data at rest.  The company must manage the encryption keys themselves and use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption.  
&gt;  
&gt;How can a developer meet these requirements ?  
&gt;  
&gt;A. Enable default encryption for the S3 bucket using a customer-provided keys option.  
B. Provide a private encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.  
C. Provide a public encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.  
D. Provide a symmetric encryption key when uploading an object to the S3 bucket.

Right off the bat I agree with the original poster that B/C are not options as S3 encryption supports symmetric encryption only.

That original post that I linked above only has a single response, and that person says that D) is talking about client-side encryption, so therefore the answer is A).  But is D) really talking about client-side encryption?  Wouldn't client-side encryption be using some external tools to encrypt the data *before* sending it to S3?  Option D here is saying that you *provide* the key to S3, and that S3 does the encryption (so this seems to satisfy the question wording of, ""use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption"").

With A), it seems like a trick question, because the stipulation in the question is that the company must ""manage the encryption keys.""  And when you enable Default Encryption for a bucket, your two choices are:

* AES-256 (SSE-S3) --- this is not a choice that will satisfy this answer
* AWS-KMS (SSE-KMS) --- but could this?

By default, when you create a KMS CMK, the key material is generated by AWS, which does not satisfy the requirement of the company managing the key.  However I was just searching and found that you can actually import your own key material into a CMK: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html) which in this case seems like it *would* allow you manage the encryption key content yourself, but just in the form of KMS CMK.

I feel like the wording on A) with ""customer-provided keys"" implies that it's saying to use a choice other than AES-256 and AWK-KMS (which isn't an option), so I feel like the answer is actually D)...",2,awscertifications,2020-10-13

j5rs4c,Amazon Web Services launches new certification program," Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched a Global Certification Program, which will allow solutions architects, systems operations administrators, and developers to get proof of their cloud know-how.

The new program has been designed to certify the technical skills and knowledge associated with ""building secure and reliable cloud-based applications using AWS technology,"" Amazon [said](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2013/04/30/announcing-amazon-web-services-global-certification-program/).

A solutions architect is a person who knows the ins and outs of designing distributed applications and systems on the AWS platform, while a sysops administrator is responsible for the operational health of an application running on Amazon's cloud. The latter should have in-depth knowledge of the application or service being operated, including how the application is constructed, deployed, and automated, as well as the controls and monitoring points available, according to Amazon. Developers in turn design and build AWS-based applications.

There are three different levels to choose from: associate, professional and master. To earn a certification for one of the three levels, candidates must pass an exam, which will be administered through Kryterion testing centers in more than 100 countries and 750 testing locations worldwide. Training and other resources from Amazon will offer help when preparing.

The program will be rolled out in multiple steps. The first certification to be offered is the AWS Certified Solutions Architect at an Associate Level, Amazon said. To pass that level, candidates are expected to have an understanding of elasticity and scalability concepts as well how network technologies relate to Amazon's cloud. Another important part is understanding how to interact with AWS services, including APIs (application programming interfaces) and SDKs (software development kits).

Certifications for the other two roles will become available later this year, Amazon said. On its certification website there is [more information to be found.](http://aws.amazon.com/certification/)
