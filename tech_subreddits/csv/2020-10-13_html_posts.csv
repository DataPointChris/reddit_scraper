jaixh0,Numbers with Mouse,"I'm trying to get the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer, and I've done that. However, I have them below my image, which I have to scroll down to see. My question is, is there anyway to get the numbers to show up next to my cursor? Like whenever the mouse moves, the mouse coordinates change, and they are displayed to the right or left of the cursor as its moving.

Here is what I've tried

`&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`

`&lt;html&gt;`

`&lt;head&gt;`

`&lt;style&gt;`

`#container {`

  `width: 1272px;`

  `height: 1224px;`

  `border: 1px solid #777;`

`}`

`&lt;/style&gt;`

`&lt;/head&gt;`

`&lt;body&gt;`

`&lt;div id=""container"" onmousemove=""event_function(event)""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

`&lt;span id=""show_position""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;`

`&lt;script&gt;`

`function event_function(event) {`

  `var x = event.clientX;`

  `var y = event.clientY;`

  `var coo = ""X and Y position: "" + x + "","" + y;`

  `document.getElementById(""show_position"").innerHTML = coo;`

`}`

`&lt;/script&gt;`

`&lt;/body&gt;`

`&lt;/html&gt;`

j9yysv,Best option for form on a personal site,"Hello

I want to add a ‚ÄúContact Me‚Äù form on my personal website (which just features my resume) in order to solicit feedback from people (including potential employers) viewing that information.  I want to feature this form not only to avoid spam responses, but also learn how to do it.  

I‚Äôve added a form using HTML and customized it with CSS.  I have a PHP form action command in the HTML but it just goes to a blank page.  

- is PHP the best way to get my form working properly?

- if so, do I, in theory, have to just add some PHP scripting that does something like relay the user input data to my host and relay that to an email to me?",1,html,2020-10-13

j9spb1,[help] Trying to create a contact list with DOM and js,"Hey so what I want my code to do is :

1. If I enter 1 =&gt; I see all my contacts
2. If I enter 2 =&gt; I can add a name in the same textbox, then input a firstname, and register it in my list of contacts
3. If I enter 3 =&gt; I quit

So I somehow figured step 1 and 3. 

For the step 2, I can't figure how I can, after entering 2 in the textbox, make the program understand that it now needs to check the name I enter next.

I tried different things like calling a new function, changing the id,...

I suppose I need to use an `addEventListener` of my input text or maybe a `Promise` function but I don't really know how to use it...

In this project I made a website about my favourite story. I needed to use 5 new tags in my code so I used:

* &lt;meta&gt; to add a description and some keywords to my site that search engines can read and use to direct potentially interested web users to my page
* &lt;iframe&gt; to embed a youtube video in my code
* &lt;form&gt; to create a set of data that could be sent to another program - as I am only just starting out with HTML, I don't know how to do this, so my data doesn't actually go anywhere!
* &lt;input&gt; to specify input fields, where the user can put information into my page
* &lt;select&gt; to create a dropdown list

I've been working on this responsive navigation for quite some time. I've been having issues figuring out the icon dropdown menu when it's in the phone display navigation. I've been researching how to fix the issue, and unlucky to find any solutions. 

I have it set up where one display is none and the is displayed to show. I need assistants to make this work.

from the line (12 - 95) is my CSS script for the navigation including @.media

from the line (204 - 208) is my javascript for the navigation

j7j4oc,Which platform?,"Hi all,

I'm NOT  a web developer but a few years ago I learned HTML and CSS and built half a dozen web sites, mostly for friends. 
I used the WordPress platform because my friends asked for the option to change the content by themselves and the Atahualpa theme as it was fully customisable. And that was all.

Very recently I tried to build another one, and as you may guess I tried to use WordPress again. However, so far is a disaster! WordPress had introduced blocks, and I can't tame it: As I said, I used HTML &amp; a lot of CSS for my sites, but new WordPress do its own thing with my code. Tried to play with their block thing, but I wisiwig NOT.

In short, what I'm looking for is a platform that will allow me to code a lot, (but not everything, I don't want to use plain txt files to do everything from scratch) and it will not take ages to learn. Which one do you use?",2,html,2020-10-13

I am following along with [this tutorial on parsing websites with requests-html.](https://youtu.be/5u391bX9FVE?t=1049)

**Goal:** My goal is to learn more by applying his code on a more difficult website (stackoverflow, for example.) I successfully isolated the 'div' tag/class using the code below. I now intend to sort everything on stackoverflow's recent questions page that is labeled div to find the 'question-summary' and somehow isolate the question ID.

* I want to isolate the question ID, save the associated html page for that unique question, and read each html page for each question that are in the first 3 pages (150 questions) of the most recent questions posted.

**Problem:** At the 17:29 in the video, he points out that the tag/class he using a selector on was only used once and he would ""need to go back to the drawing board"" if it was used more than once.

I am trying to search for something relating to either 'id' or question-summary-#' . I am not sure what I am searching for but I know that there will be more than one. **What is the next step**?

&amp;#x200B;

Also just as a side note. I would love it if the user could press enter/return on the keyboard for this to work instead of click pay but if that can't be done all good !

Sometimes idk what to do so I search for the code online to compare it to mine to find mistake or simply learn by looking at which code tag I need to use.

Any leads would help a ton, I have acces to the solution sheet from the book but its already coded and its only a link to an html page ( so no help at all in learning the codes).

So my goal is to write about what codes you need to use for specific symbols in HTML.

So for example ""for &lt; and &gt; you use &amp;lt and &amp;gt"". But how can I write this into html without the browser showing the two codes as the symbol.

j4npr7,Declaring Doctype,"I'm trying to understand something regarding &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; with regards to Wordpress.

I  have created many HTML pages locally and then added them to my  Wordpress site using the text editor feature. A problem I have noticed  is I have not declared a DOCTYPE or used &lt;html&gt; or &lt;head&gt;  tags. My code effectively starts from &lt;H1&gt; for every page.

When  I view a web page of mine in a browser and click view page source  &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; is shown despite me not adding it myself.

My  question is: does Wordpress automatically include it if I don't? Should  I be looking to add the doctype manually to each and every page I've  done so far, or is it safe to leave as it is?",6,html,2020-10-13

j1vqor,Outlook signature : html coding so that local attachments convert to CID,"Hi all,

For our company, I've created a default Outlook signature via MS Word.Via a script, I have personalized the signature for everyone with our Active Directory data. This is working well.

However the html file created by MS Word is huge, so I recreated the signature from scratch in html. It is looking indentical to the MS Word signature now, but there is one thing that I can't get to work:

I am referencing to locally stored images in the signature\_files -directory. Of course when I send the mail, these local images are not available at the receivers side.The original MS Word signature also references to these local images, but apparently during sending, it attaches the images to the mail, and references to them in the signature via CID: ...

I have tried to analyse the code (I guess it has to to with the commented VML-code ), but I am not succeeding in implementing this myself in my html-signature.

Doe anybody know something about this? How can I make a html-signature that uses cid-images without a script?

PS. I'd like to avoid hosted images, as this gives other issues.

Thanks,

Thomas.",2,html,2020-10-13

I want to create a JS function that would be called onLoad() of the iFrame, and check whether the iFrame is on the website I want it to be on. This could be either through checking the current URL of the iFrame, or scraping the HTML of the the iFrame with the #document page. And once I know that the iFrame is on the correct site, I would simulate a button click to return a POST request to my Flask app. Previously, I tried to make it so that onLoad() would always simulate a button click, but that would lead to the page reloading itself everytime a button click was done, hence creating a reload loop. So I need the processing to be done before sending any sort of POST request through a button. How do I go about making this happen?",0,html,2020-10-13

izpws6,"In a dl, are both the dt and DD required in order for the dl to be valid?","I think I know the answer to this, but here's some context. I'm creating a custom post in WordPress with some custom fields. I'm giving the user the ability to create some links with required fields for the URL and the link name, then an optional field for a description. 

So basically I'm wanting to front end it in a `dl`, with the link going in the `dt` and the description going into a `dd`. But what if they don't enter a description? Since it's optional (some links will be obvious, some users will be lazy), I know not every person is gonna fill out the description field, which will mean there's no reason to have a `dd` element.

I know nobody's gonna hit me with a ruler if I'm not 100% semantic at all times, but that's still the goal you know?

Thoughts? Should I just do a `ul` instead? I'll probably be hiding the `dd` by default and turning into a sort of tooltip kinda thing anyway, so maybe the trusty old `ul` is the way to go.",2,html,2020-10-13

Example:

I have a table with the following columns: A, B, c, d, e.

When selecting an A/B combo, the table should only show the rows that have the A/B combo values.

iy8npn,DevFolio," This is a simple responsive portfolio website template. You can use it and make it yours by changing things and colours to your style and liking! I made it with a lot of hard work, love and of course with code :) I'm not a professional coder, but I tried my best to make it look cool and yet still keep it simple.

&gt;Mistakes are proof that we are trying!

I learned so much while making this template, if you use it, please let me know. I would love to see how amazing people can make it! I hope you'll like it!

## I have used:

* **HTML5** for markup
* Pure **CSS3** for styling
* Bit of **Jquery** to make header animation effects work
* Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices
* **Font Awesome** for Icons
* **Unsplash** for Images

You can add more things to make it even cooler! The comments in the code will help you navigate through it. Have a nice day! :D

ixnn8d,Help with trying to format a table in Dreamweaver,"I have downloaded a template I found online in Dreamweaver and I am trying to fix what I think is the padding on this table.

Whenever I add text to each box, the box expands to allow for padding around it and then throwing the entire format of this calendar off. I have messed with everything, I am trying to research this, but I am not a web person. I have a pretty decent grasp, but I cannot figure this out.

ix81yy,HTML5 Date Format Rant,"A good many customers want dates formatted in mm/dd/yyyy format, not the default of HTML5's date type (in INPUT tag), which is YYYY-MM-DD. There is no standard way to change the format in HTML5, meaning one usually ends up using JavaScript plug-ins and other round-about tricks instead of the date type.

MM/DD/YYYY is such a common need that I don't understand why it was left out of the standard. What went wrong with the standards process to account for this mass failure in real-world-land? The date type as it is now is **nearly useless in practice**. We can't fix the standards process without understanding why it went wrong.

One can argue that different countries do dates differently, but two optional attributes similar to the following could cover most cases. Example: &lt;input type=""date"" sequence=""mdy"" separator=""/""&gt;

It's not perfect, but covers the vast majority of variations desired. ""Sequence"" tells which element goes in which order, and ""separator"" tells which separation character is expected. It wouldn't ""break"" existing HTML5 markup.

Note that the built-in regular expression approach prevents using the date type such that the browser's built-in calendar widget (most brands) can't be used with it. Thus, one pretty much has to use JavaScript plug-ins regardless to get ""normal"" date UI functionality.

*Addendum:* the issue of whether it's a display problem or back-end data problem came up. I'm mostly considering the user interface (display) side. And note that some browser brands seem to have changed their display format recently. My point is the input format should be explicitly controllable at the *field level* (and maybe CSS) and not left to browser vendor whim or global defaults, if the developer so chooses. That way the software can work consistently and end users don't have to fiddle with browser or OS configurations.",0,html,2020-10-13
ix4knf,File sharing help,"So I'm fairly new to web development. This is only the second website I've ever made, but I have some prior programming knowledge which helps. What I am trying to do is take a file, upload it to my website, and after it's uploaded, give the user a link to either view or download it. The user can then share that link with other people.

What I have right now is an html file that takes the file as input, and passes it to a php script. The php script moves it to a folder, and then outputs a link to that file. So if I upload a file named picture.jpg, and I put it in the ""files"" folder, the link the user gets will look like this:

http://website.com/files/picture.jpg

The only problem is that this isn't very efficient. A friend of mine uploaded a 100MB video, and when he goes to view it, it takes ages to load and then view. I'm not sure if my wifi speed affects the loading time, but my upload speed is 10 mbps and his download speed is ~140 mbps. Is there a more efficient way to share these files for viewing? I know that with things like like youtube I'm never waiting for 20 minutes to watch a 30s video. Is it processing power? Network speed? An inefficient server?

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this or not.",7,html,2020-10-13

Is there a decent FREE online creator that anyone knows of? I had stumbled upon one years ago but can't seem to find it nor anything that will give you the code for free. Obviously, free usually means data harvesting, lol, but I might bite that bullet if I need to.

If this seems like a tall order are there other options, like something via Adobe, that would give me the ability to create it? FYI, I'm using Apple Mail for my client. Thanks in advance!",5,html,2020-10-13

ivuvg4,"A snake game , by Me","https://github.com/fast-and-curious-1910/snake-game.git
# About 
This a simple HTML , Javascript game made by me. This is he iconic snake game 
### The About The Game
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience. There are over 300 Snake-like games for iOS alone

## How To Play 
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself. a sole player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so controlling is progressively more difficult. 
USE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE 


## Where to play 

Either just download index.html and run it /  go to the [website](https://fast-and-curious-1910.github.io/snake-game/) 

## Problems
I have noticed some times it won't work , then 
replace 
&lt;br&gt;
```
&lt;script&gt;
..................
&lt;/script&gt;
```
with 

```
&lt;script src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fast-and-curious-1910/snake-game/master/script.js""&gt;
```
or if that dosent work , go to 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fast-and-curious-1910/snake-game/master/script.js and copy it , then 
remove and everythong between them 
```
&lt;script&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
```
and write 
```
&lt;script&gt;
// CODE YOU COPIED
&lt;/script&gt;
```
and if that dosent work , it is impossible

Been learning a lot and went through HTML (semantics), CSS, and also learned a bit about Bootstrap which I really love as it makes some things a lot easier.

Anyways, we're nearing our final project for the first class, which is due in about 2 weeks. We need to use things we've learned, as well as using semantics for the flow of the page.

I'm having a hard time coming up with an idea for a Finals Project and was hoping I could get some ideas and advice?

I'm looking for a way to share a link (maybe something similar to bitly?) to a group so that when each person opens said-link, they get to a website, randomly assigned from a list I previously generated. 

Basically, let's say I have a list with the following websites:
1. http://www.bbc.com/news/
2. http://www.news.cnet.com/
3. http://www.nytimes.com/

I want to be able to share ONE single link so that when opening it, some people get the BBC page, some the CNet page, and some the NYTimes. 

The only things I managed to find is links that open ALL of the links, either in multiple tabs or in some kind of slideshow, but those don't really help me. I just hope I'm not the only one that thought of this...

Imagine a webpage was coded entirely with &lt;divs&gt; what would users be missing out on.

Some ideas which I‚Äôve thought of already:

* Using heading elements allows reader modes (such as Safari reader mode) choose appropriate heading styles. Screen reader users can also navigate by heading.

* Using input modes on forms allows a device to choose an appropriate keyboard to show.

* Associating a form input with a label means you can click the label to focus on the form input

irwct0,Trying to make a vote/click counter," 

Hello, I'm attempting to create a click counter or vote button on a simple webpage, so that the counter rises by 1 (for everyone) every time someone clicks it. Most click counters use window.localStorage.getItem  
 to count up the clicks, but of course this stores the number on the client side and thus is unique to each user. I need to store the data server side.

ir5wqf,Current student looking for advice.,"Hey everyone, this is my first time posting in this sub.

A little bit of background. So I'm 35 years old and have been using computers since I was about 13 years old. I was taught by a good friends dad who is a Network Engineer and was building boxes, using DOS to run programs before Windows came along, and did a little HTML back in the day, but haven't really kept up, but I've always had a passion for computers and coding. All of this while struggling with ADHD and still do to this day. Although now I'm getting treatment for it.

Fast forward to today and I'm now currently in school for Web Development. It's a 10 month fast paced program and I'm looking for advice on things I should learn and how best to study in order to succeed. As I said, I'm 35 years old now, now married, and I HAVE to succeed. I'd be the first out of my family to graduate from any type of college and working hard towards building a better future for my wife and myself. 2 years married now btw. I'm not getting any younger and if I don't do this now at 35, I believe I never will.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I'm just looking on how best to prepare myself. We're currently working on Forms and I'm struggling a bit as how to link the Submit button to an external url to store in a database. Before this I was doing very well in the class (due to my past experience/knowledge) and now I believe I'm putting too much pressure on myself. I was up until about 4 am last night just working on an assignment and trying to get things done. Is this normal? And I pressuring myself too much and putting too much expectations on myself?

&amp;#x200B;

What could I do to study harder and learn more? At this point, I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I've been taking so many notes and spending so much time trying to learn new code, position elements, and style with CSS, that I think I'm having mental exhaustion. 

If you've read this far, I applaud you, and any advice you may have for me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",8,html,2020-10-13

Hi all. So I‚Äôve managed to build a very basic, static website (I am a total beginner). I am still not done styling it, but all the html code is there.

I am linking three pages to each other. It worked originally but when I had to move the htm files the links stopped working. I tried renaming the files in the new location and linking those, but it still didn‚Äôt work.

 My code:
(nav)

(ul)

(li)
(a href=‚Äúlink‚Äù) Achievements (/a)

(li)
(a href=‚Äúlink‚Äù) Interests (/a)

(li)
(a href=‚Äúlink‚Äù) Goals (/a)

(/li)

(/ul)

I also inserted two buttons on one of my pages and those links also aren‚Äôt working.

(Button type=‚Äúbutton‚Äù onclick=‚Äúlink‚Äù) Linkedin (/button)

I've tried css grid, but some of my tables are too long and get cut off.

My   tables are different heights one each page, so it needs to account for   that too. The width can change, but it won't change by much, and we   could set a fixed width, if really needed.

The goal is for a print out that is simple for people to use. They open the html file, click print, and it just works :).

I   decided to use HTML, because it's easy(-ish) the tables can change in   size, and web browsers seem to be able to scale things easily.",1,html,2020-10-13

    }

Above is a code that my co-student wrote for his assignment. We've been working together. I've been trying to do my version of it. His work is already on a server. The strange thing is that when I load his work into my IDE it doesn't render, but when I log into his page that is on the server it renders perfectly fine. Another odd things is when I copy his code into my project it doesn't render when I use the live server function. Why it is odd is that that we are both using the exact same starter code. The only thing we are adding to the  assignment is that above code.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried re-downloading the zip file that we have for the class and starting from scratch but that doesn't do anything to make the thing render.

Here is my friend's version of the assignment:

[http://ctec.clark.edu/\~s.burgoon/assignments/assignment9/assignment9.html](http://ctec.clark.edu/~s.burgoon/assignments/assignment9/assignment9.html)

I want to have a map of North America, with the territories clickable. Of course, this is a challenge since territory borders are irregular, not square.

Another thing I would like to be able to do is change the color or image of the territory. So for example, the territory will be gray and boring when unexplored, and brown and vibrant when explored. I may use images, or just change its color, I haven't decided yet.

Anyway, what direction should I go in?

- SVG's with position absolute?
- PNG's with position absolute and transparent areas?
- sprites?
- JS Canvas?
- other ideas?

As someone the time to do it? Really easy. It should be phone friendly, because I want to do a QR Code to scan.

Why do I want that? I recently moved from a house to a flat, and I wanted to give my neighbors this page so when my music is too loud, they can just click the button and my lights starts to blink, so I know music is too loud :D Pretty dumb, but I love the idea.

I'm trying to embed a youtube video that is - full width, autoplays, is on mute, with hidden controls, and is not clickable. I'd also like to scale the video a bit past its container to hide the title?

id6p41,Sections Overlapping,"EDIT: My 5 am brain is the worst. So I fixed it by changing the position to relative and updating the live preview. The live preview was lagging behind in the code, thus no changes were showing.  Thank you to anyone who commented, much appreciated!

So for the life of me, I cannot figure out what's going on! Partially because it's almost 5 am and I've also looked through my code for a mistake but I can't seem to find anything. So, of course, I cam to Reddit for help. So, I am coding a website for a class and as I'm nearing the end of the basics, the sections of the bottom of the webpage start to overlap and won't go back to normal. I have attached my code so you can get a sense of my frustration. Please feel free to call out my stupidity.

icta15,Identifying the source of data on a webpage,"Hi folks,

I've been working out a bug in a MATLAB-based [project](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/ib8zaz/webread_is_not_collecting_all_html_code_from/) of mine for a while. Since then I think I've identified that the problem is JavaScript is sourcing the data on [this](https://www.tennis24.com/rankings/wta-race/) page from somewhere else, and therefore using MATLAB's webread function doesn't copy any of it down for me.

If I could identify the URL of the actual source for the data on the page, I could try using the webread function on that link and see if it gives me the data I want. But it's buried in the html code of the website somewhere and I don't know how to find it. Can anyone please advise me on the best course of action here?",1,html,2020-10-13

ibzrjt,Pulling my hair out over a seemingly simple issue.,"Hi all, I've been having this weird issue preventing me from starting with one of my projects. I hope you're able to be of help.

I have been trying to make a stylesheet link work, but no matter what the attributes applied to the stylesheet do not seem to be working. The preview code of the things working together will be placed below. (Also the PHP include file, tho I couldnt find a php selection for jsfiddle) 

Maybe the only thing I can add is that I might have edited an .htaccess wrongly in the rootfolder to force-redirect to the https://url automatically. (Although this seems to be working normally, may I have ruined the original file?)

Things I've tried; 

* Putting the stylesheet link inside and outside of the include.php. 
* Putting the CSS file in a CSS folder and inside of the root folder.
* Check the consoles in different browsers (Firefox, Chrome) to see if I can find any linking errors. But ironically they both can find the file in the browser, but can't seem to link the HTML with the CSS preventing the attributes from working. 
* Double(triple, quadruple) checking names and typo's. 
* Simply removing the include.php to see how basic the issue is. And it is.. really basic. Hence my confusion.

i9syyc,"Lots of data for select option, quick way to write?","Hello!

Since November last year I've been learning html, CSS and JavaScript. Long long way to go but so far I'm loving it. I've recently been developing a website  [www.ohmydawg.co.uk/home.html](http://www.ohmydawg.co.uk/home.html)  to put what I've learnt to the test and keep on learning too. I am very aware that a lot more needs to be done on the site. But my question is this...

At the moment the user needs to type in the dog breed. To prevent spelling errors and also to make it much easier to identify how many of each breed are on the site I believe I should change this to a Drop Down selection box....

&lt;select name=""breed"" id=""breed"" placeholder=""What¬†breed¬†are¬†you?"" required&gt;    


&lt;option value=""Afghan¬†Hound""&gt;Afghan¬†Hound&lt;/option&gt;    


....

&lt;/select&gt;      


However there are hundreds of breeds so this would take a significant amount of time to write all this code. Surely there is a better option for me? or am I meant to persevere and just get typing. Just seems very long winded...

TIA

Also if you would like to upload your dog, That would be awesome!

i95nfs,Fixing Canvas Size to a dynamic value,"I'm working on an HTML page, and I have a question about page size. My website has elements that depend on the size of the page. So far, I've been trying to 'dynamically' set their width and height through CSS such that they will resize/reposition themselves accordingly every time the page size changes, like when you drag it across one monitor to another. This is done through setting the width and height of elements to some percentage of 'vh' and 'vw'.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm facing is that I can't do the same with canvas elements. This is important as my drawings in canvas depend on the canvas size. I tried to set canvas width and height just like my other HTML elements, but it didn't work. Setting it like this via CSS causes the entire canvas to become blurry. Is there a way to 'readjust' canvas size based on the size of the page? If not, is there a way to fix the entire page size to a certain width/height?

So bit of backstory... At the start of quarantine, I decided to teach myself HTML and CSS and create myself a website.

Because this was my first ever website that I programmed and made myself, it looked okay, but there was a lot of room for improvement. 

So I was looking for a new domain and found that Fred's Fashion had become available - so I decided this would be the perfect opportunity to completely redesign my website and make it more user and mobile-friendly. I spent a long time trying to perfect the design but I finally think that I have done a good job and I have created something that I am proud of.

I don't want to reference external websites (like ""[https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css)"" or ""[https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js)"" because it's very likely that the computer running this website won't have internet access.

Is it possible for me to download these libraries (if that is even the right term) to a local folder and reference them locally instead of through a website?

If that is possible, would the rest of the code to develop the multilayer dropdown look the same?

Thanks in advance",5,html,2020-10-13
i1yu4r,A website for learning the basics,"[AuraCoder](http://auracoder.com)

I built this website on my own and this is my first time putting it out there. Its still a work in progress but the basics are definitely there.

I think it's a pretty solid way to learn the basics. There's lessons, reviews, and online workspaces. Everything you need in one spot.

Very interested in feedback, appreciate anyone willing to check it out.",27,html,2020-10-13
i1po78,Foreground without blocking functions,"I have a normal website with some pictures in it. When I hover over the pictures 
 with the mouse it plays a short audio. Now I want to insert a big black dot as a foreground picture. And this dot will cover some pictures. Now with this I still want to use the hover function even if the pictures are being covered. 

it looks like this and the dots size will change if I navigate to another page:

i1mofw,html - mso conditional statement in outlook not working,"Hi. I need help with mso conditional statement in outlook.  
I‚Äôm customizing the Opt-in confirmation email template in Form builder Mailchimp for a project.  
When I sent a test everything looks great in Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook web mail client, except for the Outlook desktop app v16.0, which I have a spacing rendering issue.  
The cause of the problem was the ‚ÄúConfirm Subscription link/button‚Äù from the form builder, that generates the \`&lt;br&gt;\` tag after it, which outlook desktop app didn‚Äôt ignore, unlike other email clients.  
To fix the issue, I tried to add CSS style for \`&lt;br&gt;\` tag and display it none but it didn‚Äôt seem to work.  
I also used mso conditional statement to target this specific version of outlook desktop app. I added padding-bottom in \`&lt;td&gt;\` of a first text and place it inside mso, to have an equal spaces. But unluckily, outlook desktop still didn‚Äôt acknowledged it. I tried many things adding css, margin, etc., nothing works. Any idea how to fix this? It seems that I did something wrong with mso.

Here is my code:  
I have to split my HTML into two parts to make the ‚ÄúConfirm subscription link‚Äù in the middle. Since this link was unable to remove.

Everything works great on Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook web email client, except for the Outlook desktop app v16.0, which I have a spacing rendering issue. I used mso conditional statement to target this specific version to fix the problem. But it doesn't seem to work the margin-bottom that I added in &lt;td&gt;  and wrapped in mso statement didn't acknowledge. Any idea how to fix this?.

Here is the attached rendered email in outlook and gmail.

i0kdlt,MHTML File not showing box objects.,"Hello,

I have been saving Webpages as MHTML to view on IE. They are Multiple Choice Box surveys that show the correct answers and wrong ones per question that are next to each other. But after saving it as MHTML, I am only able to view one answer (object). I cannot see the marked answer if  I choose the wrong one.

&amp;#x200B;

So  I cannot see the correct answer I made if I chose the wrong one. I did not realize this before until now. I do not know if something changed within the way my browser works or if I just never noticed it?

Is there any major difference between closing the tags in the opposite of the opening tags instead of in the same order or just randomly?

hyz5tq,Best Practice HTML Signature (Images and Logos),"I never had contact with HTML until a few weeks ago and learned very quickly, that HTML Mail signatures can be a nightmare.

I tried base64 encoded images and hosted images. Nothing seems to be very realiable when it comes to different mail clients. Outlook 365 seems to work fine with base64 encoded images, but Outlook 2016 has some trouble (red x). Outlook for Android is also working fine, however Samsung Mail client is completely distroying the signature and seems to send only-text back with all logos attached. 

Hosted images seem to work fine, when you ""whitelist"" the sender, although I think most companys are blocking auto-download from external sources per policy. 

I dumbed down my code to have only some table rows and all my styling elements directly in the &lt;td&gt; tag as I learned Outlook is not compatible with modern HTML styling. Only the images and logos are a problem at the moment. 

What are your current best practices for HTML Signatures when it comes to images and logos besides not messing around with logos and images?

Is MIME / CID tags the best way? If so, can someone explain how this would be done using Outlook for example, as I do not understand the tutorials I found for this topics so far.

hxfdt8,Can I ask for help with some HTML code?,"Greetings.

For starters, let me say that I know nothing at all about HTML. The code I am about to paste below was cobbled together from Google searches.

I am a sysadmin and we use Office 365 for email. A long time ago I was tasked with placing a ""disclaimer"" in every e-mail message originating from a sender outside of our organization, so that a user would see a large red box of text letting them know that the email didn't originate within our organization to help with phishing. Office 365 has a spot to type in some text for this message and it will append it to the top of every email. It's just a completely blank text box and you are allowed to use HTML for formatting.

Here is the current product: [https://imgur.com/a/OYIWWl7](https://imgur.com/a/OYIWWl7)

We recently got a new CEO, and he is asking for more space between the bottom of the text box and the text of the email. Microsoft doesn't give me any way to control that, so I have to incorporate it in to my code. So I just need like one ""empty blank line"" below the red text box, if that makes sense.

If someone could offer some help I would appreciate it.

Here is the code:

&lt;HTML&gt; 

&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt; 

&lt;BODY&gt; 

&lt;div style=""background-color:#F56B6B; border:2px solid black;""&gt;

hwhv30,Properly closing an embedded video that opens in a pop-up,"Not sure how much html is exactly concerned, here, anyway I'll explain as short and clear as I can.

What I need: a link button that opens a pop-up with an embedded video (from YouTube). You click, it opens and plays; you click out of the video, it closes and bye bye.

What I'm using and: Drupal 8, with Colorbox and Colorbox Inline modules. I put an iframe of the video in the page, using the following code:

`&lt;a data-colorbox-inline="".featured-video""&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;`  
`&lt;iframe class=""featured-video"" width=""854"" height=""480"" src=""`[`https://www.youtube.com/embed/qN3OueBm9F4?autoplay=1`](https://www.youtube.com/embed/qN3OueBm9F4?autoplay=1)`"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;`

and the button opens it in a pop-up. Works fine, up to this point. Colorbox Inline requires that the element to show in the pop-up is already present on the page (I tried Colorbox Load too, but couldn't make it work).

Problem #1 is that the video shouldn't be visible in the page, only inside the pop-up when it's opened. I can hide it with display: none and only return it to display: block once the iframe is inside Colorbox, but I suppose this is bad practice. Maybe there is a good practice that even cancels problem #2?

Problem #2 is the one I can't currently evade even with bad practice: when I close the pop-up, the video in the page, albeit hidden with display: none, restarts and you can hear its audio. How can I disable its audio, or better, not make it start at all (while maintaining the autoplay in the pop-up) so it doesn't consume resources?

Any advice?  
Thanks in advance.",1,html,2020-10-13

For example say Wikipedia, each article on Wikipedia has the header, sidebar, etc. And obviously when they want to edit one element of the sidebar, they don't have to edit every single article.

I want to do the same with my site. I know you can have a separate CSS file to edit styles en masse, but I want to edit everything, not only styles. Say I have 10 pages with the same sidebar, header etc. and suddenly I decide to edit some text inside of it. Can I have like a link to a template HTML file that all other pages will use? Again sorry if this is dumb.",10,html,2020-10-13

hviv92,Trying to understand why I can't view properly formatted CSS after I save a website locally,"I logged into my [sentr](https://sentr.io)y.io dashboard, and I wanted to see what their html/css looked like.

So I decided to copy all the html in the chrome inspector, and saved that in a local .html file.

But, when I tried to open that html file locally in my browser, I got a blank white screen with this console error: [https://i.imgur.com/cbfF54q.png](https://i.imgur.com/cbfF54q.png)

I then found that if I removed this \`&lt;script&gt;\` tag from the html file, then the error went away

     &lt;script src=""https://s1.sentry-cdn.com/_static/c9741e356b3baef36e809d5543cbf45e/sentry/dist/vendor.js"" crossorigin=""&amp;quot;anonymous&amp;quot;""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

But, after I did that, even though the page loaded, the entire page lacked all its formatting.

Here's the original sentry site: [https://i.imgur.com/1NADcZf.png](https://i.imgur.com/1NADcZf.png)

Here's the one I downloaded and after I removed that script tag: [https://i.imgur.com/RsJwpeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/RsJwpeT.png)

&amp;#x200B;

If someone could explain, I thought that if I have the html and css of a page, then I shouldn't need any javascript to render it? All the html and css is found in the page at the time I downloaded it, and its identical to the one on the sentry website.

But I don't understand why all the formatting is gone when I remove a script tag? This shouldn't be an issue with sentry being a React/SPA app since I downloaded the html/css after it was rendered.",1,html,2020-10-13

hvcodp,"[Starter Question] What's the best way to load the content of big &lt;pre&gt; texts? Storing them in js, having a lot of them and changing their display?","I have a game that's kind of incremental with some rpg elements, and I want it to have a combat system. It's already setup, with objects for every enemy and scaling according to their levels, I'm pretty proud of it. I wanted the enemies to have a visual representation, and due to the simple game style I decided to go with ascii art in &lt;pre&gt;.

The only problem I now have is that I don't know if I should put every enemy ascii art on a &lt;pre&gt; and only show the current one battling the enemy, if I should keep every ascii art in different string variables, if I should read them from another document only when starting the battle (which I thought about but couldn't found how to do it or if it's possible), or if there's a better approach I didn't think of.

I know it may not be a big deal but i'd still like to get used to the best possible practices (and understand them) and it would make my html and js files a lot easier to read if neither had a walltext of ascii art.

hv3rqw,Need help determining appropriate button width. (Image with full code in comments),"I'm trying to make a webpage with four in-line buttons directly below the header. My criteria for these buttons are:

* All four buttons should be of even width
* There should be no space between the buttons
* The combined width of all the buttons should be the full width of the viewport
* The buttons should automatically resize to fit the viewport

The most logical solution I could come up with was to make a button group, so I did. It looks like this:

.btn-group button{

border: none;

	color: red;

	width: 25vw;

height: 7vw;

float: left;

	text-align: center;

	font-size: 2vw;

	cursor: pointer;

}

The width setting of 25vw is not working out as I had hoped, and the farthest right button is moving down to the next line. If I change the width setting to something lower (for example, 24.77vw,) all four buttons fit in my viewport until I resize it. I soon as I make the window smaller, the right button moves down to the next line again. I've tried a number of different things that I found on w3schools, css-tricks, and a couple other websites that result in either the same issue, or forces my second and fourth buttons out of vertical alignment. I've gotten to the point now where I don't even care if there's space between the buttons as long as they're equidistant and scale to the viewport.

Does anybody have any advice?",3,html,2020-10-13

htp7ge,Header image has no margins and slightly discolors navigation bar,"Hi All,

This is a pretty niche and specific question that involves injecting HTML into the header of a Squarespace website. I hope it is appropriate to post here.

I have a Squarespace site where I host an online profile for professional purposes, but also a blog and a podcast. I am trying to get the blog/podcast part of the site to be a little bit more distinctive so that when people are there, they see the name of the blog, no matter which post they are viewing.

Squarespace does not allow you to customize a header for just one page unless you inject HTML into it. I have done so, but in a really hacky way (not sure it is relevant, but I explained it at the bottom of this post anyway).

It looks close to how I want it but there are nor margins on the left are right even though the transparent PNG file I referenced has them built in. For some reason it also made the black color slightly darker than the rest of the navigation bar. 

Here is an example of the main blog page: [musicedtechtalk.com](https://musicedtechtalk.com)

And the header on a normal page of my website: [robbyburns.com](https://robbyburns.com)

Any guidance is appreciated!

ht3mzd,HTML Flexbox Layout Issues with widths stretching the layout,"Video Walkthrough: [https://streamable.com/sr5ygg](https://streamable.com/sr5ygg)  


I'm having some issues with a current UI I'm working on. I've been banging my head against this for a couple of days now.

I have a flex driven layout that is not doing exactly what it is I would like it to do.

I'm using Angular Kendo Grid which has a feature that allows users to resize the columns in the data grid. The intended functionality is that if users extend the columns passed the width of the screen real estate that the grid then becomes scrollable on the horizontal. This horizontal scrolling is pre-baked into the Kendo Grid component.  


The issue that I'm having ( explained in detail in the video ) is that when users extend the column width it stretches the parent and doesn't allow for the grid to be horizontally scrollable.  


**NOTE:** I've attached a video walkthrough of exactly what issues I'm running into. If you have any suggestions on how I could make this work it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",6,html,2020-10-13
ht2191,First Website Help!,"Hello, I'm very new at HTML to please let me know if something I've said doesn't make sense/is unclear! I'm wondering if there is a way to make an element (specifically a sidebar) that I want to put in my base.html optional to render. For example, I do not want the sidebar to show on my index.html page but I want it shown on other pages.

Also what is the proper way to put a more pleasing amount of space between the first name, last name, and email elements?

hs2bxh,Need Help with Background Image Coding,"Hello folks! I want to apologize in advance - I don't know much about coding so I hope this is the correct subreddit to post this. But I need some help if no one minds the time :D

I am building a website and I have a prewritten script I'm attempting to alter. Specifically the background color/image. I know just enough about HTML/CSS to have found the location within the code files where the current background-color was placed. The folder basically consists of a bunch of .css scripts tied together in in a style.css. The background-color is located in a file called 'colours.css' - see the screenshot below. I changed the HTML color code from a white to a blue in order to test that I actually had the right location. It worked and so now the background is this blue color.

Page after code change: [https://i.imgur.com/4nqzrNB.png](https://i.imgur.com/4nqzrNB.png)

Ideally, though I want to implement a background-image, rather than a color. The issue is I dont know exact how to write the value. The code folder has its own 'images' folder where every image used in the style is found as an .svg. I \*assume\* this is where I would place the wanted image as an .svg, but not sure how I would write the code to make it know where to find the image. 

Plus I know that there are likely other codes I need to add to make the image act the way I want it to. I'm just not sure which ones, such as background-position, height, etc. I want the image to be full sized, scrolling with the page, going behind the white box in the middle that holds all the content.

I hope this all makes sense, I'm not a coder I only know the \*tiniest\* bit of HTML/CSS. Please let me know if I need to provide more details or screenshots, I'm more than happy to.",2,html,2020-10-13

I'm hosting a website on Linode (Apache2 on Ubuntu) and I have created a rather simple website which explicitly has no Cookies and does not use any external content (such as Facebook Pixel / Like or a Youtube Video). Every content on this site comes from the webserver itself (to my knowledge, I don't use any analytics or anything it's just blank html basically in my /html folder in Apache2).

However just today I saw that when clicking on the lock (https is in use) that one cookie is in use:

[https://imgur.com/II5qUl0](https://imgur.com/II5qUl0)

""acceptCookies"" with value ""true"". What does it mean (googling ""acceptCookies"" is basically impossible)? And who do I get rid of it? I want specifically not any cookie on my site. Even if it isn't really doing anything, to a visitor it seems like there is one since Chrome (or any other browser) notices it as a cookie.

I might relearn it, so to what extent should I relearn HTML (and CSS for that matter) in terms of website development, so it at least has decent functionality and appearance (so I can move onto Javascript), and also, should I learn them before Javascript?",2,html,2020-10-13
hre2uw,Starting Coding and wanting to feel 100% confident,"I have kind of an open-ended question for anyone who is learning HTML or is already fairly comfortable.

I've known how to use basic HTML since I was maybe 16 (I'm 31 now). I never use it, and I assume like any other language your knowledge goes away, so I keep finding myself taking new lessons or practicing. 

I want to get comfortable with HTML, CSS and JS (in that order) so I could all things equal call myself a front end dev of sorts. In my head, I somehow feel like I cannot move onto CSS until I am 110% on HTML, and same for JS ‚Äì‚Äì¬†I would want to be 110% on CSS until I moved on. 

1. Is that a normal feeling? Wanting to be totally proficient before moving on? Or does it make more sense to tackle them all at the same time? Since they're all different languages I feel like learning all 3 at the same time would be harder.
2. Can you really ever ""speak"" HTML or CSS or JS like you would a language like French or Spanish? For instance, is someone who is proficient at writing up some HTML need to reference tags or other elements or does it just come to them naturally as if they were writing in a language they were fluent in? It's hard for me to believe someone could be fluent in a particular language in this way, it feels helpless.

I think overall I am feeling overwhelmed with learning a new language so late in life even though my brain does feel partially primed to learn it from being introduced younger. But I can't shake that ""I want to know everything so I can feel comfortable and confident"" feeling.",2,html,2020-10-13

so im trying to make a multilingual page right now. i managed to translate the content but as soon as you hit the language button all the css disappears. The links are not functioning after the translation as well. So basically after the translation no css and no html seems to be working properly. 

I provided a js.fiddle below.

ho00kq,Can I only color the outside of a table or should I nest two tables?,"Hey everyone,

I have a table in html. The table has many cells and columns. I only want the outside of the table to have a border and color but not the cell rows and columns within it. Is it possible to do this, or should I just nest two tables together; one with the border and border color without the columns and rows and a nested one within it with the columns and rows?

Thanks",7,html,2020-10-13

hnly5r,Working with &lt;time&gt; elements,"Take, for instance, the following phrase: ""We've been in business for 30 years."" 

I'm reading the docs at w3.org and MDN and I see you can do a `datetime` duration value for weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds, but not years or months (because years and months aren't a consistent number of seconds). So I'm not sure what, if anything, I should do to the example phrase above.

Should none of it be wrapped n a `&lt;time&gt;` element? Should just ""30"" be wrapped? Should ""30 years"" be wrapped? Should I set a datetime attribute? If so, would it just be YY or YYYY?

Sorry to blurt out so many questions, I just learned about the &lt;time&gt; thing recently, so maybe I'm going a bit overboard with the implementation üòÖ

Edit: I decided to alter my PHP to only use the `&lt;time&gt;` element when displaying a single year and leave it off for the range of years.

[https://i.imgur.com/RXFJPE9.png](https://i.imgur.com/RXFJPE9.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is that users can easily build notes by clicking on the purple buttons with sentences in them.

As each button is clicked, the sentence copies itself into the sky blue text box above.

Then, at the end, the user can add additional custom notes if they wish.

When the user is done, they click the Copy All Text Above button and everything in the sky blue text box gets copied into the clipboard.

Any suggestions on language(s) for building something like this?  It's just going to be hosted locally in an HTML file that runs in Chrome.  I have no idea where to start.  So, if someone could please point me to the languages needed to accomplish this, that would help!

I'll figure out the rest.

So I started learning HTML via Udemy, but it got me thinking for example in the networking field (which I need to put on pause for a while) when you want to use a video course that will give you the best information out there you use CBT Nuggets, IT Pro TV or Boson which are the most popular and respected ones.

What would be their counterpart in the coding world, is there like a gold standard video course or books that are recommended or is it just learn from where you can?

hjlpg5,Datalist values vs selection values?,"Please forgive any errors in my this submission as this is quite literally my first interaction with this website.

I realized that in a datalist, the options' values show up in the drop-down, and do not require any text between the opening and closing tags. This is not the case with the selection options, as those require text between the tags. When text is added between the datalist tags, it shows up as secondary text in Google Chrome. Can anyone explain why?",1,html,2020-10-13

This is homework, but I've tried solving it; I'm not posting this without any effort being put in beforehand.
I've already tried messing with margins, alignment, and padding for nav in the css file and none of them are giving the result I want.

~~Also now that I'm looking at it side by side, I'm realizing that something else is wrong, but I'm not sure what. something about how on mine the line border goes all the way across the bottom of the page, but in the example it stops at the sidebar.~~ Edit: fixed this by putting the footer inside &lt;main&gt;.

hjfwnl,Coder Suffering from Brain Mush- Help needed to make banner go with the length of content,"I think I got lost in my own code and my brain is too numb to figure this out.  
How can I get the banner (top of page w/ name of course) to extend out like the dynamic content?

Also, how do I get it to not squish the image in? 

maybe I missed a line and screwed up somehow.

hi53qn,"I want to learn REACT. I don't know HTML/CSS/Javascript or anything, other than the barest of bones. Where to start on this quest?","I wasn't sure if this was the right subreddit to post in, but let me explain why I posted this question here:

Basically I'm a production graphic designer who's always worked primarily in print or just web graphics, but never ever really with code or website building. I'm trying to broaden my horizons and move into UX as I think it's a solid change to broaden with. React seems to be a worthwhile endeavor but realistically I'm assuming though that it may be years off until I can *""master""* HTML/CSS first. If so, **to what level do I learn HTML/CSS to before** I start trying to learn Javascript?

hi1pl8,E-mail signature white space issue (GMAIL),"Hello everyone,

I'm asking this here, because i can't find my solution too bad, and no one responds on stackoverflow, so you guys are my last hope!

I'm building a kinda simple e-mail signature, but i'm finding issues when opening the email in gmail on my iphone (this is the only client having this issue.. others are doing fine)

When i send the e-mail it's adding space above and bewow the items, causing extra white space on in gmail.

The code (blow) is a stripped down version of what i want, because i'm trying to fix it lol. Adding margin: 0; padding: 0; line-heights etc on everything but ZERO things are working. So i hope someone here has the solution.

This is what i get in gmail when i fully make the signature:  [https://imgur.com/cHQ2KJz](https://imgur.com/cHQ2KJz)

I need to map out the images using React.js, but the methods I have tried display the ""broken image/ image not found"" icon on the browser, or break the app.

I have tried out writing the image paths on the json file as follows:

    ""img"" : ""url(../assets/images/Furever.jpeg)"", ""img"" : ""url('../assets/images/Furever.jpeg')"" ""img"" : ""Mission_Booked.jpeg"", &lt;--- No path, just file name. ""img"": ""../assets/images/jojo.jpeg""

And I have tried to map them as:

    &lt;img src={post.img}/&gt; &lt;img src={url(""`{$post.img}`"")}/&gt; &lt;img scr={require(post.img)}/&gt;  all the above as well but using closing img tags instead of self closing ones

As well as some other combinations. I used ""require"" because that's an answer that I found online, but it didn't work because I don't have webpack installed.

I used an extension on VSC that completes the paths as you type, to make sure you don't have a typo or wrote the path wrong.

Everything else that I am mapping through is populating on the browser perfectly.

hh02jv,Website-Design: How could I let a user change the order of a list manually?,"Hello there!

I need to ""design""/write a website, where the user is able to alter the order of items in a list.

So: I have a list (more specifically, its a .txt with one entry per line, all entries have the same length) with roundabout 20-30 items. The user needs to be able to say item#12 should be in position#2 instead, and all other items follow up (so, item#2 would be in pos#3 then, item#3 in  pos#4, etc).

In addition (which makes this a lot harder to think of a solution for me): the user only has a (relatively small) touchscreen as an input device.

I have all the usual stuff to work with; html, js, php, ...

It wouldn't need to be a fancy solution, it just would need to work (also, I don't essentially need you to write the code for me, I just need a little bit of input on what's possible and how I could solve my problem!)

hgrdu6,How can I avoid superimposition of image on website text ? Please help,"Hello,

I'm using a web based modeling tool for steam systems, where users enter system information and the website builds a schematic of the overall system. Link:

[https://www4.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/tech\_deployment/amo\_steam\_tool/baseDiagram](https://www4.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/tech_deployment/amo_steam_tool/baseDiagram)

**My problem:**

The system diagram (showing the components of the steam system) are superimposed on the text in the background, instead of being on a clean white background - this is a problem for me since I can't take a clean screenshot for reports or presentations. 

Here's a screenshot to illustrate: [https://imgur.com/61SKtLT](https://imgur.com/61SKtLT)

**Troubleshooting:**

1. I've tried the same website on Chrome, Safari, Opera and Edge (on both Mac and Windows bootcamp) with same results.  
2. I've tried printing the page to PDF with same results. 
3. I've tried changing the zoom % with same results.

**My Query:**

Is there anything I can do to get a clean diagram without it being mashed up with the background text?

For a clear understanding of what I'm looking for, please watch this video (0:17) which shows the diagram on a clear background: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=17&amp;v=FA8exTZanm0&amp;feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=17&amp;v=FA8exTZanm0&amp;feature=emb_logo)

&amp;#x200B;

Where $c is an array with pagenumbers and $page is just the page returned from the address bar.  If I use the code on individual page for a for/next page singularly it works. However when I change the iincrement to 10 it works as long as the page is max $c exactly, if however I go from say page 41 in an array with a maximum of 50 it jumps to 51 rather than respecting the $c maximum of 50.

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies iff this is slightl confusing I am new to all of this and my code is probably horrible.",6,html,2020-10-13

hdvx6q,My HTML lesson,"Hi guys,

So i've found myself on reddit due to a course on web design i'm doing and for the life of me i can't understand why it's taken me so long to get on here. Anyways, i'm here with my first HTML course project, it's based on a story about the frog and the scorpion which is a short but IMO deep insight into the topic of human nature and how we can't always fight our own individual natures.

&amp;#x200B;

Here it is:

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;
      &lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"" initial-scale=""1.0""&gt;
      &lt;meta name=""keywords"" content= ""fables"", ""frog"", ""scorpion"", ""HTML"", ""Learning""&gt;
                                                                           
      &lt;title&gt;Fables: the Frog and the Scorpion&lt;/title&gt;
      
      &lt;u&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Frog and the Scorpion: Innate Trait vs Survival&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    
      
      &lt;p&gt;The story of the frog and the scorpion has always been a peculiar story to me, peculiar to me in that it was literally a tale of how,
       &lt;ol&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;Evil can happen without justification&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;Kindness does not always return more kindnes&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;/ol&gt;
      
      for the benefit of those who may not be familiar with the tale, the story centers around a meeting &lt;br&gt; between a frog and a scorpion at a river bank. The scorpion intends to cross the river but being a non aquatic creature, it does not have the tools or means to cross. which is where the frog comes into the picture.
      
      
       
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          The scorpion ask the frog to allow it stay on its back while the frog swims across the river so it may successfully cross the river. The frog refuses immediately, saying that he is talking to a scorpion who will surely sting it (the frog) the first chance it gets. &lt;br&gt;
          The scorpion pleads with the frog until the frog reluctantly agrees to carry the scorpion on its back so that they may cross the river. 
          
          
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
       Halfway across the river the frog feels someting on its back, and quickly realises that the scorpion has stung it. ""Why"", the frog asks, ""why would you sting me when you know that you will drown as i die"" &lt;br&gt;
        The scorpion simply replies ""I am a scorpion, it is my nature to sting"", and so they both died at the bottom of the river.
         &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h3&gt;A video illustration&lt;/h3&gt;
         
      &lt;iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmEV5lBy9D0"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen&gt;
        &lt;/iframe&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now at the story it is easy to view the scorpion as &lt;s&gt;evil&lt;/s&gt; complicated, but it is, in my opinion a commentary on the undeniable aspects of human behaviour
        that exists at a fundamental aspect of our unique individualism.&lt;br&gt; That there are certain behavioural patterns that we each have that is ingrained in each of us that we
        can at best unlearn, and at worse express to the fullest at cost to &lt;strong&gt;ourselves or others&lt;/strong&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      I've always believed that to key to understanding a person should, where possible, include an understanding of their individual nature. Additionally, when we understand that we must never be ignorant of it unless we wish to regret our choices like the frog did.
      
      
    &lt;/body&gt;
    
    &lt;/html&gt;

I tried to use a few tags in it, like a &lt;meta&gt; tag to help potential search engine optimization, a couple of other tags for style and structural effects, but i mostly tried to keep the story simple and my thoughts concise, plus i put a little video in there in case anyone gets tired of reading.

&amp;#x200B;

I know its a bit basic, but how else am i going to learn right,

thanks for your time, hope i didn't waste it

till next time

I am trying to create a responsive table almost exactly like what is seen here.

I tried this code.

&lt;div class=""table""&gt;  


&lt;div class=""table-2-1-col""&gt;  


&lt;div&gt;User&lt;/div&gt;  


&lt;/div&gt;  


&lt;div class=""table-2-1-col""&gt;

hdq0ez,How can I create &lt;area&gt; elements with a loop in HTML?,"I am working on making a calendar with different clickable boxes. These boxes are all part of one larger `.png` image, which is evenly divided into smaller boxes representing different weeks. 

These boxes should be made clickable and direct the users to different pages based on which box they are. I am using the &lt;map&gt; and &lt;area&gt; tags to do so. However, because there are many boxes which are evenly spaced out, I do not want to type out the &lt;area&gt; tags by hand, especially because they may change based on how many boxes (years) the user wants.

Below is the `index.html` file, and I already have the first box with its respective coordinates and link. However, I do not want to type out each coordinate and links by hand.

```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;Your Life Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Click on a specific box to be transported to that timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=""poster.png"" alt=""Life Calendar"" usemap=""#calendar"" width=""515"" height=""760""&gt;

    &lt;map name=""calendar""&gt;
        &lt;area shape=""rect"" coords=""0,0,5,5"" alt=""Week 1"" href=""#week-1""&gt;
    &lt;/map&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
```
Ideally, I would like to use a for-loop in JavaScript to dynamically create these &lt;area&gt; tags based on the user's desired number of boxes. Each box's x-coordinates would increase by 10 each time up to 520, then reset to 0 while the y-coordinates jump by 10 up to the variable `life_expectancy` (e.g. 76).

It does not need to have any other function than giving users the posibility to type in the desired amount of time in minutes.

hdbq3u,HTML Basics :,"**HTML** stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is not a programming language but a Markup Language. It is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example,¬†content could be structured within a set of paragraphs,¬†a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 

 **HTML** consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

Recently have completed a beginner level online course on **HTML** from ""**PIRPLE**"" Institute. I found this course very helpful for beginners into Web Development. Some of the topics which I learned, would like to share here:

**Basic HTML Tags :** 

&lt;html&gt;,&lt;head&gt;,&lt;title&gt; &amp; &lt;body&gt;

Basic Structure of HTML :

`&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;` \--  All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration  `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`   
`&lt;html&gt;` \--  Always The HTML document itself begins with &lt;html&gt; &amp; ends with &lt;/html&gt;

  
`&lt;head&gt; --`  Contains information for the document.  
`&lt;title&gt;`Page Title&lt;/title&gt; -- Defines the title of the document.   
`&lt;/head&gt;`  
`&lt;body&gt;` \--  Tag defines the document's body

Whatever we type *inside a body tag* that is visible to the user &amp; is displayed on the webpage. 

`&lt;h1&gt;`This is a Heading`&lt;/h1&gt;`  
`&lt;p&gt;`This is a paragraph.`&lt;/p&gt;`  


`&lt;/body&gt;`  
`&lt;/html&gt;` 

***Type of HTML Lists : Ordered &amp; Unordered List***

An **Ordered list** can be numerical or alphabetical

An **Ordered List** is written as &lt;ol&gt; &amp; closed as &lt;/ol&gt;. 

 *Example :* 

 `&lt;ol&gt;`  
  `&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;` (`&lt;li&gt;` tag is used to define each list item.)  
  `&lt;li&gt;Sugar&lt;/li&gt;`  
  `&lt;li&gt;Tea Powder&lt;/li&gt;`  
`&lt;/ol&gt;`

An **Unordered List**  tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list.

An **Unordered List** is written as `&lt;ul&gt;` &amp; closed as `&lt;/ul&gt;.`

*Example :*

 `&lt;ul&gt;`  
  `&lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;`  
  `&lt;li&gt;Tea&lt;/li&gt;`  
  `&lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;`  
`&lt;/ul&gt;` 

***Hyperlinks &amp; Images HTML Tags :***

 **Hyperlink Tag :**

This tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

The most important attribute of the &lt;a&gt;element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.  

*Example :* 

 `&lt;a href=""https://www.Yahoo.com""&gt;Visit Yahoo com!&lt;/a&gt;` 

 ""href"" -- Specifies the URL of the page the link goes to 

 By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue.

A visited link is underlined and purple.

An active link is underlined and red.

Image Tag :

 Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The &lt;img&gt;

tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

*Example :*

&lt;img src=""[https://imgur.com/CcQform](https://imgur.com/CcQform)""&gt;

***Audio &amp; Video Control Tags :***

**Audio:**

 The &lt;audio&gt; tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams. 

 The &lt;audio&gt;tag contains one or more &lt;source&gt;tags with different audio sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports. 

*Example :* 

 `&lt;audio controls&gt;`  
  `&lt;source src=""horse.ogg"" type=""audio/ogg""&gt;`  
  `&lt;source src=""horse.mp3"" type=""audio/mpeg""&gt;`  
¬† `Your browser does not support the audio tag.`  
`&lt;/audio&gt;` 

When we put &lt;Audio Controls&gt; it  specifies that audio controls should be displayed like play &amp; pause options.

**Video :** 

 The &lt;video&gt;tag is used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams. 

*Example :*

 `&lt;video Controls &gt;`

`&lt;source src=""movie.mp4"" type=""video/mp4""&gt;`  
`&lt;source src=""movie.ogg"" type=""video/ogg""&gt;`  
 `&lt;/video&gt;` 

When we put &lt;Video Controls&gt; it  specifies that audio controls should be displayed like play &amp; pause options.",2,html,2020-10-13

hbnaw7,"Arranging elements in a circle, evenly spaced","I'm trying to figure out the best way to arrange `div`s in a circle around an image.  I don't know how many `div`s there will be, but they should be evenly spaced, and the first one should always be centered at the bottom of the circle (6 o'clock).  Each div will also have sub-elements and should be centered as follows:

* If there is only one, it should be at 6 o'clock
* If there are two, they should be at 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock
* If there are three, they should be at 6 o'clock, 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock
* If there are four, they should be at 6:00, 9:00, 12:00 and 3:00

Et cetera.

Is there a way to do this with just HTML and/or CSS or do I need to use JavaScript and/or jQuery?  Will those even be enough or should I go full geometric, and use SVG?

Edit: I don't think I'm going to try to do it with just HTML/CSS.  My question now is should I use jQuery to position the `div`s, or use SVG to independently position each element within the `div`?  (Each `div` will contain several equally sized images.)",5,html,2020-10-13

hbkb0r,A HTML project: Creating a website on my favourite movie.,"I am doing an online HTML/CSS course on pirple.com. I had to create a webpage on my favourite book/story for a project. Since I hadn't read a book in a long time, I chose to do it on a movie. For those who are wondering, I chose Spider-Man Into the spider verse. 
I inserted a &lt;meta&gt; tag inside &lt;head&gt;. A &lt;meta&gt; tag defines metadata about an HTML document. I gave it the &lt;title&gt; movie reviews. I have used &lt;section&gt;, &lt;div&gt; and &lt;main&gt; tags to separate the contents. For critic reviews, I've used &lt;cite&gt; tag which indicates the text written is a citation. For the organisation name, I used &lt;b&gt; to make it bold and used &lt;mark&gt; to highlight the text.
I've inserted a poster from the movie using the &lt;img&gt; tag, specified it's height and width in pixels. To insert a youtube video, I searched for the video and clicked on share and then embed which gives the html code. I copied the code and pasted it there. It was an &lt;iframe&gt; tag that specifies an inline frame. At last I put a &lt;footer&gt; in which I put a form tag so that I could take feedback from the readers. I put two elements in it. One &lt;input type=""""&gt; tag  with type=text and another with type=button to submit. It was a great experience and I recommend this course for those who want to learn!

Edit: I created this before I learnt CSS. That is why it looks like that!",5,html,2020-10-13

h8yfzt,I need help......trying to create email generator in HTML. Can I do this?,"Hey guys,

I'm not really sure if this is the right way to go about this but most tutorials online don't really give me what I need in order to solve the issue I'm having to solve for.

I'm trying to make a email type of generator for our confluence page. Logic states that I use HTML as confluence supports the module. Much of the reason for this stems from a script someone made that allows them to input values like name, phone number, etc., and it outputs into an email template for someone to use. It takes each variable and input them into an template that outputs a full email message with said inputs.

My issue is that I can't figure out how to go about doing this. I originally thought of making a form that you input and then a submit button to output the text but I'm coming at this thing blind right now. I'm not really sure where to start, and much of what I've found online are for very rudimentary things.

TLDR; I need to make a email generator in confluence that will take all inputs and output into a email form. I've been looking at HTML but I don't know if there's an easier option.",13,html,2020-10-13

gvpiai,"Why do Safari links with target=""_blank"" download an HTML instead of opening the page in a new window?","Hi,

I have a page with some links like this:

`&lt;a href=""`[`https://something.com/url`](https://something.com/url/)`/"" target=""_blank""&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;`

gvp26b,What are relative paths vs absolute paths and how do they work in your HTML document?,"I am learning HTML on codeacademy.  I have come across this new concept of paths, and I think I partially understand but not fully.  From my understanding, relative paths direct to a link on YOUR website from your HTML file, while absolute paths point directly to a link.  

How does this work?  I was reading that relative paths are better in case you want to change domains.  Is this because if you are linking back to your own website pages with absolute paths, you will have to go back and manually change them all?   

Also, how does the file storage work with your different files linked to one larger file?  I‚Äôm not sure if it makes sense how I‚Äôm posing this question.

TL;DR How do HTML files work?  Especially when actually uploading them to your site and linking back to a certain ‚Äúpage‚Äù of a file with a relative link?",2,html,2020-10-13

gt9zd6,My fist HTML work and learnings after following few lessons in pirple.com,"I started to ""Learn HTML and CSS"" course at ""pirple.com"". Just completed a couple of sections. I learned how to create an HTML file and some basic things. it can be classified as follows.

* HTML stands for ""*Hyper Text Markup Language*""
* All HTML documents should start with  `&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;`
* Then we should start with `&lt;html&gt;` and end `&lt;/html&gt;`  (This is root element of an HTML page)
* `&lt;head&gt;` section basically contain meta detilas about the document
* `&lt;title&gt;` section define Title for the HTML page
* All parts that show in the Html page should add to `&lt;body&gt;` and `&lt;/body&gt;`
* We can define 6 headers in Html  `&lt;h1&gt;` to `&lt;h6&gt;` tags
* paragraphs can be start and end with `&lt;p&gt;`and `&lt;/p&gt;`
* We can add various kind of lists in HTML eg: ordered list (Numbered list) ""`&lt;ol&gt;`"", unordered list (bullet lists)""`&lt;ul&gt;`"" etc. (This help us to  group a set of relevant items) . We can create list with `&lt;li&gt;` tags (list)
* Normally tags come with an opening tag and closing tag in HTML.
* we can add comments in our HTML document and it will not show in the web browser . use this syntax to add comments `&lt;!-- This is comment --&gt;`

This is simple HTML page looks like

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    
    &lt;h1&gt;My Basic HTML &lt;/h1&gt;
    
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

Here is a simple HTML page that I created after the following few lessons in ""pirple.com"". I have added comments to needed sections.

This is a simple page for a vegetable soup recipe. I have used headings, paragraphs, lists and comments.

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;healthy vegetable soup recipe&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!-- Title for the page --&gt;

       &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1 stalk celery chopped&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1 head cauliflower or broccoli chopped&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1 cup green beans, corn, chopped tomato, or other vegetables&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3-4 cups chopped leafy greens such as kale, collards, spinach, watercress or broccoli rabe&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steps to Make It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;!-- first level heading with italics --&gt;
      &lt;!--  ordered list --&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Heat the olive oil in a soup pot. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook for 5 minutes.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;!-- fourth level heading --&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Add the cauliflower, potato, leek, bay leaf, and thyme. Add enough water to cover the vegetables, as well as a generous pinch of salt.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Bring the soup to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat. Simmer the soup for about 20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Puree about half of the soup mixture.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Add the remaining vegetables of your choice: green beans, corn, tomatoes or anything else you've chosen. Cook until the greens are tender.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Season to taste and serve.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt; &lt;!-- End of body --&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

To view this on web browser follow the following steps

1. Copy entire HTML code
2. Create a new page in any editor (sublime text, notepad ++ etc) and paste it.
3. Save page as ""myrecipe.html"" (you can give any name but file extension must be a "".html"")
4. Then open it in the browser.

gryt4r,Getting better,"2nd post here, I just finished my 1st project in the html online course by pirple. Albeit it still doesn't look as good as the webs we see on the internet, I'm still proud of what I accomplished.

The project is about making a weboage about my favorite book series wherein I will use tags that weren't taught in the program. Here is the code

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;

    &lt;/head&gt;
       
    &lt;body&gt;
&lt;header&gt; 
    &lt;h2 style=""text-align: center;""&gt; Harry Potter is my favorite book series &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;!-- Style tags are used to make customizations to your contents --&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;main style=""align-content: center;""&gt; 
    &lt;h4 style=""text-align: center;""&gt; Here is a youtube video of my favorite scene in the Harry Potter movies &lt;/h4&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;!-- iframes are used to put youtube videos on your webpage without having to resort to using links--&gt;

&lt;!-- autoplay is used so that the video will play automatically once loaded--&gt;

   &lt;label for=""Lname""&gt; Last Name &lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;input type=""text"" id=""Lname"" value=""Enter Last Name"" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;label for=""Books""&gt; What is your favorite Harry Potter Book? &lt;/label&gt;

Navigation Styles

Go to the Navigation Styles section and create a style rule for the nav &gt; ul selector that removes all list markers, sets the line height to 2em, and sets the font size to 0.9em.

For every previously visited or unvisited hypertext link within the navigation list, create a style rule to remove the underlining from the hypertext link and to set the text color to rgb(43, 59, 125).

For every hovered or active link within the navigation list, create a style rule to set the text color to rgb(212, 35, 35).

This is what I have

/\* Navigation Styles \*/

nav &gt; ul {

gq93s8,Help? Cod not working?,"Well, I am very very new to learning coding and the first language I am learning is HTML so now I have seen how to make a file download with the ""download"" attribute but the problem is that anywhere I search how to do this I get the tutorial of doing it with this attribute but this code is not working for me. Can anyone help me?

&lt;a href=""/Users/user/Desktop/website/style/bullet.png"" download=""BulletPic.png""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;

This code should download a .png file named BulletPic.png but it is not downloading it but opening it in the browser.

And one more that none of the code online that I have seen includes the full path of the file they just start the path form the directory in which the webpage is stored but it is not working for me If I don't type the full path. It says File not found.

And one last thing that I have not set up this file on the internet yet, I am just opening this file locally by double-clicking the .html file does that make any difference?

Thanks in Advance.",3,html,2020-10-13

gpotua,Shifting elements with buttons with HTML/CSS,"[SOLVED]
Hello, I'm a beginner in web design, and I want to know how you would go about shifting elements vertically with on-screen buttons in HTML.

Basically, I have something along the lines of this example here: [https://codepen.io/marc-simplon/pen/vqYwYQ?editors=1010](https://codepen.io/marc-simplon/pen/vqYwYQ?editors=1010) which allows me to zoom in and out of an image (text in the example, but same thing essentially). However, it zooms in relative to the middle of the image, so the top of the image moves up and covers the zoom buttons (in the example, try zooming in a lot and you'll see how this becomes an issue)

So, I can simply add a function, that shifts my image up or down when I press the zoom buttons, right? If this is possible, can anyone link me to somewhere where shifting elements on the screen with buttons is explained? Or even just what element to use when moving elements on the screen?

Thanks!",10,html,2020-10-13

gog6t0,My HTML Homework,"**Hi! Just wanted to share with you what i learned in HTML**.

It is actually the basics, but here goes. Well, so far, I have been introduced with HTML and what it looks like. Basically, HTML it tells your browser(i.e Google Chrome) how to display web pages. Its code actually uses tags and elements to enclose different parts of the content, and this is what it looks like &lt;p&gt; (to open a tag) then &lt;/p&gt; (to close it). You can actually do it in another line, depending on how you want to customize it.

But more about that, I learned all about the content. And how knowing elements is very important in doing your codes. First line should start with &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; then followed by &lt;html&gt; in another line. Also there's &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; which consist elements. Also, you must not forget to end close the line off. Here is the example code that i did for my homework.   


&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;

  &lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;

  &lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width""&gt;

  &lt;title&gt;JS Bin&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

  &lt;!-- Unordered List --&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt; 

   &lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon McCormick¬Æ All Natural Pure Vanilla Extract&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;1/2 teaspoon McCormick¬Æ Ground Cinnamon &lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;1/4 cup milk&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;4 slices bread&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;!-- Ordered List --&gt; 

 &lt;ol&gt; 

   &lt;li&gt;Beat egg, vanilla and cinnamon in shallow dish. Stir in milk. &lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;Dip bread in egg mixture, turning to coat both sides evenly.&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;Cook bread slices on lightly greased nonstick skillet 

on medium heat until browned on both sides. &lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;Easy Spiced Syrup: Add 1 teaspoon McCormick¬Æ Pure Vanilla Extract 

and 1/4 teaspoon McCormick¬Æ Ground Cinnamon to 1 cup pancake syrup; 

stir well to mix.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ol&gt;

If I was in an office environment, I'd simply look for a mentor to slap me over the hand whenever I did something blatently dumb. However, it's not an option at the moment.

I don't know what I don't know, so I don't really know where to look. I mean I read articles on flexbox or CSS grid and get it conceptually, but it's not the same as doing it in production.

Any suggestions on how I can improve? I am building websites, but so long as they work - I'm not really learning anything. Only when they break.",12,html,2020-10-13

gmsrwy,Help with selecting an image as output in a webpage,"I am developing a webpage that I want to be able to use to open a Siri Shortcut on my iPhone/iPad and close the window. 
The basic structure is that I will have the webpage display a series of images and the user will press one of the images. When they press on the image the webpage will open shortcuts feeding in the name of the image which was pressed and close the webpage. 
I have come up with two ways to do this but neither work perfectly.

The first method uses classes and a JavaScript:

	&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
	
			&amp;lt;img class=""grayscale"" width=""150"" name=""Jack of Clubs"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/S34q0LQ.png""/&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;img class=""grayscale"" width=""150"" name=""Queen of Hearts"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/wlaRkKF.png""/&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;img class=""grayscale"" width=""150"" name=""King of Diamonds"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/8AoNupT.png""/&amp;gt;

			&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
			// Select all elements with the class name ""grayscale""
				const images = document.querySelectorAll('.grayscale');
			// Loop through each selected element
				images.forEach(image =&amp;gt; {
			// Start listening for cursor clicks...
					image.addEventListener('click', () =&amp;gt; {
			// open a shortcut with the clicked element's value
						window.open('shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Clue Card 4&amp;amp;input=text&amp;amp;text=hello jello'); window.close();
			//I want to replace ""hello jello"" with the img name from above
					 });
				});
			&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;

This works great but I can‚Äôt feed out the name of the selected image. The text ‚Äúhello jello‚Äù should be replaced with the name of the image but I don‚Äôt know how to do this. 

The second method uses a form. It can feed out the image name (although with + in place of spaces). However, it does not close the webpage after pressing it and cannot open shortcuts with spaces in their names. Here is the second method:

	&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;form action=""shortcuts://run-shortcut""&amp;gt;
				&amp;lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""name"" value=""ClueCards3""&amp;gt;
				&amp;lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""input"" value=""text""&amp;gt;
				&amp;lt;input type=""image"" class=""grayscale"" width=""150"" name=""text"" value=""Jack of Clubs"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/S34q0LQ.png""/&amp;gt;
				&amp;lt;input type=""image"" class=""grayscale"" width=""150"" name=""text"" value=""Queen of Hearts"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/wlaRkKF.png""/&amp;gt;
				&amp;lt;input type=""image"" class=""grayscale"" width=""150"" name=""text"" value=""King of Diamonds"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/8AoNupT.png""/&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;

I‚Äôm hoping to find something that modifies one of these to have all three of these criteria met:
1) can run files (shortcuts) with spaces in their names;
2) on press can export the pressed image item‚Äôs name; and
3) following press will close the webpage

Hi guys, I'm making a website that works with some img's and drag and drops.

But i have a problem put images together. I have a initial image static on the left. When I try to put other image on the right, next to him, they never stay fully together, they have a lit space dividing them. [You can see the problem here.](https://ibb.co/pPd1GBL)

&amp;#x200B;

All the other next images stay together, the first image have a different class, but it's almost the samething was the others.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the code:

Hello people,

I do now have any experience with HTML, I just started working with it yesterday just to make a simple website for my research team on github. My only knowledge from coding is matlab,r and python. Instead of building everything from scratch I downloaded a template from HTML5 UP and started tweaking it in visual studio code.

The template itself has some images which I would like to change. For some reason the new images are not recognized by visual studio. When I write the path of the files, there is a drop down menu with several jpg from the original template but not my new pictures which are in the same folder. If I go ahead and give the name of the new file nothing appears on the website, but when I change that file with any of the original images it works fine.

e.g.

&lt;img src¬†=¬†""images/pic02.jpg"" alt¬†=¬†""Test""&gt; Shows ""pic02"" that came with the template

In this situation I need to do this in a relatively small amount of code, but what would be really nice would be to display two buttons, one labeled ""OFF"" and one labeled ""ON"", with the one reflecting the current number in the file highlighted in some way (a colored background or something) but if you clicked the other button it would write the opposite value to the file and change the background color of the buttons, so you'd have a simple on/off toggle, however I imagine that now you're talking something that requires a fair bit of supporting code (if it can even be done in html only).  So for now I'd be happy to be able to just read the value of the file and display an appropriate phrase.",1,html,2020-10-13

gjqs42,"help with Tumblr theme, images keep stretching!","i have a tumblr blog (https://sherrysicle.tumblr.com) and i‚Äôm using a really old theme because it has a feature that lets you enlarge certain posts. however, the posts that are not enlarged gets stretched and i don‚Äôt know what to do! i‚Äôve looked at forums and websites but none of their solutions work, the original maker of the theme deactivated their blog so i can‚Äôt ask them, so i hope someone can help. here is the code:

https://pastebin.com/94AYqRaU

i must mention that i have absolutely zero coding experience. from experimenting i think [this](https://imgur.com/a/L5Gnf4Y) is the part of the code that affects the size. i‚Äôve tried replacing the imagesize with an actual number and that stops the stretching but it becomes way too big.

also, if anyone can help: when i reblog textposts the text won‚Äôt show up but the username will. i think you need knowledge of tumblr specific coding but if you know how to fix it that would be greatly appreciated as well, thanks in advance!!",6,html,2020-10-13

chrome extensions like uBlock origin, Bypass Paywalls and Universal Bypass don't work for the overwhelmingly vast majority of cases so I was wondering if it was possible to just build the webpage from scratch and just omit the lines of code that made the paywall.

I am trying to understand proper image exporting. I am getting into ui ux but want to learn how to better prepare assets for developers to make their lives easier.

One thing I struggle with mainly is trying to figure out how many versions of an image I should export so that as I shrink from web to mobile, the pictures decrease in size (cause you really don't need a 2000w picture wide pic on a mobile phone). Right now I am just browsing some clothing sites to see how they do it. I'll inspect a picture of a pair of shoes for example, and there's many versions of it varying from big file size to small all under that srcset attribute. Say I have my web page shrunk to a mobile size, is there any way to check what version of the original image I am currently viewing?  


I hope this makes sense. I work in Sketch, so would a normal use case be ‚Äì start with an image at its biggest size, then make multiple variations each smaller and smaller? If so, what suffix would you give each file name?",1,html,2020-10-13

ghaken,My first HTML course assignment - Pirple.com,"Recently I found out that there was a free HTML and CSS course on [Pirple.com](https://Pirple.com) so I decided to sign up and I am here to share what I have learned. I have learned how to define the document type to HTML and the basic structure of all HTML files that include Head, Body, and Paragraphs. After that, I learned how to create lists, both unordered and ordered.

Shortly after this, I was given my first assignment: create a simple HTML document with a recipe of my choosing using both kinds of list learned previously, which I will share and explain.

The items between &lt;!-- --&gt; are comments inserted in the program to aid in the understanding of the code, therefore they explain the purpose of each section.

`&lt;!-- defines the type of document --&gt;`

`&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`

`&lt;html lang=""en"" dir=""ltr""&gt;`

  `&lt;head&gt;`

`&lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;`

`&lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""&gt;`

`&lt;meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""ie=edge""&gt;`

`&lt;title&gt;Mac&amp;Cheese Recipe&lt;/title&gt;`

  `&lt;/head&gt;`

  `&lt;!-- This section marks the beginning of the code that the user sees --&gt;`

  `&lt;body&gt;`

`&lt;!-- Two headers of different sizes --&gt;`

`&lt;h1&gt;Simple Macaroni and Cheese Recipe&lt;/h1&gt;`

`&lt;h3&gt;Quick and easy fix to a tasty side dish.&lt;/h3&gt;`

`&lt;!-- a paragraph to separate the text from the image, this is used through the page to separate things --&gt;`

`&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;`

`&lt;!-- inserts an image of the recipe in question --&gt;`

`&lt;img src=""./images/mac-and-cheese.jpg"" alt=""""&gt;`

`&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`

`&lt;!-- another text formatted as header to introduce to the following unordered list --&gt;`

`&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;`

`&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`

`&lt;!-- this marks the beginning of the unordered list --&gt;`

`&lt;ul&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;1 (8 once) box elbow macaroni&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup butter&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;1/2 teaspoon salt&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;ground black pepper to taste&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;2 cups milk&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;/ul&gt;`

`&lt;!-- end of unordered list --&gt;`

`&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`

`&lt;!-- another text formatted as header to introduce the following ordered list --&gt;`

`&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;`

`&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`

`&lt;!-- this marks the beginning of the ordered list --&gt;`

`&lt;ol&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;li&gt;Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.&lt;/li&gt;`

`&lt;/ol&gt;`

`&lt;!-- end of ordered list --&gt;`

gf6wm4,Send an email in HTML," 

I there!

My question seems very basic... but it's not.

I   know most email clients have the ability to send emails in HTML  format:  generally, we just need to copy and paste our code in a text  box and  click on ""insert"". With a simple HTML, it'll work, of course.

But with a more complex code it's always a disaster. Yet my code is fine and compatible, believe me: I've wrote it with [MJML](https://mjml.io/). It's a great framework who generates a valid and email-friendly html code. (An example [here](https://mjml.io/try-it-live/templates/amario).) Anyway, for the most sceptical , I tested my generated code with the [PHP mail function](https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.mail.php) and it's displayed perfectly on all webmail, desktop apps, mobiles,...

The   problem is that all the email clients I've tried (Outlook, SeaMonkey,   Thunderbirds,...) systematically modify that code and delete/transform   themselves some HTML and CSS elements. Why are they doing this?

So, do you know a (free) program that can send HTML code without rewriting it? I can't understand why it's so hard to find.

(The php mail function is too simplistic for real use and the free versions of emailing softwares like [mailchimp.com](https://mailchimp.com/) never allow us to send our own code.)

Thanks a lot!

gewojf,Squaresspace: How do I link a folder title within the navigation to a page?,"hi everyone,

I'm using Squarespace to create my website. However squarespace doesn't allow you to link a page to a specific folder within the navigation. I want to link ""home page"" which is my page to ""English"" (which is the folder). So when someone who is on my website and clicks on ""English"" directs then to my home page.

I followed the following instructions and did not work.

1. Open the folder's settings/configuration window (click its gear icon in the Pages panel).
2. In the Navigation Title field, paste in:&lt;a href=""/PAGESLUG""&gt;NAME&lt;/a&gt;
3. Replace PAGESLUG with the slug for the page you want to link to. (Make sure the / is included.)
4. Replace NAME with what you want the folder's nav link to say.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I did.

1. I copied this &lt;a href=""/home""&gt;english&lt;/a&gt; in my ""English"" folders navigation title field.
2. I took the page slug of the ""home"" page that I want to link to the ""english"" folder. the pageslug of the home page is -&gt; home.

genwj3,Why aren't my images showing up?,"This is similar to something that I posted yesterday but I still don't really understand whats going wrong. I have a folder called Business. Inside Business is 4 folders. two of these folders are called CSSAndScripts and Media. I am working on a file inside of CSSAndScripts. I want the image glue.jpg to appear on the file but only the alt is showing up. I have it written as:

&lt;img src=""../Business/Media/glue.jpg"" alt=""Adhesive Formula"" width=""250"" height=""250""/&gt;

gelmbt,Images won't show as I want them to and button hover doesn't work,"I've just started with HTML and CSS and experienced some problems.

First of all, I tried placing 3 images in a column with underneath a text box. The first one show amazing. The second one shows, but the text box is on the rights side instead of under it. The third image doesn't want the be placed next to the 2nd image and it is totally stretched out. I have tried to remove the column and place it on the right place in CSS, but that doesn't work either. 

The second problems is: I have made a button which says 'Join Now'. I tried to apply the same hover effect, as I did with one of the buttons in the top right corner. And this doesn't work as well. I don't know much about hover, so I just copied the same as I did earlier.

I hope someone can solve my problems.

gek8ht,Automatically switch between two pages in HTML,"Dears,

I have two pages which comes from Excel output saved as .html files and are auto-republished once Excel file is saved. I publish it to factory internal view on TV server, but I can show only one page. If I want to show second page, I pick it from page browser manually. I want to schedule automatic switch that will swap between those two pages on TV every 10 seconds. TV uses Microsoft Edge to broadcast those pages. Is there any solution to schedule it as described?

geiehy,html+css different than actual website?,"So i coded some html/css files with jpgs, everything looked fine when I launched them. I also sent the files to my friends and they said it looked fine as well. However, when I created a domain and hosted it, the website looks totally different. The background image's gone, positioning's all over the place, text and images are overlapping etc. What could be the issue?

here's the code:

ge7jrn,Scaling whole table at once," Hi,

I am trying to scale down entire table. I need to have a org chart in company's wiki/sharepoint by Microsoft. As I am no expert (nor will be people keeping the table up to date) I create the table in excel and save it as html. Then open it in notepad and copy the whole code into the wiki. It looks exactly as in Excel but it is too big ( [https://imgur.com/a/Vv6xozM](https://imgur.com/a/Vv6xozM) ).

Is there a way to scale down the whole table? Or set page size and then copy the code into it?

I'll be grateful for any help or solution. The easier the better. Thank you

gdh7s0,Page renders Œ© as W - why would that be?,"A website I visit (it's not mine) has a page at:

[https://www.12voltplanet.co.uk/cable-sizing-selection.html](https://www.12voltplanet.co.uk/cable-sizing-selection.html)

The website source is

    This is the resistance of the conductor expressed in Ohms per metre (&lt;span style=""font-family: symbol;""&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;/m) and is important when determining voltage drop 

So it is trying to display a symbol, and the website owner says it *does* display omega.

My request is this: could you visit the page above, search for ""ohms"" and report what symbol you see? Also, report what hardware, OS and browser you are using. A few responses (ten?) should be enough!

edit: solved.

gd92ca,CSS file not loading on specific computer,"Hi, I'm working with one of my students via email and Google Hangouts to help her develop her website.  She's working in VS Code on a macbook.  Her browsers on her computer will not display the CSS that she has written in a separate file.

She has sent me the files and they load the CSS on my Windows PC &amp; laptop and I've also tested them successfully on my Macbook.  I have checked her code in the online validator.  She has cleared browser history and even moved the files to a new folder to isolate them and the CSS still won't load.  I cannot replicate the problem on my computers though.

When inspecting the web page on her computer, the CSS file is not showing under sources section but it does on my computers.

I am at a loss now unless somehow her computer is preventing the css loading?

Then, i have introduced a short description on how to make this cookie using unordered and order lists. &lt;body&gt; tag allows the visitors to analyse the paragraph you want to see.

gcrwea,HTML question pattern consistency failing after a few rows.,"Hey guys,   


I'm having an issue coding my page, and I also don't have much knowledge about html but my website is coming together slowly. In my **credits** section of my website (see below), I am sorting the images through multiple &lt;div&gt; 's trying to make 4 columns and indefinite amount of rows and what's happening is halfway down they're losing their pattern consistency.   


For example, from the first credit down, my code looks like:

  &lt;!-- 88GLAM --&gt;

&lt;div class=""credits-section col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-6""&gt;

&lt;a class=""d-block mb-4 h-100""&gt;

&lt;img class=""img-fluid img-thumbnail"" src=""img/Credits/88GLAM.jpg"" alt=""""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;88GLAM&lt;br&gt; Credits: Assistant Recording Engineer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- Ace of Wands --&gt;

&lt;div class=""credits-section col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-6""&gt;

&lt;a class=""d-block mb-4 h-100""&gt;

&lt;img class=""img-fluid img-thumbnail"" src=""img/Credits/AceOfWands.jpg"" alt=""""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ace of Wands&lt;br&gt; Credits: Assistant Recording Engineer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


and so on the exact same way, just changing pertinent information. I would like this to be an indefinite list because the credits list will continue on.

My website is: [Marqaudio.com](https://Marqaudio.com)  


Take a look, and let me know if you have any ways to potentially help regarding this issue, or anything you may see otherwise!  

If you need any more information let me know!

Yes, as the title says, I want to learn Web Development as a way to earn my living. Not just see it as a merely job, but as a fun skill to learn and an activity to be fully committed.

I'm clearly a beginner, I've been learning the HTML basics watching YouTube videos and all that stuff, also I figured that basically a web developer needs to master: 

- CSS (and their ecosystems) 
- JAVASCRIPT programation language 
- JQUERY (framework for JS)
- PHP 
- MySQL and SQL, development skill using PHP and MySQL together 
- Laravel (PHP frameworks)
- back-end API Restful
- development platforms with JS NodeJS and MongoDB 
- additional technologies as SASE, LESS, BOOTSTRAP, SYMFONY, REACT and VUE and more development tools as Commands and GIT.

Knowing that the very first knowledge I must acquire and master is Html language, I would like to ask to the experimented redditors here, for any materials (books, web pages or documents with html charts tags and all that stuff) would be helpful for my skill development, in order to master html markup language first.

I first just wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone who commented on my last post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/HTML/comments/g79g9f/my\_html\_and\_css\_website/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HTML/comments/g79g9f/my_html_and_css_website/)) and gave such positive feedback because it really motivated me to work hard on creating a properly working version of my website for a mobile device. I am pleased to say that I have somewhat successfully created a mobile format for my website. Now it's not perfect I know that but it's much better than it was! There are still some issues with formatting like too many gaps between pictures and some pictures are appearing above the text and some appearing below but I will hopefully be able to fix them some point soon. I would love it if you could check it out and give me some feedback on the new format because I am always looking to add new features to my website (I'm thinking of adding a popup box that contains a fashion fact about whatever section the user is on next)! 

The way that I have laid my website out is by using columns, so some of the images are in the ""left\_middle\_column"" and some are in the ""right\_middle\_column"" this means that when I do a media query to make it suitable for mobile version the pictures are either above or below the text depending on if it was on the right or left column. Is there a way that I can easily change it so all of the pictures are displayed below the text because I think that would make the formatting of the mobile version much nicer.

The link to the website is  [https://www.fredsfashionboutique.com/](https://www.fredsfashionboutique.com/)  if you would like to check it out and give me some feedback!

 If i understand correctly id is used to define a style for one element and class is used to define a style for multiple elements.

And id is unique, meaning only one element can have a certain id.

But i decided to experiment using the same id to define multiple elements (instead of class) and it worked, even though id is considered to be used once by an element.

So, my question is: is this supposed to happen? Can i use the id element to define everything? I mean, yes it's a hassle to do it like that, but it seems to work.",1,html,2020-10-13

* when this is full screen it works perfectly. But when I start to reduce the size my green text box starts to come outside of my image.

I‚Äôm using bottom element to put the text box over the image. margin-top also works but still the same result when resizing the screen. See CSS code below:

g4pw8d,Dynamically auto-updating table based on directory content,"I am looking to design a webpage for personal use.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I begin stating what I need on the page, let me give a little info re the organisation of the website. It is running on IIS installed onto a home server running Windows Server 2016. In the root folder, I have a folder called 'images'. Alongside the 'images' folder, I would like to create a webpage. I have access to Dreamweaver (this is less preferable as it is via Citrix) and notepad. I have no coding experience. At. All.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, onto what I'm looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

The webpage needs to consist of a single table, 3xn. n being the number of rows, which will change dynamically depending on the pictures in the 'images' folder.

&amp;#x200B;

In column 1 I would like the picture to be displayed.

In column 2 I would like the filename of the picture to be displayed.

In column 3 I would like the URL of the picture to be displayed.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea being that as I add/remove pictures, the table will automatically add/remove the appropriate rows.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this possible? And if so, how?

Changing that second line to be more like:

removed the logo, which confuses me because:

g2bg6u,How to compare a text input,"Hey, i'm building my first website and i want the user to type in some sort of password (predefined by me), press a button and be redirected to another page according to the text he inputed. I.e. if the user enters ""start"" he will be redirected to the start page, if he enters ""my\_personal\_password"" he gets redirected to a page specificaly made for him, if he inputs something invalid, it displays ""invalid password"".

It does not have to be secure, (i'm not working with any sensible data, it's just so, that you cant just go anywhere where you should rather not be.). The main goal is to be simple.

I allready implemented the inputfield and the button but i don't know how to use them for my problem. Half a day of intense googeling did not help me, since I don't really know what to look for.

Can you help me?

Currently i'm working on a project for my college and we had to make a website for a specific course.  
The website is made with a website builder and allows customization through HTML.

Somehow, the website doesn't work whenever you enter the url just by itself; [https://example.com](https://example.com) won't work. It will show a blank page which cannot be changed. instead of this I need to add a slug for it to work, changing the site to [https://example.com/home](https://example.com/home) as a home page. however, people visiting or going to the website by entering the url directly will end up on a blank page.  


Is there a short HTML script to redirect the user to the right slug?

g0297u,Bootstrap Navbar Dropdown Not Aligning with Rest of Navbar Items,"Hello Reddit!

I am currently a rookie coder taking a course on HTML and I am having trouble with my Navbar that I got from Bootstrap. Specifically, my dropdown menu, called ""Locations"" will not align with the rest of the items on the Navbar. I am attaching a picture of the Navbar as well as the HTML code:

fzypze,Squarespace -- Vertical Align with Flexbox,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Relative beginner. I have a squarespace site I'm trying to vertical align a two column section.  Looks like the easiest option would be to use Flexbox in the Custom CSS section. Something like this (credit to u/bradrush):

&amp;#x200B;

display: flex;

flex-direction:row;

align-items: center;

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm having an issue targeting the parent div. I understand how to manipulate the children, with something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

\#block-yui-..... {

}

&amp;#x200B;

But can't figure out the code structure to target the parent. I tried the following, but doesn't seem to work:

&amp;#x200B;

\#page-section-5e922718088a700728e0bc98 {

	display: flex;

	flex-direction:row;

	align-items: center;

}

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback would be really appreciated!",1,html,2020-10-13
fzw36e,"class=""icon icon-view"", what does it mean ?","Hi,

So this website used to show how many views at the very bottom of each article. Up till June of last year they decided to take the ""views"" away because of the low count. 

I played a little in the HTML and I saw a couple of numbers next to  class=""icon icon-view"" : [https://imgur.com/a/2tVA6Fn](https://imgur.com/a/2tVA6Fn)

Is that the hidden traffic views or what exactly",5,html,2020-10-13

which gives me what I want but it takes the style.css from my text box as shown [here](http://prntscr.com/rxrznj). 

How do I go about having the go button work how it currently does but have it in line with the cancel button and not part of the input boxes div? I tried putting it into the cancel's div but it doesn't act the same.
