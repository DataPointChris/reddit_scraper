g8oghxq,ja9ph8,"A sites HTML is pretty much always visible. While it can be packaged up they cannot hide things from you that you can see. 

The og:image tag you are referencing is an html tag that’s used by Facebook. The image specified there will show up when you share the image on Facebook. Some sites may put the main image there while others may not. It’s all up to whoever coded the site. 

Here are two methods to get the image. Method 1 is quicker but I sometimes use method 2 if I need more stuff. 

Method 1: open the network tab and reload the Instagram page. That will show you all files loaded on that page. You can filter the files by type, so filter by images. Go through the list until you find the image. 

Method 2: if you want to get the source code of the image, I use inspect element and use the DOM selector thing (in the target kind of button in the top left of the inspector). I use that and click on the image on the page. Instagram is a bit sneaky where the image is not the element you will get when you do this. They put the image behind some other dom elements so regular users cannot down them. 

Starting with the item that got selected click the ‘h’ key on your keyboard. This will hide the element you’re on. If the image is still visible click ‘h’ again to reverse that and then move up 1 parent dom element and repeat the process. Eventually you’ll get to an element that when hidden will hide the image. When that happens you know the image is a child of that DOM element. Keep doing the hiding and revealing until you land on the element with the image. It may either be an img tag or a background tag.",4.0

It's possible you may find a fun use-case where you have tooltips that populate from the `cite` attribute.

&gt;As with `&lt;blockquote&gt;`, you can also add a `cite` attribute with a URL for the quotation’s source (subject to the above caveats against hidden data).

g7v1s4o,j5xh4j,"HTML is only a part of what you'll need to do what you're asking. You'll need CSS (to control the look and feel of your App), a database/data-store to store the appointments, an API that sits on a server to handle communication between your web-app and your database. And you'll more than likely JavaScript to add interativity to your web-app. The API will need to have authentication to control who can do what. Depending on your needs you'll need to work with timezones (which can be tough even for the experienced programmers).

The fact that you're asking this question in an HTML forum leads me to believe you have little to no programming knowledge.

I would recommend taking a web programming course first before you do anything else: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development) then you can move onto the more specific goal of creating  a scheduling app: [https://medium.com/@kris101/building-appointment-scheduler-app-in-react-and-nodejs-d01f7294a9fd](https://medium.com/@kris101/building-appointment-scheduler-app-in-react-and-nodejs-d01f7294a9fd)

I recommend Node over PHP for new programmers as Node uses the JavaScript language, so much of what you learn there can be very helpful when writing Javascript for your front-end app.

g7v6ejo,j5xh4j,"I'm sorry, I don't have any experience with `UltimateWB`. However, my general view on CMS' (and EComerce platforms) are that they can:

1. Be helpful for beginners (don't need to know whats under the hood)
2. Allow you to get up and running faster (someone else has done the thinking for you)
3. Free updates [usually] (you get bugfixes and new features!)

However, the downsides are that:
1. You generally don't learn anything about the system that it sits upon or how it works.
2. When things go wrong (as they tend to do), you won't know why because you didn't write the code (you can find out, you can debug, you can ask experts on the system, but it is much more difficult to fix a system you didn't build, than one you did).
3. The CMS will likely not perform as well as a custom built solution -- it will contain elements/features you will never use, or you have to extend it so much for your purposes it becomes a burden (restricive) rather than helpful anyway.
4. You need to learn the about the CMS anyway which is time you could be spending on learn generic web development skills.
5. Being an expert on this one particular CMS is less helpful to you in the longrun with regard to job prospects than investing in your general web development skills.

Having said that, purpose built is not always the way to go. My day job is programming, so if I were to start an online shop i'm more likely to go with something like Shopify to start with rather than write something myself because A) Shopify is specifically built for this purpose, B) I don't really have the time to spend creating an ECommerce app from the ground up (which includes setting up integrations with payment providers), I would look at writing something for myself if Shopify no longer suited my needs or the scale got to the point where it was cost effective for me to invest my time in doing so.

What I'm saying is you need to look at your project definitions:

* What am I trying to acheive? - what are my goals, what is my end goal?
* How long do I have? - when do I want to launch/go-live?
* What resources do I have? - money, people etc

These will all factor into your decision.

You can always iterate, start with the CMS and build your own custom solution later on.

Hope this helps.",2.0
g7vv6ns,j5xh4j,"Yes, you can create pure HTML websites that are dynamic — or almost anyway.

For someone with programming experience, it should extremely easy for you to understand how to do it.

The advantage is that it allows you to easily maintain a website without resorting to complex CMS solutions. But, I would probably still prefer a CMS for most thing.

You basically just need a PHP script that accepts the POST data from your HTML forms. Thinking about it, actually doing this in pure HTML is so easy it's interesting that it is not done more often in the wild. I see designers edit HTML/CSS all the time in their CMS, so they might as well just make certain pages in pure HTML..

Just be sure to use prepared statements if using a database like MySQL, and, of course, validate user input where it makes sense. I would not necessarily validate an e-mail address, since there are a lot of ""valid"" addresses that are not used in practice, and it is not very useful to validate everything. Ultimately, just trying to send an e-mail should be enough to validate e-mail addresses.

* There is no CSS [float: center](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp) property. read the float and clear doc linked, super helpful stuff there too.

* use properties only when you need them and remember the C stands for cascading. which means if you apply a 

*text-align:Center;* to the body, everything inherits that and you don't need to write it again.

The first error that occurs is because its trying to find a div called ""search-mobile-trigger"" that is missing in your version. It looks like there were various components included in the template that you've stripped out of yours for whatever reason, and they're causing the break.

That's my observation anyway.",1.0

g7fjmo0,j3y5mu,"P.S. The browser Console is a front end developer’s best friend. Anything executed on the client side is able to report out to the Console so even when a page appears to be rendering correctly for you, it’s always worth checking to see if anything unexpected is appearing there. Often it can help resolve potential issues that might be occurring for users on other browsers that you aren’t able to test on yourself, just because you’ll be able to see errors that aren’t consequential for you but could be in other instances.

Also, you can output directly to the Console using JavaScript when you’re writing your own code. The command console.log() is all you need. Here’s an example...

`console.log(“This js file is being executed”);`

That type of simple command is useful for basic debugging when something unexpected is happening and you need to narrow down where in your code the problem is coming from. Because JS is executed from top to bottom, a few of those lines can show you how far the browser got through your code before the problem occurred.

Also...

`let myKitten = “Fred”;
console.log(myKitten);`

You can output the contents of a variable to the console as per the example above too. Super useful when you want to see more of what’s going on during certain events in your code. Great for detecting broken if statements for example too.

Lastly, the Console in your browser also has full access to the JS interpreter and to the DOM of the page that’s open.

This means that you can enter JavaScript commands directly in the text input box at the bottom of the Console window and it will run live on the page.

That’s useful if you want to see what’s inside a variable after taking a certain action, for example. Or if you want to execute a function in your code and see its result live on the page.

The first time I discovered the Console I was blown away by how useful and versatile a tool for debugging it could be. If this is your first time working with it, give it a chance and make sure to keep checking what’s in there on future projects using JavaScript!!

Enjoy! :-)",1.0

g7azzns,j3cdd0,"So you're using `placeholder` incorrectly here - placeholder is meant to represent *example* data - so you'd want your placeholder to be `placeholder=""Gary""` or something.

Instead of using `aria-label` here, you should just use an actual `&lt;label&gt;` and place it on-top of the input, and move it out of the way when the input is active or has content.

`aria-label` is good for things that don't have a visible label - for example hamburger buttons and social links that only have icons.

If you're not familiar with how to move the label out of the way, [here's an example](https://codepen.io/pookagehayes/pen/ReJmEG) \- basically you just need to make use of the `:placeholder-shown` and `:focus` states - but you could also brute-force it by adding / removing classes if you prefer.",2.0

g7bcnd4,j3cdd0,"That's fair enough, but `placeholder=""First name""` is semantically incorrect HTML.  I'm afraid it's just wrong - remember that the role of HTML is to accurately describe its contents and that's not what you're doing here.

To directly quote [the HTML spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#element-attrdef-input-placeholder):

&gt;The placeholder attribute should not be used as a replacement for a &lt;label&gt;

If, for whatever reason, you absolutely cannot have a `&lt;label&gt;` element (which, I want to reiterate, is the correct thing to do in this case), then `aria-label=""First name.""` is correct, and you should remove the `placeholder` attribute entirely and instead use a `::before` or `::after` element with `content: ""First name""` so as to avoid actively making your HTML worse 👍",3.0

g7edxop,j3c196,"Just seems that if you’re going down a route as an alternative to C++, you will find that HTML isn’t really comparable in terms of functionality or power.

If you’re able to add some JavaScript into the mix, you’ll be able to demonstrate your comprehension of many of the same programming concepts that would be available on a C++ project. Even at the most basic level, for example, HTML doesn’t even have variables, loops, arrays, etc. It’s just a language used for marking up content on a page. JS would give you all that though.

If you had JavaScript, you could do more than offer a static web page. You can introduce interaction with the user.

For example, you could create something really simple like a digital dice roller for use on a tabletop board game, allowing the user to specify the number of sides the dice they want to roll has.

Or perhaps at a more intermediate level, you could create an interactive timeline to explore a historical event, letting the user zoom in and out between days/weeks/months/years/decades view. It could pull the data for the timeline from a database too.

Or if you want something more advanced, you could create a tool that doesn’t just let the user view or explore stuff, but let’s them input data for others to see too. For example, a reverse social media platform, where people don’t create a profile about themselves but instead write reviews of other people they know - friends, relatives, partners, their boss or their teachers!

Just some ideas anyway, just saying that without JavaScript it’s gonna be impossible to do anything except to present static content on a page for view in a web browser. You’ll need CSS to style that content too btw, but I’m assuming you’re able to use that as it’d be insane to do HTML without it.

g6vq7u5,j0whqb,"You'll need some sort of service/api for this, like twillio (https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api). You'll need you're own back end service to handle the requests and make the API calls to the third party service (like twillio). Your back-end service will need to be written in PHP, node (JavaScript), Java, C# (.NET) or some other server-side language/runtime

If you're already a little bit familiar with JavaScript then node might be the way to go as the syntax is mostly the same. If you're not familiar with any of these then node also might be the way to go as much of what you learn can be applied to front end/client-side JavaScript.

That alone is not possible because the information (i.e. the final URL of the IFRAME page) is only available within the content of the IFRAME. Since the IFRAME points to a different site, that means it's in a different domain.

g6p920w,j073tg,"Pretty much the only difference between your form and the FCC one is CSS. You'll just have to fiddle with that until it matches.  


If by not having a clue you mean not knowing what CSS to write, you're going to have to systematically google and/or guess how to do something e.g. how to stack radio buttons.

There are often many different ways of getting to the look you want. One of the big differences between your form and the FCC one is that theirs is smaller, and in the middle of the page.

One way you could achieve this is by moving the form inside a div, and then applying `margin: auto;`

[Example](https://codepen.io/razermoon/pen/yLOwqww) P.S. I stacked the buttons by moving the input inside the label.

&amp;#x200B;

Making your HTML look ""good"" or ""right"" doesn't have an obvious path, however finding websites that have the look you're going for and looking at their CSS is a good way of learning. I would also highly recommend you to look at [RefactoringUI](https://refactoringui.com/), it has a lot of great tips.",1.0

but to get you headed in the right direction, give your form a background color so you can see the difference of the form and the body.  The blue in your code is the body, so you need to make your form stick out like your example.

find a width for the form you find acceptable, and center it.

define the width/height of your inputs, its also nice to have hover affects so the user knows what input they are on, but your example doesn't have any.

g6na8e9,j00wru,"OK assuming you have a good grasp of HTML/CSS I would try using CSS grid for layouts.

https://repl.it/@DavidNguyen32/QuerulousTrustingProtocols

Things to note about my example:

1. It's written for desktop, if you want it to be responsive for mobile or smaller screens you will have to add media queries and make the rows larger (or) add more rows

2. I suggest you copy the code from REPL and open the files on from your desktop or whatever HTML editor you use.  If you widen the CSS page to look at the code in REPL you will make the display smaller and run into the issue I described in #1

3.  Another layout tool is Flexbox, but i just used that to align the content inside of the grid containers, if you would like to see that, send me a msg and ill add to the example.

4. There are different variations to writing CSS grid in case you see other examples that are written a little different, maybe you will prefer the other ways so look at other examples.

5. I could  have easily written the same thing with only 5 rows, I would just make each long enough to contain the content.  I just used 15 to show off how it works better (i hope).  Rows and columns do not have to have the same measurements.

if you have any questions lemme know. Hope this helps",2.0

g6fk2j9,iywx46,"In some scenarios it’s a toss up between margin and padding; either one would be ok. There are some scenarios though where one makes more sense than the other. 

- [Collapsing margins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing) are something to read up on. Basically, block level elements will “collapse” their margins. If you have 2 adjacent paragraphs with margin: 10px there will only be 10px between them, not 20px. If you use the web inspector you can see the margins overlap. With padding the spacing would be 20px between them. 
- If your element has a background color margin and padding will cause a big visual difference. Padding will be inside the background while margin will not. Typically I will use a mixture of margin and padding to get my desired result. 
- Very similar to the previous point is click areas. Say you have nav links. I typically like to give them some padding do their click area is larger than their text. Sometimes I will even give elements padding and then use negative padding to pull things in.

g5yi88m,ivz4ac,"Nice, some criticism though:  


* I think you should put the files into a GitHub repository instead of sharing them through Goggle Drive. There are several reasons for this, code maintainability etc.
* Your video is a *tutorial* so you don't need to write comments live, you can just explain what each part does as you're writing. You could put the comments there before you upload the files, incase somebody doesn't want to go back to the video.
* You used VSCode's side by side editing but after about six minutes, you focused entirely on the CSS for the rest of the video. Next time, you should minimize the HTML file.
* I'm not saying the viewer won't be able to see the code well, *but* the font is *pretty small* for a **tutorial**. If you're making a tutorial and explaining every part of the code, you should increase the font size. I don't see a point in having already explained code taking up 3/4 of the screen.
* The microphone quality is very bad, sometimes I can barely hear you over the noise. I'd recommend applying noise reduction to your audio or recording your voice using your phone instead. There is also a lot of pausing in the video, you should rehearse beforehand (see my lower point).
* Most of the mistakes above can be fixed by writing a script and rehearsing it first; you were pausing a lot in the video. This will cut down the video length significantly and will also make the video easier to understand.  
A lot of the popular coding tutorial channels write the code first, then write the script, then record themselves writing the code and talking at the same time, reviewing to see if anything can be improved, then possibly doing the last take and uploading it.  
I'm not saying you have to do all of the above, but putting some more thought into the video and maybe having a note with all the main points you want to make would be good.  


I don't want to discourage you from making more tutorials by having this many points, but I think that trying to improve on what I mentioned would improve the quality of the tutorials. I would personally enjoy the tutorial more.",1.0

[Event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#addEventListener_and_removeEventListener) are preferred over inline event handlers:

* Seperation of concerns -- it keeps your HTML and Script in discreet blocks (not so much a factor anymore with frameworks like React)
* You don't need to pollute the global scope with all the functions you use as event handlers.
* You can attach multiple event listeners, but only one inline event listener.
* Depending on how many events you are adding, inline events can bloat your markup.
* You can't configure your handlers to fire in the [\`capture\` phase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#Event_bubbling_and_capture) with inline event handlers. Understanding how bubble and capture work with regard to events can be VERY helpful.

Secondly, it is best to wrap your inputs (and other form elements (select, textarea etc) into a \`&lt;form&gt;\` element, change that button to a submit button, and listen to the submit event on the form, this way if the user presses enter in your input element your desired behaviour still occurs, it also helps screen readers.

I mean, either it's supposed to look like a button, in which case there's no harm in targeting the button tag, or it's not, in which case you should use a descriptive class name. So the `.button` class is either redundant or incorrect, at least until you add that some other element that's supposed to look like a button.

g5ai6g2,isq3b2,"When HTML was first implemented in the 90's, a lot of tags were introduced that styled the text a certain way - &lt;b&gt; for bold, &lt;i&gt; for italic, &lt;s&gt; for strikethrough, for example.

Later on, it became apparent that HTML in this way tried to accomplish two things at once: Define the document and the semantic roles the different parts of it played, as well as how the text should be rendered graphically. This was generally seen as a problem.

That led to the decision that HTML should only specify the semantic structures in a text: This is a document, this is a paragraph, this text describes what's in the paragraph, etc. The graphic rendering was taken care of by using CSS. This decision led to much cleaner and easier to read HTML documents.

Because a lot of old documents had already used many of the old HTML tags in a graphical manner, the producers of web browsers decided to keep the old way of interpreting HTML tags. Therefore, &lt;b&gt; still results in bold text.",1.0
g5b5ou2,isq3b2,"I think this mail correct, but in some instances I believe they've sort of retro-fit semantic meaning onto some elements (specifically `&lt;i&gt;`).",1.0
g5b5bq3,isq3b2,"`i` is used (I think) for generic italicized text, like book titles and such. `em` is for adding emphasis, like when you're attempting to convey some of the inflection of spoken word (""I am `&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;` sorry!"").

`&lt;b&gt;` and `&lt;strong&gt;` are different in a similar way, though off the top of my head I'm not sure of a grammatical rule that requires bold text.

I wasn't aware of the other ""duplicates"" you mentioned, but there's probably a semantic difference of some sort. Check MDN and/or the glossary (or whatever they call it) on css-tricks.com.

The most practical reason for semantic coding is accessibility, as special needs users are the ones most likely to notice a poorly coded website due to the ways in which they browse sites (and the tools they use to do so). Additionally, though, the more semantically sounds a website is, the easier it will be for somebody else to come in and interpret your code.",1.0

In your CSS, take your styles from `a span` and remove the lines from position down to width, then move the rest to just `a` styles.

g56i7kj,is6ign,"As long as your conventions and syntax are consistent and are what you prefer, then I have no issue with that.

But let's play devil's advocate, for constructive criticism's sake:

While you are using HTML5 standards (article, header, etc.) it doesn't seem entirely consistent. The first visible div (with an ID of ""main-content"" is just a &lt;div&gt;, however, HTML5 has a dedicated &lt;main&gt; tag for the main content. For consistency's sake (and to shameless further promote HTML5 semantic elements!) I would recommend using &lt;main&gt; and removing the id ""main-content.

While I understand why some of your tags are broken along class, id, content, etc. attributes, I think it's pretty bad practice and, while it might be easier to read and edit, might come off as a bit messy in the long run. Despite it not being a very beautiful fix, I would try just condensing the tags to one line. Alternatively, you could try and condense your classes/id's/data-attributes using semantic elements or more encompassing classes.

I don't have a full picture of the markup, but looking at the full view on the right of the screenshot makes me believe there is a dedicated header up a few dozen lines. If that is the case, then why do you have a &lt;header&gt; tag in your main content? &lt;header&gt; tags are designed for use once at the top of the page for your landing, or for your navigation bar. From Mozilla's amazing documentation on HTML semantic elements:
&gt; The HTML &lt;header&gt; element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

Given this (generally) standard definition for the &lt;header&gt; tag, why is it in this snippet of markup, inside the main content? 

Also, just to end this off, what is your top line of HTML? It looks awfully wrong, but that might just be the preview on the right cutting off the top. Make sure to use &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; at the very top so browsers know you are typing HTML5 and nothing else.

Otherwise, nice markup. As long as you are consistent, and understand the semantics and syntax of HTML5, you can't really go too wrong. Happy development!",1.0

g4x91qs,ir5wqf,"I thought I'd offer my perspective as someone who's worked as a front-end developer for a couple years, though u/SilentDis provided a great explanation.

Forms are probably the hardest part of learning HTML. In terms of figuring out how to submit a form, HTML will only go so far as to send the data, a back-end technology would have to go from there - so don't worry about what's happening in the back-end yet as such.

MDN is a popular resource for web developers, and provides a lot of good explanations as to how different elements of the web function. In relation to forms, [check this out](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data).

Things that may be good to know are the differences between HTML4 and HTML5 and all of the new semantic elements and media elements that have been introduced including &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt; etc. They not only help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO - helping your site to show up on search engines), but help with accessibility (A11y) too which refers to the movement in the web to make it accessible to people with impairments.

Good documentation for accessibility can be found in the [Google Developer Docs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility).

A good extension to check for accessibility issues is [Site Improve](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc) (I use Chrome so not sure about other browsers).

A list of all elements, including the new ones can be found on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). You don't need to know everything all at once, so I'd advise learning about the elements I mentioned above and creating a basic HTML page layout using those elements.

HTML is made up of all of the elements, though you'll often need to know about different attributes as well. I'm sure you're already familiar with classes and IDs, but it is good to have at least a vague awareness of all of the different types of attributes as well. the role attribute for example, is what most elements used for accessibility before semantic elements (MDN has an overview on WAI-ARIA roles [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)). You'll often see attributes beginning with 'data-' too, these are normally used for JavaScript for a multitude of reasons - [see here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes).

HTML and CSS, in a professional web development setup, are generally kept separate, but it is important to understand how CSS may inform the structure of your page. It's also important to understand Flexbox ([Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) is the best resource I've found), CSS Grid ([css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)'s explanation is great, css-tricks is also a fantastic resource for learning CSS in general).

In addition to Flexbox and CSS grid, it's also important to realise that sometimes they're overkill. They're also not supported on some older browsers so if you need to support IE 10 down you won't be able to use them (people argue this point with me a lot but sometimes older browser support is not up to you so you need to know how to work without them).

If you want two elements side by side for example, you don't have to use Flexbox or Grid, you can just set the display property of the two elements to 'inline-block' and set their widths to 50% (a little gotcha is that you'll have to make sure there's no whitespace between the two elements. Not sure why, just how browsers have always rendered it). If you want them to be vertically centered, just set their vertical-align property to middle. Vertical align will only work on table cells or element with display: inline-block set.

Old webpages also used tables, which is worth knowing about if you end up building a page that needs to work on browsers that don't support Flexbox or Grid, though they're not entirely necessary as you can do most of it with the display, height, width, line-height, text-align and vertical-align properties.

I think the thing people struggle with most in CSS is centering - both horizontally and vertically. Again, check out [this article](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) on CSS-Tricks.

Those are just some basic examples to give you a bit of direction but again, as u/SilentDis said, we can't remember everything and day-to-day I'm Googling all the times refreshing myself on everything. What you want to have is an understanding of what's used where and what to look for, but knowing exact syntax, keywords etc. is impossible for everything.

g4whyvn,ir5wqf,"Heya! I do web dev and server admin for a living (at least, in part).

I memorize nothing. I mean nothing. I know syntax, and basic elements of course, I know how the DOM layers work, and I understand how CSS works. I even know how SVG works. But, I don't know every tag, option, or setting.

I cannot tell you, right now, how I'd implement a pull down menu. Not even joking. I can't tell you how I'd format flexboxes, or reactive buttons, or fades, or anything. None of it. NONE. Instead, I have a code repository of unstyled, templated, generic versions of each of these that I go through and refine every 2 months or so. That repository is my 'knowledge'. it's functional, fast, and accurate.

This lets me focus on UI/UX style. I can draw a mock-up and then work on bringing it to life later. I just have 2 screens full of my repository, css-tricks, mozilla's html5 guide, etc. up all at the same time when I'm writing a site.

Once you have the basics of HTML5 and CSS down, learn how PHP and MariaDB/MySQL work. Again, you don't need to know 'everything' - you need to know the format, syntax, etc. Then, get good resources that you understand, and have them up.

Next up: WordPress. Learn how it work. I know, I know - it's supposed to be 'stupid simple'. The reason you do it in this way, is so you can dive into the various templates and customize them for your client, or write your own that you can then sell. I have a couple; the only way to get them is to hire me. Most design houses do this. Even without your own templates, being able to dive in and write some custom stuff for a client makes you valuable.

Finally, learn to pull a WordPress server up from 'go'. As in, start with a base VPS on Debian or Red Hat, and learn how to pull it all the way up from that 'zero state' to a functional WordPress server with proper SSL (even just Let's Encrypt). This morphs you from a 'just a web dev' to 'server admin'. It's an extra month or so of farting around on your own - while you're already working as a web dev - to learn, and makes you able to charge more money. More money is good :D

I know 'more' than this. Lots of it comes from experience though, learning weird stuff for clients here and there (for example, Java, JavaScript, node.js, Sass, FontAwesome, etc.), then using that knowledge for the next and the next client. That's the nature of the work, though - you never stop learning, and you are replacing your old knowledge and methodology every 6 months to a year. If you stagnate, you sink.

My going rates tend to be around $50/hr for a full pull-up, $25/hr for 'general maintenance', and $35/hr for overhauls. My prices are incredibly low; but I have a steady job that I'm paid hourly for that takes care of my health insurance and such. If I was doing full-on only contract work from a self-employed standpoint, my prices would be double or triple. Instead, I'm super picky about what I want to work on, and usually only have 2 clients at a time, and I focus on causes I care about, or small businesses near me. I have that freedom to be picky :)",4.0
g4wnwvq,ir5wqf,"Thank you so much for your insight and the thought, and detail you put into it. Seriously this really helps see things better. One of my most difficult things to understand right now is how to put things into divs, classes, or boxes and position them on the site to create a better layout. I was able to figure out how to create a simple nav bar and search bar, but I'm having a hard time with layout.",2.0
g4wpnf9,ir5wqf,"The best answer I have for that is to draw it!

Yes, piece of paper and pencil, and draw your page. Crude boxes with a general 'look' you want. I do this with clients all the time; giving them a basic, initial concept they agree with. Nav on the left, or right, or top, where spaces are... wavy lines for 'text'. Couple little hand drawn symbols here and there, etc. Very very basic stuff.

That helps dictate your `&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` sets. Generally speaking, pretty page title - nav - data - footer bar. Each is in its own `&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`. Now, you may have more `&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` inside that (like, each blog entry, or each paragraph section, etc.), but from a styling perspective, having those 'top level divs' makes your life so much easier.

This is, admittedly minor, a good time to decide on your schema stuff too. No, you probably won't actually activate schema (that's how Google reads pages and pull-quotes, allows for better indexed searching, etc.), but you'll be setup for it, and you'll have just generally good structure in the first place. That means you're using headers down to about 3, you're not using more than 1 `&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;`, you're using `&lt;thead&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;`, `&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;`, and `&lt;tfoot&gt;&lt;/tfoot&gt;` in tables (if you're using tables at all), and other such stuff. This makes your page searchable by Google in the first place, so people can find whatever it is you put out there. And, without good structure, there is a valid argument stating that your page doesn't exist if Google can't index it well.

All of that is easier if you draw it first. :)",2.0

Plus, you can swap the entire look and feel of the whole site with a few clicks into new templates, and the content has to be able to flow into *any* template WordPress has.

No, it's not 'good form'. It's easy development. It's active development. It sucks. Deal with it. ;)",1.0

g4wqfi2,ir5wqf,"Quick extra reply, because this is important, and I do it... but even I just overlooked it while telling you all this:

Accessibility.

I pride myself on having accessible pages. As in, blind people can fully access and use the sites I build. It's an extra hour or so of coding to do, and a little extra forethought and planning, plus maybe another 30 minutes of testing, but it is absolutely crucial.

Do not leave people out from using your site because you are lazy or don't think about it. That's just as bad as discrimination in my book, and knowing how little extra it takes me to make a page fully accessible for those who have vision problems, I look down on sites that don't think about it.

This means your page is a bit 'simpler' and doesn't do all the crazy stuff you know how to do. That's... a good thing, in my opinion. Simpler is easier on the user in the first place. Plus, it focuses you; sure, you may use a whiz-bang pretty transition, but you're only using 1, not 8. :)

The easiest way I can recommend to do this is to open your page in [Links](http://links.twibright.com/), or some other text-only browser. Think of someone using a braille terminal (yes, they're still around) and getting a single line of text speeding along to their fingers that they're reading. Or, a monotone voice speaking at 3x normal speed, reading out exactly what you're seeing in Links. Does it make sense? Can you navigate still? Can you get data off the site, or otherwise figure out what is going on?

If not, back to the drawing board! :)",2.0

g4vbw02,iqzwhd,"Thats a lot of code, but i saw something that was odd in ur coding

When setting a class attribute of an html element, its usually set as  =

`&lt;div class=""class1name class2name""&gt;`

However you are coding these as 

 `&lt;th class = "".bg1"" "".center""&gt;Home&lt;/th&gt;` 

The `.classname` syntax is used when styling css, not within html class attribute. In your css you have already declared 

`.bg1 {`

To use either you will need to install Node.js, and as such npm or similar. Setting this up is free and can be easily done with an installer from the official site. Further installing your desired framework works via console commands.

To note is that browserify's fs, which you need to install in addition, works async only, while electron supports both sync and async filesystem usage.

But for the sake of organization, I highly recommend a Udemy course.(Or whatever platform for learning you prefer..I personally prefer Udemy) Make sure the course has projects. 

{Sidenote: html alone has very few uses. If you are trying to build a website or a webapp or pursue full stack Development, then you will need HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and then ideally a development framework...but don't worry about frameworks for now. You can build really cool stuff with just html and css...but for more professional projects as a no longer beginner, a framework is what most people use. This sidenote is important because if you do in fact want to learn HTML for building websites/webapps, then I recommend finding an all inclusive course}

Do the course and follow along by building the projects alongside the course's presenter.

Once you understand the basics, build a project for yourself for fun. Try to figure out how to give it cool new features that you aren't certain of how you might build. Google for answers! Copy and paste code if needed.

You learn by building and pushing the limits of your own building capabilities. No project is too simple when you're a beginner. Just keep going and you will get better and better pretty quickly.

g4m6hrs,ipucsf,"Heya! CSS makes it super easy to apply different styles to different elements :) but first we should address a few problems with the code you shared. 

1.	I don’t think that `&lt;! RealTimeClock&gt;` tag is valid... I _think_ you meant to add it as a comment, in which case it should look like this `&lt;!-- RealTimeClock --&gt;`
2.	You can’t have two bodies. Your entire page should be wrapped in a single top-level `&lt;body&gt;` tag. 
3.	Additionally, semantics says that pages should only have one `&lt;h1&gt;` element. H1 literally means “Heading level one” and is used as the main heading for your entire page. Better semantics would be to use multiple `&lt;h2&gt;` tags for each section.

You didn’t share your CSS files but I’m guessing you’re styling them using a direct element selector like this

    h1 {
      font-size: value;
      color: value;
      // etc...
    }

CSS allows you to style elements using classes which allow you to write reusable styles and apply them to elements on your page! Classes can be named anything you’d like so long as they follow the proper format. You can write classes like this

    h2 {
      font-size: 4rem;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    .red-heading {
      color: red;
    }
    .blue-heading {
      color: blue;
    }

and apply them to your elements with the class attribute. Each one will inherit the styles from it’s own class, and they’ll both inherit styles from the `h2` selector. You can style elements directly, with classes and more!

    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h2 class=“red-heading”&gt;This one is red&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h2 class=“blue-heading”&gt;This one is blue&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

g4m7q5z,ipucsf,"Both answers given are correct, I'm just gonna explain your options a bit, based on the code you've given. Deeper understanding and all that :)

It sometimes helps to break out just the HTML in question, and put it indented. This way, you can find where in the structure of your page your elements are:

    &lt;body onload=""realtimeClock()""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""main-container""&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;REAL TIME CLOCK&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;div id=""rtclock""&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;img class=""img-background"" src=""image/image.jpg""&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;body onload=""showtimeClock()""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""STC-container""&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Show Time Clock&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;div id=""stclock""&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;

This helps reveal a lot about your code. Namely, you have 2 `&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;` elements which is odd, and only 1 of them is closed. On top of that, you have multiple IDed `&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` containers that simply open and close - I assume going with the .js you're using.

What it does show me, is where in the layers your `&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;` elements are, so you can call them out in a .css file or the like.

    .main-container h1 {}

This will directly call to that first &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;, and allow you to style it.

    .STC-container h1 {}

This will hit the second one.

You can do a combination of things; for example, if you want to make both of them 44pt font and italic, but the first one red, and the second one blue...

    h1 {
        font-size: 44pt;
        font-style: italic;
        color: red;
    }
    .STC-container h1 {
        color: blue;
    }

It's *cascading*. All `&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;` objects get that first, over-arching call all the time... but the second one is super specific, calling only to the one in the container with a class of `STC-container`.",3.0

g4j2tak,ipbvdb,"Ditch Dreamweaver, that's your first problem. Second, you need to know PHP to be able to do development on WordPress sites since this is the underlying language that it uses. HTML and CSS are static languages, they don't do anything, PHP is what adds the functionality.

So first step is to learn some PHP, you don't need to be a pro at it but you need a good basic understanding of programming. Then you need to get used to reading the WordPress developer docs for creating themes.",17.0
g4kzxyj,ipbvdb,I’ll pass. Wordpress can suck it,2.0
g4log2y,ipbvdb,"Respectfully, this is the wrong approach and attitude.  In the early heydey of the internet, people wrote pages with just HTML and CSS and ran into all sorts of problems with maintainability.  Frameworks like WordPress were invented to help alleviate these problems, and you ignore them at your own peril.

For a practical example, let's say that down the road your company gets a new logo.  With a static site, you have to go through the footer and change it on every page.  Sounds easy, but it's annoying because it applies to any change you want to make.

In fact, you're likely to run into this when designing your header and footer.  Maybe you look at it and decide you want to tweak something.  ok, do it 5 times.  Another tweak? 5 more times.

Another example: let's say you've got a list of things, say it's a restaurant and every dish has a description and a name and they're in a div.  With a static site for a restaurant with 20 menu items, that's at least 80 lines of code right there.  Any time you want to make a change, or add something somewhere, you have to go through all this nonsense to find it, adjust it, and hope you don't break anything. 

With a PHP or a JS framework, it's just a few lines of code, akin to something like

    $dishes = getDishes();
    foreach($dishes as $dish) :
        &lt;div&gt;
             &lt;h2&gt;$dish-&gt;title&lt;h2&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;$dish-&gt;description&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div
    end foreach;
        
That's it.  Then on the back end you have an area where you can add/remove/change dishes using an easy to use interface rather than having to code anything.

Now, I do understand that you're not trying to be a coder and so you're not interested in learning to code. That's totally legit.  However, let me tell you as a developer who started off building a website for his family's restaurant in the 90s: you're going to have a shitty time maintaining HTML and CSS unless it's a SUPER simple site.  I.e. just a landing page with some contact info.

CSS may seem easy now but it's more complex. Not mindfully difficult but more complex than the easy basics.


WordPress is difficult because WordPress is programming. Neither html or css are programming, in that you're not writing instructions, but rather you're writing descriptions. 

While it's definitely possible to learn WordPress before learning PHP, if you want to be a programmer, you should start with the language not the framework.

g4gcigl,iovxt6,right it runs on the browser but why do i get syntax error when i run using node?,1.0
g4gh2wa,iovxt6,"The issue is you're telling node to try and run an html file. Node needs you to point to a javascript file. Is your intention to just start a server that serves your html page? If so you can [follow the instructions on this page](https://flaviocopes.com/node-serve-html-page).

Basdically your file structure will be:

    - YourSite
        - app.js
        - index.html

`app.js` will contain the code in that article while `index.html` will contain your html.

Then in terminal run these commands inside your `YourSite` directory:

```
npm install http
npm install fs
node app.js
```

Then in your browser navigate to `localhost:3000` and you should see your web page.

One question though, where are you running the `aditya.php` page? Your javascript in your html points to this. You'll need a php server to have that page work. If you're using a PHP server then you probably want to have everything running in PHP and not a mixture of node and PHP.

Instead of having to update all your HTML, you just add a new file to the `posts/` directory and the site will be rebuilt automatically. If you're not using Github, you can run a command manually to generate the HTML after adding a post, then upload to whatever host you're using.

g40zw6k,ime7av,"That's how it was at the beginning and you still read this advice in text books, but standard practice these days is to *mostly* avoid using IDs for styling.  There's nothing wrong with adding another class to target, even if only one element will get it.

One of the major benefits of this is that you don't then have to deal with id-class hierarchy.  That is, you don't have to try and mitigate the precedence of ID selectors, which override classes, and instead can assume that all targeting is equal, and that the last/most specific rule will take precedence.

Also, I'm not sure if you were being literal with ""new"", but definitely don't ever just give something a vague id like new.  Both ids and classes should be much more descriptive.",4.0

g3wl1c4,ilsr7h,"If you're learning XHTML alongside HTML, I'm assuming you're using HTML4.

The big differences between those are DTDs (doctype definitions), closing tags, proper nesting of elements, case-sensitive tags, quoting attribute values, and avoiding attribute minimization.

w3schools, as you've mentioned you've checked out, should still have a resources for the DTDs. Honestly, unless you need to know them for a test or something, I'd just save them in a .txt file on the desktop for easy access when you need to copy/paste them in a document. They're lengthy and in a real-world application you should be using HTML5, which has a much easier to remember DTD.

In XHTML, every tag must be closed, including empty tags (such as `&lt;br&gt;` and `&lt;hr&gt;`), and properly nested in XHTML. Properly nested means if you open a tag inside another tag, it must be closed before the parent tag is closed. For example, `&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`. You can close empty tags like `&lt;br /&gt;` or `&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;`. Every tag must also be lowercase.

XHTML doesn't allow minimized attributes like `&lt;input type=""checkbox"" checked&gt;`, but instead uses fully written out attribute-value pairs like `&lt;input type=""checkbox"" checked=""checked""&gt;`.  Just in case you're unclear, the element is the word immediately following the &lt;, the attribute is the word immediately before the =, and the value is the word(s) in quotation marks. Values must always be in quotation marks in XHTML.

If your HTML already follows these rules, you should be able to just switch the DTD and have valid XHTML. You can also use [this tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload) to help make sure everything is right.

Hope this helps! If anybody has more to add, please feel free to chime in.",1.0

Basically you need to setup WordPress and create a custom theme with your styles.  You can setup what you've done so far as ""pages"" and then blog posts would be ""posts"".  You'd have a post template for the blog posts and then a page (or more if there are multiple pages with different layouts) template for your page. You should be able to figure it out with a WordPress tutorial but chances are you're going to have to spend some time learning this.

For the record though, the idea of a straight HTML/CSS site is virtually unheard of in this day and age.  Almost any site is going to use either a back end or front end (or both) framework like Symfony, Wordpress, React, Vue, etc.  So if you're planning on going into webdev, this is the kind of stuff you need to be learning.",3.0
g3jcgrk,ijz4mz,"I have been looking for this. I'm trying to learn by being self taught and this is something I just didn't understand how would the user work on the site after I made it for them. I thought possibly you would have to build and editor yourself and supply it to the user. I also knew about WordPress but, assumed a good web developer didn't use things like WordPress because how useful is it for someone to pay you to make a website if you are going to use WordPress too?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a similar position as OP. I can make a static website, I can add basic JavaScript to the website. Should someone at our level move toward back-end stuff after JavaScript like Node.js/php or start to get better things like Wordpress.

Goal being web developer and websites on the side.",2.0
g3julfe,ijz4mz,"&gt;assumed a good web developer didn't use things like WordPress because how useful is it for someone to pay you to make a website if you are going to use WordPress too?

Wordpress is a tool, sometimes it's the right one and sometimes not.  For blogs it's a no brainer.  But even for small business websites it's very useful.  It's also used by tons of news organizations.  E.g. I think Bloomberg is Wordpress.

The reason you'd pay for WP development is that you want a custom theme or custom functionality.  If you're just using some pre-made theme then you don't need a dev.  

Even if you're not using Wordpress, however, chances are that you'll be using *some* framework.  It's pretty rare that you'll code an entire website from scratch.  As they say, don't reinvent the wheel.  

&gt;Should someone at our level move toward back-end stuff after JavaScript like Node.js/php or start to get better things like Wordpress.

These aren't mutually exclusive.  Wordpress is a content management system written in PHP, and Wordpress development is PHP development.

The road to being a web developer generally requires that you learn HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL/JS as a base, and then you learn the tools.  Some people co-mingle their learning and so will e.g. learn Vue while learning JS, or WordPress while learning PHP.  Personally I think it's better to focus on programming basics before learning to use the frameworks, but ultimately it doesn't matter.  It's a long path and which ever direction you take you'll get there eventually as long as you just keep working at it.

Here's a roadmap that's sure to overwhelm you, but don't let it.  It takes years to get through it (I'm not through it yet even): https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap",2.0
g3o8vhv,ijz4mz,"Thanks for the detailed explanation and road map.
If I were building a blog/web-page for a portfolio should I do that from scratch or use something like wordpress? I ask because I started one using bootstrap. I followed the design from a free source but I am coding everything from scratch. Am I doing too much?",1.0
g3oa74u,ijz4mz,"No, that's awesome. I learned PHP by doing a Lynda tutorial where you end up building a content management system, and that's the tutorial where things started to click for me.

If you build a CMS it will be shit, and I promise you it's going to be tough, but that's not the point. It's much more impressive from a programming perspective if you can say you've done that than if you can say you've built a WordPress site, and you'll learn way more about programming in the process.

However, WordPress can be a lucrative skillset, so it's also worth learning. Being a great programmer and being great with various tools and frameworks is a winning combo.

Be forewarned, this project may be bigger than you think it is.  If you find yourself stuck don't be afraid to walk away for a while, get some practice and rethink it",1.0

Since you're using Django, you're using Python. If you are using a programming language, you are using it to build up the HTML dynamically (the opposite of static).

So you are correct: it's not a static site :)

This does mean the problem shifts from an HTML problem to a Django problem.

----

put this next line in your settings.py:

    STATIC_URL = '/media/'

Then add this line *once* to your template file (probably somewhere at the top):

    {% load static %}

Each plugin only support a number of specific media types.

If not embedded directly, it will require a Flash based video player. i.e. what's directly embedded is a Flash based program where that program is a video player. This too will require that the browser supports plugin system, and has the Flash plugin. Which media types are supported depends on the Flash based video player program itself. Not the Flash plugin.

The third and least used alternative is like previous one, except that it's a Java based video player, instead of Flash based. This will require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) plugin. Supported media types also depends on the video player program, instead of the Java plugin.

Keep in mind though, all of these will only work for older web browsers, since although the current web browsers still support browser plugin system, that browser plugin system is a new one which is incompatible with the old one; and so far, there is no plugin for supporting video/audio media.",1.0

If you are wanting the same styling on each page, I'd make a base template page, then copy that and rename the new copies to whatever your other links will be.

Also please notice that your tags are in the incorrect order, jsfiddle has marked them in red for you.

Edit: I read your comment to another user and it looks like you’re trying to make your table full width. Set it’s width to 100% with CSS and it should give you the width you’re looking for:

2. I added some extra long texts in these examples so you can see the columns run over this time

3. It doesn't really matter that text did not run over in the first example I gave because the point I was making is I wanted a wider table.  It should not matter if the space is needed to accommodate the text or not.

4. It is hard to tell how the actual web page looks on your end using this Fiddle thing because it is not a real whole web page like I can I see when I publish the web site from my web host.  Fiddle just has little boxes where is hard to gauge margins

5. I tried your suggestion above of 

 

    &lt;style&gt;   table {     width: 100%;   } &lt;/style&gt;

Thanks to my adhd i missed this. My resize issue is fixed, what i did was in the style body of the background add this

body {

background-image: url(""plane.jpg""); (location of picture)

background-repeat: no-repeat; (only 1 picture)

g2ubmrv,igj3bd,"Yeah, thats ""probably"" cos the image u are using might be smaller than the display size, so its ""tiling"" to fill the background?

There are multiple ways to set backgrounds tbh - 
I usually use CSS and set the elements styling to 
background-size: cover;
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp 
This can however cause some distortion of the image.

The key to ""Responsive Web Design"" is to make sure All elements scale based on display size. So if ur device changes, ur wrapper sizes should change too. and to account for that, a lot of element sizes are set in % units rather than fixed px units.

lol i wish i could explain it better",2.0
g2uzi0h,igj3bd,"Change `background-size: 100%;` to `background-size: cover;`

This will scale the image up proportionally to fill the screen. If your image is a different aspect ratio than the screen, it will be cropped, so you may also need to adjust the `background-position`, which is a powerful attribute that lets you control how the image is positioned. It accepts a wide variety of values, but my favorites are the keywords like center, top, left right, and bottom. You can actually set two values, one for vertical positioning and one for horizontal, like so:

`background-position: top left;`

Google the other options and play around to see what gets you the look you want.

Another common value for `background-size` is `contain`. Contain tells the image to be as big as possible without cropping, so it will grow to be either as tall or wide as the screen, but won't extend beyond the screen to fill all the white space like `cover` does.",2.0

g1zazel,ibzrjt,"Few questions:

- Regarding checking the console in different browsers, you checked the network tab as well? What does the network tab say for the status of the css file? If it's loading correctly in the network tab then your html meta tag is correct.

-Do you have a URL where this is running? The jsfiddle doesn't tell me much since it doesn't have a folder structure.

One thing I am thinking is that your paths are relative. For example, your CSS files path is `css/style.css`. When your on `https://yoursite.com` it will look at `https://yoursite.com/css/style.css`. Problems arise when you are at say `https://yoursite.com/about`. When on this page now it will look for css in ``https://yoursite.com/about/css/style.css`. Could this potentially be the issue?",4.0

```
&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com"" style=""color: blue; font-size: 2px; text-align: right;""&gt;Click on this&lt;/a&gt;
```

A couple of your CSS styles were incorrect. CSS style properties never have spaces in them and do not use quotes. `font-size` is for font size. You were also missing a unit for font size. `2` doesn't mean anything to CSS. `2px` would get you a `2px` font size. This is extremely small, so not sure if that's what you want? Text alignment is done with `text-align`. I removed the `p` tag. While you can technically put a `p` in an `a` it seems a bit weird. Usually your `a` would live inside the `p`. Also, `p` usually has some default styles from the browser so I removed it for the sake of this example.

One last note, you are using inline styles which are not best practice. Best practice would be to target the element you want in css and add the styles that way. You could either target all `a` elements or add a class name to the `a` like so:

html file

```
&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com"" class=""blue-link""&gt;Click on this&lt;/a&gt;
```

css files

```
.blue-link {
    color: blue;

Re: the first row, I'm on my phone, but try replicating that rule below where you've just added it, and change the selector to table tr:nth-of-type(1)

g1x7as9,i97xqu,I think I need use a class or ID like you suggest because I am adding other code in other sections on page....can u post example on how that is done,1.0
g1xaeva,i97xqu,"At the start of your code for the table, there is a &lt;table&gt; tag. Add the attribute id=""table1"" to that, so it would look like &lt;table id=""table1""&gt; - you may have some other bits there, so just fit the ID bit in around that. The order isn't particularly important in this case.

Then in your CSS, instead of just all tables, you would reference the ID, so this:

`table tr:nth-of-type(odd) {`

Would become 

`#table1 tr:nth-of-type(odd) {`

(Note the hash - that denotes an id attribute in your html code)

If you wanted to use a class, you would obviously change the attribute in your table tag from id to class, but reference it in your css with a dot rather than a hash like this:

`&lt;table class=""table1""&gt;`

`.table1 tr:nth-of-type(odd) {`

Basically both will do the same thing - it adds a selector so you can pick your element out using CSS or JavaScript, the main difference being that an id should only be used once per page, whereas a class can be used multiple times. You can also add multiple classes to each element if you wanted to, so you could do this:

&lt;table class=""red-background big-font""&gt;

And then both of those classes would be applied to the same table.

Another thing you will probably want to note is something called CSS specifity, which basically means that these rules are applied in an order of importance, namely:

1) Inline styles (like you had originally within your html code)

2) Whole element selectors (as we've already used to style table tr) with no class or id present

3) IDs

4) Classes

This is why we needed to use !important on our previous code - there were already inline styles that we were having to override. Here is an example of CSS specifity in action that I put together a little while ago for somebody else on here - https://codepen.io/guerresinge/pen/gvqjrz?editors=1100

Some other layout types:

Paragraphs `&lt;p&gt;` uses `display: block` and will try to take up as much width as possible.

Span `&lt;span&gt;` uses `display: inline` and will try to take up as little as space as possible.

Tables `&lt;table&gt;` are using a `display: table` layout and will use as much space as they need (overriding a lot of other rules if those are in the way)

`display: flex` isn't used as default by an element, but it is available when people want to display items in either a `row`, `row-reverse`, `column` or `column-reverse`. The default value is `row`.

There are many more options for display (`display: grid` is another popular option), but these are the most familiar ones.

I've learned this by reading the CSS Specification.

You should know the CSS spec is divided into ""CSS 2.1"" + a whole bunch of ""level 3"" (and ""level 4"", though you can replace 'level' with 'version') that either override or add onto CSS 2.1.

[CSS snapshop 2018](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2018/#css) is the current stable version (no level 4, because that's still very early stuff). Pick a chapter (like ""selectors level 3"" or ""values and units level 3"", for example) and just start reading.

Don't like reading? Use a [text to speech extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/natural-reader-text-to-sp/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk) to read it for you (or read along - that's what I did). Just make sure you picka free voice, not a premium one, because the premium voice will stop working after a bit and you'll be used to that voice and be disappointed you can't use it anymore.

g14jp37,i7w71g,"&gt; I tried using this example but it doesn't seem to work.

That example works. If you've blocked/disabled JS, the burger menu won't work. Clicking it won't do anything. However, for that example, the JS is only needed for handling the click event on the burger menu. The CSS already handles the switching between column and row based menu. It's just that in that example, the row based view mode is hidden by default and can only be shown/hidden by clicking the burger menu.

The dot character is one of CSS special characters. A dot is for specifying a class name (the element's `class attribute contains space-separated list of class names). A colon is for specifying pseudo class (predefined class names).

The page you are currently on is https://www.example.com/foo. You are sending out emails that include a link to this page and you want to show users content that is half way down the page when they click the link you sent them. 

What you do is you reference an element in the section you want uses to see when the page loads, such as: 

&lt;div id=“blogs”&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Then, when you’re creating links to that page you reference that element. So the link you would send to your users would be https://www.example.com/foo#blogs

You’re referencing a specific element by its ID in the url, which automatically puts that element in the users view on page load.

g0ww0fh,i6n6zw,"To extend upon this answer, whether JS will work for you (OP) depends on what precisely are you trying to do.


Is the information saving only for users, in that the server doesn't need to save anything? Then Javascript is good enough.
For example, an app that generates HTML calendars based on input birthdays. The server doesn't need to remember anything, it just spits out calendars and forgets immediately.


If your app requires the server to hold onto information, then you need some server-side processing, and a database. 
For example, if I need my app to automatically send an email to me to remind me of upcoming birthdays, JS is not enough.


In the OP, you asked how to accept information from users... I recommend looking at HTML forms and how POST/GET works. You can have someone text you a date of birth, but it is significantly more complicated. Look at products like Twilio if you want to go the text route.


Anyways, the general rule of thumb is that HTML is only structure. CSS is only shape and look. If you need to do something based on some logic, you need a programming language to suppliment your HTML/CSS.

Javascript runs on your visitor's browser and is (usually) enough if whatever you are trying to do happens entirely during a single session... If you don't need to delay until later, if you don't need to remember anything, JS will work.

If you need something more complex, where you need to remember something, or you have tons of little steps to complete, or you need to delay until later, then you need a server side language (Ruby, PHP, Python).",1.0

g0xm1c5,i6n6zw,"You as the owner of the site, will need to save the data in your web server. This needs to be done using server-side scripts (e.g. PHP). Data is commonly saved into a database record (in the server) where each record contains e.g. order ID or shopping cart ID, time of order, list of items, etc.

If you use a web hosting site to host your website, they may provide an optional module for this specific purpose, or at least, related to it (check their documentation). Otherwise, you'll need to make sure you have the needed sever component, module, libraries, and/or scripts. e.g. database engine, database manager, and module/library to access the database. While there are many which are ready for use, they are generic and may not provide all of the feature or customizations you need. When this is the case, then you will need to create your own scripts.

Java and Python are both compiled and that's where the error messages come from (the code you write is input into the compiler and it lets you know if there are errors). When you download Java and Python you're downloading the compiler and other associated tools that the compiler uses to create the final binary that is eventually run.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are interpreted languages which means the browser reads and interprets the code you  write at run-time (when the file is opened in the browser). In essense this means that there is no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript download other than a web browser! Just double click your HTML file and by OS default it should open in your default browser.

There are tools you can use to get error messages with interpreted languages. They're called linters. They essentially are grammar and syntax checkers that parse your files. You can download linters (ex - eslint, jslint, csslint, etc) and either run them in the command line or integrate them into your IDE (sublime, visual studio code, etc)

g0rs1g3,i5nmdr,"So your CSS is referencing an element with a class off ""box"" (`.box input...` etc.) and I don't see a class on any of the elements in your html. You add a class to an element like so: `&lt;div class=""box""&gt;` (replace `div` with whatever html element).

Elements can have as many classes as you want really, but you're at least needs to have there box class. Now I'm not sure exactly which element needs that class so you'll have to sift through your tutorial's source code maybe, but that appears to be the issue.

Classes, IDs and other such things are known as selectors. Selectors allow you to apply CSS style to specific elements. Your background and font changes are applied to the `body` element directly, not to a class or anything, which is why it works.

You can select all elements of a certain type by just calling the element name in your CSS (`body, div, table`, etc.)

Classes in css are always preceded by a . (`.box` for example), while IDs are preceded by #. An element can only have 1 ID and no two elements on a page can have the same ID.

Look for info on CSS specificity and selectors to learn the ins and outs. It sounds complicated, and in some ways it is, but it's an integral part of understanding code and ultimately it's not too bad to pick up.",3.0

Simplest way to explain this is you can have a UL with the class of ""nav"" and set all of the LIs within it to have the style you want

`&lt;ul  class=""nav""&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will be inline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So will this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`

In your style, anything with no dot before it is an element. So setting a style for just ""ul"" would affect all ""ul"" elements. Anything with a # before it applies to anything with that ID. So #nav would get applied to the element with the id of ""nav."" Since you want multiple navs, and you shouldn't duplicate IDs, you can cascade from a class. A class has a . before it.

fzgg9xn,hyyhsr,"It looks like you're using `onfocus=""...""` rather than `onblur=""...""`, so first off you should switch that. If you want to pass the object representing the form input element itself to `checkIfNotEmpty()`, you could pass `this`: 

```&lt;input type=""text"" name=""firstname"" id=""firstname"" onblur=""checkIfNotEmpty(this)""&gt;```

Or if you only wanted to send the string value the user has entered, you could do this:
```&lt;input type=""text"" name=""firstname"" id=""firstname"" onblur=""checkIfNotEmpty(this.value)""&gt;```

That said, instead of doing ad-hoc validation like this, you should check out the [HTML5 Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation).

```&lt;input type=""text"" name=""firstname"" id=""firstname"" required&gt;```

Using the `required` attribute has the added benefit of programmatically indicating that the field is required (and invalid if left blank) to people using assistive technologies like screen-readers.

fzektdw,hyrta2,"You just need to understand how they work. Don't expect yourself to memorise it all :) 

Knowing basic colour names like red blue green obviously is the good start.

RGB would be next and so you can have more control over gradients and then RGBA will let you mess around with opacity, you really only need to know those 2.

Some IDE's like Visual Studio have colour pickers so you just point and click for a colour.

Hex is used a bit as well so might be worth having a look at it.

Honestly wouldn't stress out about it to much, just understand how to Google what is this colour in hex and you're fine",3.0
fzerjlb,hyrta2,"I wouldn't worry about memorising them - you just need to understand what they do.

* **rgb() -** 0-255 values for red / green / blue channels - ie. `rgb(255,0,0)` would be pure red, `rgb(0,255,0)` would be pure green, and `rgb(255,255,0)` would even-out between red and green- giving yellow.  You don't need to memorise these though - and you can just use a colour-picker online.  Mostly you won't use this, you'll tend to reach for rgba instead...
* **rgba()** \- the same as above, but it has a 4th 'alpha' channel for transparency, so `rgba(255,0,0,0.5)` would be pure red at 50% transparency - useful for when you want to make you background transparent in css.
* **hex** \- exactly the same as RGB but instead of 0-255 it goes 0-15 using hexadecimal numbers 0123456789ABCDEF. So `#FF000` would be pure red, `#00FF00` would be blue, and `#FFFF00` would be yellow.  This is the go-to one 90% of the time whenever you don't need alpha in your colour
* **hsl** \- this is a different system of *hue, saturation, lightness* ***-*** where **hue** is 0-360 degrees of which colour you pick (traversing the colour-wheel starting at red and ending at red), **saturation** is 0-100% how intense the colour is - with 0 being washed-out no colour, and 100 being full-colour intensity, and **lightness** being 0-100% how bright the colour is - ie. sliding along the black / white scale.  This is useful for when you have the colour you want, but you want to desaturate it a bit, or make it less bright etc. Doing that wit hex or rgb is tricky, but with hsl it's just tweaking the obvious number.
* **hsla -** the same as **hsl** but with an additional **alpha** channel - as per **rgba**.

I hope that helps to make everything clearer and less overhwelming!  Basically, you just need to pick the colour system that gives you control over what you need:

* Just need a colour? Use hex.
* Do you need alpha included in your colour? use rgba.
* Need to change the brightness / saturation of your colour easily? use hsl or hsla.

fzf2r53,hyrta2,"&gt; hsl and hsla


So I had no idea this existed ... doggone it.",1.0
fzg8d35,hyrta2,"Like others have said, memorizing everything is kinda pointless, but learning how they work is valuable. Memorize a few hex colors (`#fff` is white, `#000` is black; maybe find a couple nice greys you like) and you'll probably be fine.

Now hsl/hsla I find incredibly useful as, in my opinion, it's the easiest to manipulate accurately. You want a slightly darker/lighter shade of your current color? Just lower the L value. Want the same lightness and saturation but a different color? Tweak the H value. Want to slightly desaturate your submit button until all the fields are filled? Drop that S value. Super cool.

I use hsl almost exclusively when establishing my palette in Photoshop or whatever. It's the easiest way to fine tune color, especially if you're looking for consistent hues, saturations, or lightnesses. 

That said, I usually just use hex (when I don't need opacity) and rgba (when I DO need opacity) in CSS for some reason lol. Old habits die hard 🤷🏻

open chrome normally.

press f11 (it goes fullscreen)

this way it goes fullscren and no space at all is wasted

if you need it for multitasking and you can't go full screen. then still using a modern chrome just press Ctrl+- and zoom out the page. so that way there is more ""space"" in the page

good luck

fzckua3,hybnbu,"So I think there are quite a few issues here. First of all, I'm having a hard time trying to picture the end goal here, but setting `position: fixed` on everything seems like it's not the right idea. Items with fixed position are positioned based on the viewport and stay there basically no matter what. A good example would be a fixed header. Do if you set `position: fixed` on everything, nothing is ever going to ""move"" from their initial viewport-defined location (your top, right, bottom, left values).

Second, setting a height is almost definitely not your answer as in most cases, with some exceptions for sure, you should let your content determine the actual height of your elements. If you're worried about things sitting side by side having the same height, you're probably looking for `display: flex` or `display: grid`. Use `padding` to ensure sufficient space between your content and the borders/edges of its container and `margin` to set space between containers.

So if all of your elements are fixed, your page isn't scrolling because, presumably, nothing is positioned outside the initial viewport and, therefore, the page doesn't need to scroll. 

All that said, maybe I'm just completely misunderstanding your goal. Even so, while there are no true universal truths with CSS, I feel like you could potentially misunderstanding some of the properties you're using. Could be wrong, though. Like I said, I'm not completely sure I understood the original concept.",1.0
fzcmvhf,hybnbu,"Let me follow this up by saying the most commonly used `position` property is the default, `static` (that's what it will be if you don't declare a `position`. CSS positioning usually just isn't necessary; positioned elements are typically the exception, not the rule. Typically, it's best to just let the natural flow of elements determine position, then add `position` and/or `top | right | bottom | left` if necessary.

I'd venture to say `position: fixed` might be the least commonly used. I might use it for a ""back to top"" button or like a chat button kinda thing or a header/nav, but that's about it. 

Absolute positioning positions elements relative to their closest positioned ancestor, meaning if the parent element has a position of anything but static, you top will be the top of the parent element. If none of the ancestor elements are positioned, `absolute` will be based on the `&lt;html&gt;` element, which in your case is essentially the viewport since everything is fixed and presumably nothing is extending beyond that initial viewport.

Relative positioning moves an object based on it's naturally occurring position in the flow. I generally only use relative positioning in instances where I want to absolutely position something within that element.

Sticky positioning is the newest option and a fun one to play with. Elements with sticky positioning will scroll until they hot a certain spot, then become fixed (or vice versa if you stick it at the bottom). I've used this on a ton of stuff, from a nav that's under a top bar where I want the nav to stick but not the top bar (top bar scrolls out of viewport, then nav sticks at the top... Pretty common I think) to a bottom bar that stays at the bottom of the viewport until you get to the footer, then starts scrolling as it takes its place at the top of the footer. I've also seen sticky used to make section headings stick while their section's content is in view, then disappear when a new section is reached.

Anyway, that's enough of my rambling...sorry if I'm just way off topic lol",1.0

This can be done via something like Javascript -

1. ""If the answer is correct"" - HTML cant check your answers, but JS can via its DOM manipulation, access the contents of your text box and programattically compare against correct answer. `if (document.getElementById(""&lt;&lt;ur text box id""&gt;&gt;).value = ""&lt;&lt;correct answer&gt;&gt;"") { //do something }`

In this app the creator has opted for validated form inputs on an Alert. This requires less development than a custom modal and doesn't take up screen real estate while the user is playing.

I’m actually the owner. I have another Reddit account specifically for the website but I can’t be bothered finding login for it :).

Basically, I tried very hard to keep this service running. I had enormous amounts of phishing uploads and complaints. Some people even used it for worse, you can imagine what. I even contacted the FBI about it.

I went so far as creating machine learning algorithm to try and detect and delete phishing pages but even just 1% slipping through was really bad at the sheer volume it started taking in.

It’s really unfortunate. I really wanted to be the first that could this type of concept right by utilizing machine learning and other detection techniques to keep the phishing out. But it just wasn’t enough and took up tons of my time.

A person created a similar website HTML Save and contacted me as they had the same problem. They are also struggling with this and have nowhere near the volume I did. It’s a difficult problem to solve and hosts don’t want to deal with this type of service so they disable your account.

I’ll create a blog post about this on the site soon. I know it kinda vanished without explanation but I work on a lot of other stuff.

`&lt;div w3-include-html=""includes/navbar.html""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

fyxscwr,hviv92,"To put it simply;

* **HTML** - provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
* **CSS** - is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.
* **JavaScript** - is used to control the behavior of different elements

Not all sites require JavaScript, but it seems you have a website that DOES require JavaScript - so the fact the site breaks when you remove the script suggests that the script is doing more than you think it is.

Building websites is more than just copy and pasting code. You kinda need to understand what is doing what and why.

[Here's an article](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-html-css-javascript) that will help explain the differences between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Also, using chrome inspector to copy all the HTML is a bad idea, as extensions can embed code etc in to the site (depending on the type of extension) so you might also be copying more code than the actual site is producing.",1.0
fyxxcks,hviv92,"Yes I know the differences between them all. 

And yes I do know that some sites do require JS \*to load\* and \*to function\*. But the thing I didn't think was possible was that there could be a site that somehow requires JS to render despite the CSS already existing in the page. 

Again, I pulled the HTML/CSS after the page had already rendered, so it seems very strange that I would need JS to still view the site at that instance. That makes no sense to me.",1.0
fyy0su4,hviv92,"Are you able to post an example in a [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen/) and we may be able to explain better what is happening when you remove said line.

Even though you are copying the code AFTER render; the script still does something the second that line is called - so removing that line will change behaviour of the site.

It's kinda like removing a leg of a chair and wondering why the balance is off; all you did was remove a leg AFTER the chair was built - so why does 3 legs not work like 4 legs?

I'm not saying I'm right in this instance; I'm just trying to explain what *could* be going wrong.",1.0
fyy5nam,hviv92,"Sure, here's a fiddle [https://jsfiddle.net/rasen58/w81grvuL/](https://jsfiddle.net/rasen58/w81grvuL/)

If you run it as is, you should see a basic site that looks like it has no css being rendered.

If you ctrl+f search for ""vendor"", and uncomment that line, and then run it again, you'll see that it renders properly.

I appreciate you looking at this! I don't think the js is adding any more css, since all the css should already be present, but the vendor.js file is pretty big, so I'm not sure where in it, it's doing this strange thing. (you should just be able to open the vendor.js url in your browser to see its code)",1.0
fyy958t,hviv92,"It seems there are other scripts etc that appear dependant on ``vendor.js`` which is why it seems the page breaks or does not rendering properly.

Are you copying from VIEW SOURCE, or are you copying from the ELEMENTS view within Chrome Inspector?

VIEW SOURCE won't show you all the stuff the JavaScript is doing after render - however the ELEMENTS view within Chrome Inspector will.. you can right click on the ``&lt;html`` element immediately after ``&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`` and choose ``edit as HTML`` then copy and paste everything.

The other thing I noticed is all the ``$ is not defined`` errors when ``vendor.js`` is removed; this tells me that the jQuery library is within that ``vendor.js``. So you have other scripts not running due to them being dependant on jQuery.

I was able to get better results when I went through the fiddle you posted and stripped it of all ``&lt;script&gt;`` tags.

Another thing you can do is right click on the page that renders properly and choose ""save as.."" this will download all the relevant files etc and you may have better luck picking apart the things you want or don't want as it will give you all the files locally. Ensure you save it in a **New Folder**; because when saving it seems you are only saving a single HTML file, but it will infact download all other relevant files and images etc.",1.0
fyzha6k,hviv92,"I copied from the elements view. I did exactly that by right clicking on the `html` element and selected all of that text so the fiddle I sent has all the rendered elements and css. 

I also tried removing all the `&lt;script&gt;` tags but that didn't improve the rendering at all for me? Here's an updated fiddle with all the script tags and imported js commented out: https://jsfiddle.net/rasen58/w81grvuL/12/


Re: ""save as"" - I tried this but the rendering looked the same. In the console, I saw a few errors, and one was `Access to script at 'file:///Users/x/Desktop/sentry_save_as/Issues%20-%20duplex%20-%20Sentry_files/vendor.js' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https.` - so it seems like I wouldn't be able to open this locally. Since locally, the file uri is `file:///Users/x/Desktop/sentry_save_as/Issues%20-%20duplex%20-%20Sentry.htm`",1.0
fz0qjfx,hviv92,"Hm, so I was mistaken before when I said that when I saved the html that it also saved all the css.

I see now that in the html for the sentry page, there are tags like this

\`&lt;style data-emotion=""css-global""&gt;&lt;/style&gt;\` and \`&lt;style data-emotion=""css""&gt;&lt;/style&gt;\` that are empty. And I think that in the JS files, they are there defining what the css-global class is.

But the very strange thing is that chrome cannot see what those classes are defined as!

If I click on &lt;style&gt; on right side for the \`css-mvp2rv-StyledSidebar-responsiveFlex\` class, then the chrome inspector just takes me to this line again \`&lt;style data-emotion=""css""&gt;&lt;/style&gt;\`

 [https://i.imgur.com/5rr9CaX.png](https://i.imgur.com/5rr9CaX.png)

&amp;#x200B;

So somehow, the CSS class is visible to the HTML page, but it's somehow not visible in chrome to the end user!

Any ideas on how this is possible?",1.0
fz0s7h8,hviv92,"I think I discovered a way!

I was able to access the css programatically and here it seems like all css rules will be defined this way.

&amp;#x200B;

I still don't understand why the css rules aren't present in the actual dom though since even if they are loaded by external JS, they should still be present in the dom when I do right click -&gt; edit as html. Any thoughts on that?",1.0

1. https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction

So it kinda goes back to what I was saying before;

&gt; JavaScript - is used to control the behavior of different elements

Which in this instance, seems to be some heavy control of the elements on a level I've never really seen or known about until now. It appears that the javascript references some global table that's hard to see on a client end unless you have all the source files - your only real way of seeing these styles is directly clicking the element and copy-pasting each one's class in a new style sheet and then calling on that. That's some serious reverse engineering required haha.",1.0

From there go wherever you want,  Images with transparency, menu navigation, embedded content, types of buttons and inputs, etc.

fymv2tl,hucuit,"I learned it fluently in about a month watching YouTube. HTML is basically tags. Pug HTML is a lot easier to use once you get how the tags work. CSS is just referencing the id/class of an html tag and it has a whole list of properties you can use. I just google stuff like “css change font” or something and it gives me the font-size property.

In a nutshell it’s like this
HTML:
&lt;tag id=variablename&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;

CSS
#variablename{
  font-size: 20px;
  color: red;

  css property: value;

fyow3c0,ht3mzd,"Ah gotcha.  I see it now.  It looks like you figured it out.  Nice work!

Another solution would be to use min-width instead of width on your S and F sidebars.  See this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/wjm5x0qa/

Edit: Be careful with using percent based widths as it can be brittle and create layout issues on different sized screens.  For example, a smaller screen may collapse the width of the S and F sidebars if you're using a width percentage that works for your dev screen and a larger screen may expand them so they dont look as nice.",1.0

width:calc(100vw - 50px - 50px);
^^ This has saved me from having to write a lot of unnecessary media queries to adjust the percentage widths.

Thank you for you example! I greatly appreciate it 👍",2.0
fywr2as,ht3mzd,Happy to help! Sometimes I get it right. I'm glad this was one of those times lol,1.0
fyopyri,ht3mzd,"**SOLUTION:**  
I found out that the reason it was pushing the kendo grid outside of the child elements and stretching siblings was because I was using hardcoded widths for the child elements.

fyd5eyy,hsomjn,"How new tab is created with `open()` depends on the web browser, which is different across different web browsers.

i.e. whether new tab is always activated or not; and whether new tab is placed directly after the tab which created it, or placed at the end of the list of tabs.

e.g. in Firefox, the new tab is created directly after the tab that created it, while in Chrome, it's created at the end of the list of tabs. So in Firefox, the final list of tabs would be: url1, url5, url4, url3, url2.

IIRC in Firefox, this behaviour is configurable via `about:config` page. While in Chrome, it's not configurable at all. This includes the behaviour whether new tab is always activated or not.

While none of them are configurable via JavaScript, in Firefox, you can make it so that the order of the opened URLs are not reversed, and the last tab will be the one which is activated instead of the 2nd one.

The basic idea is to run the exact same task in each tab, but with different list of URLs. The main job of the task is to first check the given list of URLs (in an array), which will have 5 URLs initially in the initial tab. If the URL list has more than one URL, pass the 2nd and the rest of the URLs to the new tab and make the new tab execute the same task. Then for the current tab, navigate to the first URL from the list. So, the task (or each tab) only create one new tab, instead of multiple. Because each task/tab will have lesser number of URLs in the given URL list, it'll eventually stop creating new tabs.

i.e. the overview of the whole process:

    tab1: [url1, url2, url3, url4, url5]
      new tab#2: [url2, url3, url4, url5]
      new URL: url1
    tab2: [url2, url3, url4, url5]
      new tab#3: [url3, url4, url5]
      new URL: url2
    tab3: [url3, url4, url5]
      new tab#4: [url4, url5]
      new URL: url3
    tab4: [url4, url5]
      new tab#4: [url5]
      new URL: url4
    tab5: [url5]
      new URL: url5

Am I doing that right? It doesn't appear to even launch. And so I'm unable to check to see if the first tab is focused like I was hoping.

Also if I'm understanding you right, the only possibility in Firefox is to have it focus the LAST tab? Not the first one?",1.0

&gt; Also if I'm understanding you right, the only possibility in Firefox is to have it focus the LAST tab? Not the first one?

It's not a matter of first or last. It's relative. By default Firefox setting, new tab created using JavaScript is placed directly following the tab which created it. e.g. assume that initially we have 3 tabs: `tabA, tabB, tabC`. If `tabA` creates a new `tabD`, we'll have this list of tabs: `tabA, tabD, tabB, tabC`; with `tabD` in focus. If then `tabC` creates `tabE`, we'll have this: `tabA, tabD, tabB, tabC, tabE`; with `tabE` in focus. If then `tabA` creates `tabF`, we'll have this: `tabA, tabF, tabD, tabB, tabC, tabE`; with `tabF` in focus. So, a tab created using JavaScript is always placed to the right of the creator tab, and the new tab always has focus.",1.0

As you can tell, I'm new at this. This is a html file I use for my homepages. Each day it's 3 of the same home page tabs but one different one (e.g. I read a cooking website on Sundays). 


Two last questions: 

- Sometimes the tab won't load. It's just blank. Refersh launches the entire html script not the page. 

- Is there ANYWAY TO MODIFY anything so that the first tab is focused. Why was the 2nd tab focused on the original version I gave you? If we can do the 2nd tab, why not the first? 

THANK YOU for any more help. I owe you.

fyfr2zb,hsomjn,"&gt; Why was the 2nd tab focused on the original version I gave you? If we can do the 2nd tab, why not the first?

Remember the rule which I have mentioned before: JavaScript created tab is always placed directly following/after the creator tab, and is always be focused. This is a rule which can not be changed. At least not without the help of a browser extension.

The reason why the 2nd tab is focused instead of the first/last one, is because the 1st tab is the one which creates all of the new tabs. i.e. the first tab is the creator tab. So each newly created tab in inserted between the 1st and 2nd ones. The new tab appended into the tab list if there's no 2nd tab yet.

&gt; Is there ANYWAY TO MODIFY anything so that the first tab is focused.

No. But there's a way to make the 1st tab be focused again after the focus has changed to the new tabs (after all tabs has been created). There's `focus()` function to change the focus to current tab, but it's disabled by default. To enable it, open the `about:config` page, type in `flip`, then change the `dom.disable_window_flip` setting from `true`, to `false`. Finally, for the JavaScript code, replace the `task()` function with below. It should also fix the blank tab problem.

    function task(urls, next) {
      if (urls.length &gt; 1) {
        addEventListener(""message"", function(ev) {
          if (ev.data === ""createdAllTabs"") {
            if (opener &amp;&amp; next) {
              opener.postMessage(""createdAllTabs"", ""*"");
            } else {
              focus();
            }
          }
        });

          ],
          {type: ""text/html""}
        );
        open(URL.createObjectURL(blob));

Two final requests if you'd be so kind.

- Is there a way to change the name of the tab that displays while it's loading. Can I make it match the url? It's some weird long strings of numbers now.

- Sometimes the tabs don't load. is there a way to fix?

edit. Here's the html now as I have it.

Like mine goes &lt;body&gt; then &lt;header&gt; then &lt;form&gt;, all of these being nested in the previous one. But yours is just &lt;header&gt; by itself, then &lt;form&gt; by itself, with no &lt;body&gt;. Why is that? I don't really understand the tag hierarchy in HTML

Yours also lacks the beginning stuff. Why?:

    &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
    &lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    	&lt;title&gt; Assignment 7 &lt;/title&gt;

Or instead of (only) manually explaining these things, could you point me towards some resources to learn these sort of things?",1.0
fyrw9sh,hshvso,"Sure, so the quick answer is specifically because we've built this example on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io).  We simply don't need it.

Codepen makes it very easy to play with and share code without getting bogged down by hosting concerns and a minimal amount of boilerplate.  I'd guess theres also technical concerns on their end because its kind of a ""website within a website"" that they provide.

That being said when you would go to deploy a website / webpage, those those tags are very much needed to give the browser valuable information about the page and to begin fetching the content you've requested.  For example in your codepen on line 6 you're requesting a css file as an external resource via the link tag, but that request is failing with a 404 (not found) because its on codepen.  In your own hosting environment, you'd want to make sure that file was actually there.  The MDN on the [html tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html) is short and sweet.

fyblfca,hs3nyl,"There are **[three ways](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)** to modify the styling (including colour) of an element. Most theme authors on tumblr use internal CSS, which I'll assume is how you want to change it.

You'll need to know the name of the element (the selector) and the colour you want to change it to. You can find out the element in most browsers by right clicking the element &gt; Inspect. To get the colour, you can either use **[the colour name or the colour value](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp)** (most people use HEX code).

Then you write it out like this:

    selector {
        color: red!important;
    }

* If the element has an id value (e.g. `div id=""some_name""`), you write the selector as `#some_name`.
* If the element has a class value (e.g. `div class=""some_name""`), you write the selector as `.some_name`.
* The `color:red` part is known as a declaration. Notice that semi-colon at the end? That's essentially the computer equivalent of a full stop. Don't forget to include it at the end of your declarations!
* You can use `!important` to override certain styling. This isn't usually good practice and not something I'd recommend doing for anything serious, but for lightly modifying a theme like this, it can save some effort.
* If you're confused, I'd recommend reading more on CSS **[syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp)** and **[selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)**, as well as checking out the other resources on that website.

As an example, to change the colour of the page links at the top:

    &lt;style type=""text/css"" media=""screen""&gt;
    /* some css here */
    #header #pages a, #header #pages a:visited {
        color:red!important;   
    }
    /* etc. */
    &lt;/style&gt;

If you're having trouble, I've uploaded the edits you've requested onto pastebin as both **[part of the theme](https://pastebin.com/dngGTiDu)** and **[individually](https://pastebin.com/sHEnuswh)**, although you may want to make your own further edits (such as link hover colour).

I've added the edits as meta variables, which means you can change the colours in Tumblr's theme options. You can read more about theme options and meta variables **[here](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes#theme-options)**.",1.0

Right-click on the logo of your site. Choose ""Inspect Element"" (assuming your browser has the inspection feature, which most do). You'll see the element class .site\_logo has the background image value of background-image: url(""./images/site\_logo.svg"");

Since your site is actually at /world/ and not at the root, you need to make the images relative. That's what that dot is for.

fy6clk0,hrfq95,"Tl;Dr yes, everybody should learn html. It's really not terribly hard.

I've been fiddling with html and CSS got something like 15 years in various capacities and developed a pretty strong mental library of elements and best practices. But I'd never had any formal training really, so a while back I saw an ad for Jen Simmons's course on LinkedIn Having on html and decided to brush up.

After going through that course (which I think is like 4 hours maybe) and I was honestly shocked by how much I got out of it. I mean there was a ton of stuff I knew already, but Jen goes just deep enough into the why and how without getting too far into the weeds.

I appreciated her coverage of things like sections, articles, figures and some of the other ""newer"" elements, but one surprising thing I sort of discovered is that there's actually a semantic difference between `&lt;i&gt;` elements and `&lt;em&gt;` elements, as well as `&lt;b&gt;` and `&lt;strong&gt;`. I also oatmeal about the `&lt;time&gt;` element. There were several other little tidbits like that.

So all that you say this. Html is the foundation of the web and I believe everyone (even those outside the web industry) should have some basic understanding if it. More so, I believe anybody working in the web world in any capacity (from developers and programmers down to graphic designers and copywriters) should have a passable understanding of html page structure and the common formatting elements.

If you're gonna be a developer, you should probably be deeply familiar and continually learning as much about HTML and possible. With nothing but html, you can build a completely responsive, semantically correct website. That's the core. It'll look ugly as hell, especially on big screens (1920px wide sentences anybody?), but it can be done.

fy3lzz6,hre2uw,I’m not sure any developer can claim to be 100% confident: continual learning is part of the job.,4.0
fy43och,hre2uw,"I think the way you're thinking about it will potentially drag you down and slow you down.

HTML, CSS and JS are routinely being expanded, and they have a lot of features. Many of them you might never use, or use once or twice as a developer. Many others, you will use constantly. It doesn't make any sense to want to learn everything. This is a clear example where you should focus on learning the 20% you will use more often, and put aside the rest. If you need something that you don't know, you will just research and google. You don't need to store all that information in your brain. And even if you try, you will google it anyway to see exactly how people do it.

So, trying to learn 100% of HTML before moving to CSS is not productive, and the same from CSS to JS. You have to change the way you see it. These are tools to build websites, nothing else. A better goal should be to build progressively more complex things, until you can build a complex project on your own.

So don't over complicate things. Pick a free course like freecodecamp and follow it. You can't just learn ALL HTML, CSS and JS.

If you insist to learn everything about everything you will never end. There are just so many tools and things to learn. In fact, the more you learn the more you will realize you don't know. Focus on making projects.",2.0

The thing about HTML is that when writing it, you can view specifically what line you messed up on, but with python and other similar languages if you get an error, it could be anywhere within the code, if you keep practicing just writing random websites or making your own blog website (heck i done a tutorial on Kali Linux when learning HTML). If I was you i would slowly integrate into the other languages, make sure you can get a shabby website going with HTML then clean it up with some css, then you might decide all of a sudden you want to import a script in java into your code, just take it slow and keep practicing.

Html is just markup. It's just saying, an image goes here, and there's some text here, ooh and a heading here.

Ok I jest, it's a bit more complex than that, but only because there's a lot more nesting. Conceptually, everything you need to know about html is right up above.

But without css and JavaScript, there's no point to html. It's be like having the scaffolding for a car without a body or an engine. So just start with html and css and then start picking up JS when you need your projects to do something (as opposed to look a certain way)",1.0

fxprv7b,hpam31,"Here’s my general approach when it comes to approaching a new design and building it with html. 

* Write all your HTML markup first. Think of this as writing an outline for a paper or figuring out what you want to display on your page. Writing only html allows you to focus on the semantics of your page. Figure out where to place your headers, what your major sections are and what the page hierarchy is. Doing this will encourage you to write proper markup without having to worry about styles.
* Once you have all the content on your page, start working on the layout. Focus only on the relationships between elements and how they will interact with each other. Sometimes you will have to go back and add additional markup for things like creating containers or wrapping certain elements. At this stage you should be thinking only about how you want your elements to flow on the page.
* Finally, it’s time to add style. This is where you go through and figure out colors, spacing, borders etc. By now all your content should exist on the page and be properly laid out, so here you’re just adding the final polish to make everything look presentable. 

This more or less follows the [BEM approach](http://getbem.com/introduction/) to CSS. First create your blocks, then define your elements, and finally add the modifier styles. You’ll find that this approach works really well in ensuring that form follows function, or that your page works completely without ever touching styles first.",3.0

Then next year, the dates will update automatically instead of somebody having to scrub the site manually.

All that to say there may be instances of both ""30 years"" and ""since 1990"" in various contexts. I might add an option to choose whether to display the origin year, the current year, or the difference between them into the plugin but idk... Maybe not. It's really just a pet project anyway 🤷🏻

fxelw3r,hnly5r,"I may have misunderstood the question, but I can address some of these

&gt;Is having just `&lt;time&gt;` without the datetime attribute bad code?

It's not bad, but it largely defeats the point.  If you mark it up then it's possible that something *may* make use of it, but you haven't really added much to the content of the page.  The `datetime` is used to make an abstract period of time a more precise one - eg. 

    &lt;time datetime=""2020/07/08""&gt;yesterday&lt;/time&gt;

&gt; Anyway, if I'm understanding correctly, you're suggesting I calculate the P duration based on days

If you want your `&lt;time&gt;` to represent a duration or a period of time, then this is the way to do it. If you want your `&lt;time&gt;` to represent a fixed point in time, then providing the full stae string is the way to do it.

&gt;  I feel like just calculating the days misrepresents the data 

So calculating the days is the way to use the `P` marker in a datetime - a HTML parser may then take the number of days and convert that to years, if that's what you're worried about?  It's also possible that future revisions to the HTML spec will allow you to use larger denominations in the future and we can do stuff like `P 30 Y`, but it might just been seen as superfluous as days fulfils the use-case fine as-is.

Hope that clarifies!",2.0

Besides, if the `datetime` is a duration, there's no way to know the duration based on the current time, because the starting time for that duration is unknown.

The `&lt;time&gt;` element, as others have said, basically just tells machines that a certain block of text should be regarded as a date or time or span of time or whatever. The basic use is to convert conversational or casually-formatted time references into something the computer can understand consistently. So I could say ""I took out the trash `&lt;time datetime=""2020-07-06""&gt;3 days ago&lt;/time&gt;` and it'll make sense to both the computer and the reader.

fxe24am,hnghdm,"With only HTML, it's not possible to make a row in the middle of a table be shown in a different row location.

Ideally, this should be done using JavaScript. e.g. put below JS code in a SCRIPT element directly after the TABLE element. The script will move the first table row (row index `0`) to the bottom. Change the row index to change which row to move to the bottom.

    (function() {
      var tableBody = document.scripts[document.scripts.length - 1].previousElementSibling.tBodies[0];
      var rowIndex = 0;
      tableBody.appendChild(tableBody.rows[rowIndex]);

fx0vdh2,hlou54,"`&lt;h7&gt;` isn't [a valid heading element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements), and by default, most browsers style unknown elements as `display: inline;`.

That said, there's a number of other issues with your HTML -- it seems like this is navigation, so you shouldn't be using heading elements for the text at all.

Also, it's best to avoid style attributes, because they outrank the importance of any other CSS styles, which makes things harder to maintain. In this case, instead of setting each link to not have text decoration with a style attribute, you could declare this with a single CSS rule:

```css
.gallery a {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

_But_, keep in mind you should also specify `:focus` and `:hover` states for links, for better accessibility.

[`&lt;nav&gt;`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) would be more semantic container for these links, and you probably want to put your images inside the links. Normally you should also specify a description of images in the `alt=""""` attribute so people using assistive technologies to announce the page can understand the content of non-decorative images, but in this case they would be redundant with the link text, so you should specify `alt=""""` on each image, so the browser knows it can skip announcing these and not try to announce the file name as a fallback.

Give this a spin!

This creates a link out of the words Check Me Out and links it to about.html, assuming of course that about.html is in the same folder as index.html.

fwj8s5w,hij3o1,"Assign the `textContext` property of the element you want the value to be displayed.

If you want it be displayed with that `td` element, first, you'll have to get a reference to that element. One of the several methods is to assign a unique ID to it, for easy referencing. e.g.

    &lt;td id=""eleTime""&gt;time1&lt;/td&gt;

Use `document.getElementById()` to get a reference of the element (this is also one of the several possible methods). e.g.

    var ele = document.getElementById(""eleTime"");

Then assign the value to the element's `textContent` property. e.g.

    ele.textContent = ref.time1.value;",1.0

fwgtyk3,hiesuw,"Judging by your classes, you’re using bootstrap 4.x.... and the parent div of the buttons in question is using flex box. Two quick ways to space the two buttons would be

1 - Add a margin to the button(s). You can easily do this by using one of the [spacing utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/spacing/). For example, add “mb-4” to the top button class to give it more of a bottom margin. 

    &lt;div class=""btns d-flex flex-column""&gt;
      &lt;button class=""btn mb-4"" id=""loginBtn""&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button class=""btn"" id=""signUpBtn""&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Sign Up&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


2 - Since the parent display property is set to flex, you can use one of the [flex utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/flex/) to add the one of the appropriate “justify-xxx” classes to the parent. Note that flex-direction of “column” you’re using may require you to specify a height/min-height for the parent to allow certain properties to work.


    &lt;div class=""btns d-flex flex-column justify-content-around"" style=""min-height:150px;""&gt;
      &lt;button class=""btn"" id=""loginBtn""&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button class=""btn"" id=""signUpBtn""&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Sign Up&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;",1.0
fwguyxy,hiesuw,"Since you’re using classes like d-flex and flex-column, I’m going to assume that you’re using Bootstrap &gt;= 4?

If so use one of the mx-* classes. See their documentation on [spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/) for more info.

If you are not, added a class with the margin-left and/or margin-right properties.

fw3nz5t,hg84eu,"In Dev Tools you can observe that the header element gains a class called `scrolled` when the scroll bar is not at the top.

The html element triggers an event on scroll, so I'm guessing it checks `document.documentElement.scrollTop` and uses `element.classList.add()` to add the class to the header element when `scrollTop` is &gt; 0 and `element.classList.remove()` to remove it when `scrollTop` is 0.

However, the actual implementation is probably abstracted from this concept. Historically, [it's a bad idea to trigger functions directly from scroll events.](https://johnresig.com/blog/learning-from-twitter/)

fvwd78o,hf9wf3,"You seem to have a decent grasp of CSS. You are utilizing multiple forms of selectors to style the elements you want in the right way, so nothing wrong there.

That being said, if I copied the HTML markup right, it is completely out of standards even though the browser CAN render it. Here are noticeable problems to me:

* Line 1: The `&lt;script&gt;` tag here should exist only within either the `&lt;head&gt;` or `&lt;body&gt;` tag.
* Line 4: The `&lt;header&gt;` tag here is invalid. The only tags that are allowed to be the immediate child of `&lt;html&gt;` is `&lt;head&gt;` and `&lt;body&gt;`. The `&lt;head&gt;` tag should exist at this line and should exist only once.
* Line 6: The `&lt;body&gt;` tag here is invalid. The `&lt;body&gt;` tag is allowed to exist only once and as an immediate child of `&lt;html&gt;`.
* Line 8: The `&lt;link&gt;` tag here should be placed within the `&lt;head&gt;` tag.
* Line 64 &amp; 65: The `&lt;footer&gt;` and `&lt;/footer&gt;` tags here should exist only within the `&lt;body&gt;` tag.
* Lines 18, 23, 28: The `&lt;label&gt;` tags here is recommended to have the `for=""""` attribute to indicate which form element it corresponds with. You did this correctly for the `&lt;label&gt;` tag on line 33 for the `&lt;select&gt;` form element.

Overall, I would say you have a basic understanding of how HTML works. You put tags within tags and they serve specific purposes. You should read [this article](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/) on a standard HTML page template.

Thank you for your advice. 
I’ve opened phpmyadmin and I’ve tried to connect my sql to my HTML docs but I think I’ve made a mistake somewhere bc my local host number is 8888, but my php and sql server says it’s using the port 8889. I’m not sure if they are meant to be the same or different so they don’t conflict. I have another problem that I’m not sure is related: when I run my live preview through brackets, it tries to access localhost:8888/index.php/index.html, and doesn’t open. I don’t know why it’s suddenly looking for a php page as well, and I don’t know how to change this in the htdoc directory. So this means I can only view my HTML document by opening them in my finder, which doesn’t use a http format- so I guess if I don’t fix it, it will mean I won’t be able to view my site on the internet?? I don’t know, I’m in way over my head haha",1.0
fvzwx37,hdr2dl,"If you are opening the file directly through Finder, and not through localhost, you are not running the file on the web server. Don’t do it this way. You should be able to go to localhost:8888 in your browser and see your html page. Web servers generally by default load index.html without having to include the file name. Same goes for index.php, but if you have both, the server will default to index.html and you WILL have to type in index.php if you want to see that instead of index.html.

You are right, default mamp ports are 8888 for the webroot (where php and html are run) and 8889 for MySQL. Yes, they should be different.

You can’t connect to MySQL in html. It has to be from php.  You would use the info on the mamp start page, in the MySQL section, to connect to the database from php. You can use phpmyadmin or one of the apps to browse your database. The same info sections tells you what you need to put in an app to connect.

g0ez7cx,hdf3eo,"Alright, so i'll just assume the structure of your HTML is something like this:

**index.html**

    &lt;head&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    ...
        &lt;table id=""our-table""&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

If your table doesn't have an ID yet, give it one so we can easily find it using JavaScript. Even though there isn't much code we need right now, we should put it all in a seperate js file in case there'll be more in the future ([Here's an article explaining the basics](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp#:~:text=JavaScript%20in%20or%20%3C,HTML%20page%2C%20or%20in%20both)).

So we'll create a file called ""script.js"" in the same directory as our html file and add some stuff to it:

**script.js**

    let ourTable = document.getElementByID(""our-table"");
    let newTable = ourTable.cloneNode(true);

Now we need to decide where exactly to put the cloned Table. For that we'll need a reference object in your HTML-page, that we want to place the table **BEFORE.**

I'll just assume you'll have some kind of footer on your page, that we want to place it before, so our HTML now looks like this:

**index.html**

    &lt;head&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        ...
        &lt;table id=""our-table""&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/table&gt;
        ...
        &lt;div id=""footer""&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

Notice i gave it an ID again so we can easily find it in JavaScript.Speaking of which, let's get back to that:

**script.js**

    let ourTable = document.getElementByID(""our-table"");
    let newTable = ourTable.cloneNode(true);
    let footer = document.getElementByID(""footer"");
    
    document.insertBefore(newTable, footer);

Lastly, so our script can be run, we have to include it into our HTML like so:

**index.html**

    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script src='script.js' defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

The defer attribute means, that the script won't run until the page has completely loaded, otherwise it would run before the body was rendered, which won't work because at that point the table doesn't exist in the DOM yet.

If you have any more questions let me know!",1.0

Or only store the API ID/key in the server, but never store the password anywhere, if you want the password to be prompted to the user.

It'd be best to store the credentials outside of the PHP, because if the PHP script encounter an unexpected error, there's a risk that the credentials or a hint for it may be exposed.

&gt; When you say 'my own web server' does that mean set one up and store the credentials in -  and then request the pw and id from the php file? Sorry i'm new to this.

The credentials are stored in the same server as your PHP file (in the same system/computer). The client sends the form like normal as if no API is involved, to your form handler PHP.

1) You are assigning class=""popup"" to your text  ""myself""

BUT you want the actual popup to be done by other 2 elements below it

2) You are trying to toggle your desc and ur image, but you are actually toggling only the descr cos ur using an ID selector, which only applies to desc, not to the image

 var popup = document.getElementById(""myPopup""); 

3) The elements u want to toggle do not have that class in first place, so you cant toggle a class you are not applying to the element. You need to assign the class ""show"" to them first

 &lt;span class=""popuptext"" id=""myPopup""&gt;My description &lt;/span&gt; &lt;img src=""/images/picture.jpg"" alt=""My picture""&gt;

fv1jsew,haa7gr,I'm trying to add this thing inside a embeded youtube video and since I am a beginner I don't know any other way to do that.. Is that possible to do?,-1.0
fv23s1d,haa7gr,"Technically speaking, yes you can do this using pseudo elements and the content attribute:

CSS:

    .foreground-text::before {
        content: ""Your text here"";
    }

HTML:

    &lt;div class=""foreground-text""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

and any element that has the `foreground-text` class will render the text content in its before pseudo element.

***HOWEVER THIS IS POOR PRACTICE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED!***

In case that wasn't clear enough I'm going to repeat it:

***DO NOT DO THS!***

There are many reasons not to do this. CSS is meant to provide styling to semantic HTML page structure only and ***not*** generate content. Using the above method will result in unexpected outcomes like confusing screen readers, confusing SEO crawlers and more. I think what you actually want is a way to quickly find and replace all instances of a string of text in your HTML document. Depending on your IDE there should be some sort of ""Find and replace all"" menu option. This is your best option as you're not dynamically adding/overriding HTML text nodes during runtime in the browser.",0.0

If the form data is stored in a database in a web server, ideally, the page which need the form data will need to request the form data using XHR. Meaning that the web server will need to provide a server side script such as PHP to retrieve the form data from the database, then return it to the client. Other alternative is to include the form data within the page which need the form data. Meaning that *that* page will need to be a server side script because part of its document depends on what data was inputted into the form - which can be anything.

fuy2b7a,h9nhdx,"HTML by itself is mainly responsible for content and structure, CSS does the heavy lifting in terms of visuals. DOM manipulation such as adding rows to a html table is done by Javascript (JS)

Excel is specifically designed as a spreadsheet program so rows and columns formatting is easier, you can achieve something similar using html+css+javascript but it would require some coding knowledge.

Here’s an example of the accessible and semantic way to build a navigation bar on a website. It uses a `&lt;nav&gt;` element, an unordered list and anchor tags for navigation. 

    &lt;nav&gt;
    	&lt;ul&gt;
    		&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=“./home.html”&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

fup8jur,h82zn3,See my reply to u/lovesrayray2018,1.0
fuqtti9,h82zn3,"So I was looking at it, seems you want your menu dropdowns to also have nested dropdowns, looks like your struggling with positioning the nested dropdown. Might need to look into css positioning (absolute vs relative, how does an absolute element position itself). 
Also seems like the way you target elements is a bit overkill, for example .navbar .menu li a {color:white;} could just be .menu a, or make proper use of an id #main-menu a {color:white}

To the next point, you also are using a bunch of identical ids, ids should be unique and never repeated. I rarely use ids personally, only use case I could see to use them for you would be an id of ""main-nav"" and ""main-menu"" (or somethin, the id should be unique and descriptive), added main incase you ever wanted to add a ""mobile-nav"" or some other kind of alt nav.

I guess my question would be, do you really need to have a complicated navbar? If you have a ton of info to display then I could understand, but the UX needs to be done well otherwise it will be an annoyance to the user.
Also often times if I'm stuck I think to myself, am I the first person to do this (definitely not)? So google ""nested menu html"" or something, look around and observe other examples, see if they can inspire your code (don't just copy, if you're trying to learn)
I personally would probably reach toward a css library like bootstrap (or material) for the sake of time, but I can also respect trying to build it on your own if you want to focus on css skills.

ftlvnij,h0etkb,"So here is a basic rough draft of how I would go about it, I built this just with html and css in separate files because that's how I do it. https://jsbin.com/siqevefena/edit?html,output

If you toggle the html and css tabs you can see the output fullscreen to give a better idea on the centering.
The css specifics like width and font size could be changed depending on your preferences.

I think the general take away is just observe the formatting and see if it works for you, there might be room for improvement, I'm basically making use of containers/wrappers and the magic of flex, https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp

If you like this approach then you could use the idea, PHP-ify it if you will (I'm not a php guy but I could figure it out), and move the css properties to inline css if that's how you want to roll. You might also need to consider edge cases, like what if the dynamic text values are really long etc, which could require refactor.

Well, here's what I can tell you:

The law enforcement agency currently looking into your request, and your history, is known as the FBI. If they find you are not in the United States, it will be forwarded to Interpol. If the site you are attempting to access is overseas, they will coordinate with Interpol.

Anyone you've had any communication with that isn't perfectly clear that this is an awful idea (because, holy shit, this is an awful idea), may also get a quick once-over concerning this. Hell, I expect to get a once-over because I'm replying to you, just telling you that you're looking to violate a wide range of State, Federal, and International laws, depending on exactly where everything is physically located.

While, generally speaking, they'll look at the incident as a whole, and realize it was just stupidity that caused you to think that 'this is okay' for some reason, and unlikely that anyone will actually stop by to say hi, it does entirely torpedo your chances of ever gaining a government clearance later in life. Fun thing you can do in 5 years is submit a FOIA request on yourself, so you can read up on everything they figured out about you because of this!

ft1ipt7,gx6kh0,"Hey there!

Your element IDs need to be unique in order for your showPage function to execute properly. Looking at your HTML file, you have four &lt;div&gt;'s with the same ""myDiv"" ID.

To fix the issue, you can do one of two things:

1. Update the id of each of your four &lt;div&gt; element's with a unique ID like ""myDiv1"", ""myDiv2"", ""myDiv3"" and ""myDiv4"" and then update your showPage function accordingly:  
 function showPage() {  
document.getElementById(""loader"").style.display = ""none"";  
document.getElementById(""myDiv1"").style.display = ""block"";  
document.getElementById(""myDiv2"").style.display = ""block"";  
document.getElementById(""myDiv3"").style.display = ""block"";  
document.getElementById(""myDiv4"").style.display = ""block"";  
  }
2. Remove the style and id attributes from  your 4 ""page-appear"" &lt;div&gt;'s and then wrap  within a single &lt;div style=""display:none;"" id=""myDiv""&gt; element. This allows you to leave your showPage function as is.",2.0

On the server side, I would always keep files separately; you can then assemble and minify files before delivering them to the user. This way you get the best of both worlds, and will still be able to work on your files locally without compromising productivity and maintainability.

However, as you improve your CSS skills, you will find that even CSS files should not typically grow too large when using selectors carefully. Sadly, I see a lot of crap created by inexperienced coders, and it is a hell to work with. Embedded vs external CSS is a very small concern in comparison.

I personally also run my CSS through SASS to minify it. For JavaScript you can use babel, and there are server plugins for HTML minification as well.

 I'm sure someone else can explain it better than I do but here goes.

Let's pretend you have a website with this url: [`http://www.example.com/`](http://www.example.com/index.html) Your homepage would be at something like `http://www.example.com/index.html`

The root of your website.

If you want to link to a contact page you have several options for the path:

Relative:

`&lt;a href=""contact.html""&gt;Contact page&lt;/a&gt;`

This tells the browser to look for a page named `contact.html` that is in the same folder as the `index.html` In this case, the folder is the root of your website

    - Root of your website
     -- index.html
     -- contact.html

You could also write the path as absolute:

`&lt;a href=""``http://www.example.com/contact.html``""&gt;Contact page&lt;/a&gt;`

The result will be the same, a major difference however, if you change domains, the first one will still work, the second one will not.

Let's say you change your domain to [`http://www.mysite.com`](http://www.mysite.com) the contact link will try to go to [`http://www.example.com/contact.html`](http://www.example.com/contact.html) which we can agree on is incorrect, right ? Therefore it's better to use the relative path.",1.0

fsj4i7i,gujabe,"The generic answer is that you'd use some back end programming language to add dynamic functionality to your site. The back end, in its most basic form, consists of a database and a programming language that you use to manipulate the data in the database, as well as to create any other necessary logic to drive your application. The term for this type of back end database manipulation is C.R.U.D (create, read, update, delete). The front end refers to the presentation of the data to the user, whether it's a browser or a mobile app.

The data can be served in several ways. You can use your back end programming language to format the data and construct an HTML document to be displayed by the browser. Alternatively, you can use your back end language to create an API (application programming interface) that will serve raw data. This data can be consumed by Javascript code on the front end and served in the browser, or used to serve other APIs.

There are what might be a daunting number of programming languages that can be used for back end development, including Javascript, and many developers struggle to choose which one they'd like to work with. That's unless, of course, they're either lucky or unlucky enough to have this dictated by the requirements of their job. Not even going to offer any advice on what language to choose, here. Think about what your requirements are, research the field, and form some conclusions. Would be glad to offer any advice in response to specific questions.

fsrqqng,guibdc,"Sorry got tied up and forgot to respond. At first glance I think there might be a problem with the space #home :hover should be #home:hover.
Also one thing to be aware of is specificity, you might have certain css overriding other properties due to this, research - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp

for example #nav #home {color: red} will override #home:hover {color: green} because it is more specific

Also word of advice, it seems like you use IDs a lot, I would recommend moving more towards classes and using ids sparingly, for example div id=""picture"" doesn't make sense, what if you want to add another picture? You should never have 2 elements with the same ID. Whereas div id=""landing-page-picture"" could make more sense to use id because there is likely only one of these elements. 
With classes you can make css properties more reusable, say you are assigning 20px margin to a lot of elements, well you could make a class .margin-20 and add that to elements instead of having to add margin: 20px to ever element in your css

If I understand correctly I can imagine some kind of text file, maybe csv that has columns listed, monday, tuesday, wednesday etc and then a section of rows listed. You would then need to arrange/ implement some logic to interpret this file into javascript variables. Then have logic which loops through these variables and builds the appropriate html table structure.

There's a lot of ways to go about it really, depends which rabbit hole you want to go down. If I was tasked with building this I would build it in react, have a public facing route where the table is displayed, read only and then build a dashboard where an admin could upload a csv or manually enter the data and save it to update the table. (this gives me a good idea for a side project)

A more simple route would be building something static with jquery, have a section within your javascript where the ""text"" data is hard coded and then manually change out the text when needed. The logic would be arranged to build the table based off the hard coded text.

Not sure if this helps or I'm way off, just bored on reddit. GL

frrfet2,gq93s8,"From what the other others have said but giving it a bit more context/backstory

So the 

    href

attribute is pointing to some resource outside of the html-document. 

I haven't seen the 

    download

attribute before, but it should download something when the user clicks according to [w3schools]( &lt;a href=""/images/myw3schoolsimage.jpg"" download&gt; )

The reason why it's customary to use relative paths is because the server that will host your website will most likely have a different path to your website related files than your working file-structure.

Therefore it's much better to ask for the css file that is in the directory relative to the current html-file.

    &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/filename.css""&gt;

The same goes for images.

    &lt;img src=""images/filename.png"" alt=""Text in case image fails to load"" title=""Text if the user hovers over the image""&gt;

If you are in www.mywebsite.com/page2 then you have to go ""down"" one step in order for you to access the file.
    
    &lt;img src=""../images/filename.png""&gt;

There's nothing wrong with with opening your file by double-clicking, but I would highly recommend that you use a webserver instead.

frogdh6,gpotua,"Well if you are only looking at a text magnifier, you could avoid the transform at all, and just manage the font size. transform can disrupt your document flow if unchecked.

    document.getElementById(""zoomIn"").addEventListener(""click"",function(){
      zoom += zoomStep; 
      var el = document.getElementById(""zoomtext"");

      var fontSize = parseFloat(style);

Style tags are used to define css and usually do not need an id tag for themselves.

But, ur JS seems to be trying to get this node via

fr9101g,gnal2y,"Repetition is key in my experience (that and the motivation to keep repeating).

How much time in a day/week do you have?

I’d start building websites without googling. Only use google at the beginning when you create a cheat sheet of important things you’re struggling to remember. Try to experiment with a new feature/idea at least once a week, but do something every day. Don’t forget to view your website in different browsers and resolutions (spotting issues will lead to more learning).

Consider creating a showcase website/blog that you review/maintain and add a feature to each week (even if the feature is just to modify positions a tiny bit). And host your other experiments somewhere to show of (each one should have the date, a brief description, and maybe the approximate amount of time spent on it). 

This will show your progression over time, and give you something to look back on and say “I did that.”

A lot of employers want people who don’t mind doing the same thing every day. Having a history of websites, even simple ones will give people a good idea of your strengths and that it’s not just a hobby for you. That and it will give you something to talk about each week.

Good luck!",2.0
frajmcw,gnal2y,"That's great advice. Thankyou.

I definitely need references open when I work and cobble things together.

My only real concern by working without a reference is how do I know if I'm actually building things ""right""?

For instance, I could use absolute positioning for something that could be done much simpler with an online style. (Literally had this happen the other day when placing some buttons)",1.0
freiwr7,gnal2y,"Building things ""right"" is often subjective to performance impact, readability, and maintainability. That's why I suggested having a website you maintain over a long period of time and make minor changes every week. Maybe once a quarter you could overhaul and rebuild the website from scratch.

Performance Impact: You can use online resources to audit your website and look for common mistakes (ex: image size being too large for their configured size). If you're hosting your website online, consider running it through [seoptimer.com](https://seoptimer.com), [website.grader.com](https://website.grader.com) (email is optional), or [woorank.com/](https://woorank.com/)

Readability/maintainability: As long as you can go through a website you haven't worked on in weeks and understand your code you're on the right track. Consider working on other people's websites and see if you can make changes to it by reading the code (some websites hide the classes/comments using minification, these are still good websites to play with).

Having notes is great, and I can't imagine working in an environment without access to Google, MDN, and StackOverflow (not to mention all my personal notes and pre-built code). However I think it's important to memorize some of the key concepts rather than relying on external resources (can lead to spaghetti code).

Don't get me wrong, I hate rogue memorization. The hardest classes I ever took were with professors who seemed to have a photographic memory and expected you to take a test without notes (the webpage/code had to compile without errors, even an incorrect uppercase was flagged and penalized).

fr6j8y7,gmovde,"Wordpress is in a completely different category than Wix and Weebly.  Unlike the other two, it's completely customizable and allows you to hook into the source rather than what the page builder exposes.  It's also extensively customizable through a robust plugin system.

While it does have a page builder (multiple, actually), it's not primarily a WYSIWYG product but rather a PHP based CMS that includes a WYSIWYG that some people use and some people don't.

Moreover, Wordpress is completely free and not a SASS product like the other two.  You can have it on your own domain for free as well and you can install it on whatever host you want.  It's also not primarily an e-commerce platform like the other two, but rather can be used as one if you install WooCommerce.  WooCommerce, like Wordpress, is also insanely customizable and in a totally different league than Wix and Weebly.

When you build a custom Wordpress theme, you have all the same freedom of a full stack application because it is a full stack application.  That is, you build WP themes with CSS/HTML/JS/MySql/PHP just as you might if you weren't using Wordpress.  

What Wordpress offers is functionality out of the box to manage and present content in a very streamline fashion without having to manually setup a DB or write  functions common to most non-static sites.  How simple or complex you want to make that is completely up to you, and that's why it can cost $2k-$100k for a business to get a Wordpress site developed. 

This is not to say that it's the best solution to every problem.  Wordpress with WooCommerce is a great choice, for example, for an e-commerce site, but it's not the best solution to enterprise level applications.   For that you would be better off starting with a framework like Symfony or even something built with Java.  It's great for a marketing page that shows off your company, but it would not be great to try and build a Reddit clone on it.  Etc.",1.0
fr6k7j6,gmovde,[deleted],1.0
fr6p3ri,gmovde,"&gt; ""I should code this from scratch"".

I disagree.  Perhaps there would have been better options than Wordpress, but you as a single coder are not going to be able to build a better and more secure wheel than the frameworks that have benefited from tens of thousands of eyes over many years, all working together to build a more secure product.

Chances are better than not that you would overlook security features that you can take for granted in modern frameworks out of the box.  There's virtually no benefit to not utilizing the various Symfony components for database connections, for example, because their components are top notch.  If you were to start fresh and design something robust, secure, and elegantly coded to OOP standards, you would basically design Symfony, and so not using it would be a waste of time. 

On top of that, no reasonably complex system is realistically maintainable by a single person.  Most of the major web frameworks are open source and have teams of people constantly working on new features and better security.  Those that are commercial closed source at the very least have professional teams maintaining their code bases.

Additionally, the extensibility of the various frameworks and integration into modern IDEs make them incomparable to custom solutions.  PHPStorm, for example, understands Symfony scaffolding and can navigate the code base without doing more than installing a plugin.  If you built something custom, you would be forced to either forego a lot of modern IDE features, or you'd have to spend time building a plugin.

Lastly, Wordpress aside, modern PHP frameworks like Symfony are incredibly elegant.  If you can make something better, you should, but I'm not sure how you would even improve in a way that Symfony (or Laravel etc.) isn't already working on.

&gt; It was much better than Shopify across the board. 

Yes, Shopify is horrible.

&gt;It would have been faster

Than Wordpress?  Very possible, as Wordpress is fairly old and come with bloat.  But other modern frameworks are very fast.  

&gt; and more flexible.

Possibly?  But Wordpress has one of the most flexible plugin systems on the market.  You can basically hook into virtually anything you want without touching the WP core.

&gt;I was hoping to give OP a simple argument for still learning HTML and CSS

Wordpress or not, if you want to build serious websites you have to know how to code.  But there is plenty of space for WP in the webdev market.  I would say WP sites account for approximately 30% of my firm's clients, and all custom, no WYSIWYG.

&gt; but ultimately one would be better off simply learning the fundamentals that run the web.

This isn't an either-or.  If you want to do WP development you have to know full stack development.  If you want to do a WP blog you don't need it, but for anything more than that, WP is just serving as a base on which you build a custom coded solution.",0.0

This is correct, although I'd generally avoid using IDs *for styling*, as an ID-selector is 10x more [specific](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) than a class-selector. It's generally best to aim for low specificity, as they're a lot easier to override later.

Now your ID selector rule is useless, and because it might rely on the super-high specificity, converting it to a class selector might no longer yield the results you expect, without revisiting the other styles that might affect it.

Why would you prefer ""hard to override"" to ""just specific enough that a rule gets applied""? Sure, there are special cases, like CMS plugins that are meant to work anywhere, regardless of other styles on the page.

It doesn't matter if they're repeated across the site, so long as it's once per page.

&gt; Why would you prefer ""hard to override"" to ""just specific enough that a rule gets applied""?

Two reasons for me.

Semantics: a unique element should have a unique selector. Yes, that can be done with classes, but that feels like an abuse of the intended use.

Practicality: I'll want an id for JS anyway, why give it a class and an id? If I have some common styles for all games, then sure, but that's not always the case with unique elements.

&gt; not a good general guideline.

Never intended as a guideline, and I'm not saying to use id willy-nilly. It has a specific use case, and should be limited to that. But ""never use ids in CSS"" seems a bit extreme, just like ""never use tables"". Tables have a specific use case too, and it should be ""never use tables for layout"".",1.0
frd8t32,glyteh,"&gt; But ""never use ids in CSS"" seems a bit extreme

Agreed, and I never claimed anything like that. My point explicitly concerned general guidelines, not absolute rules to apply everywhere.

&gt; Now I want #dragon-hunter-canvas and #block-puzzle-canvas

Right, but now the existing ```#game-canvas { ... }``` in your CSS does nothing. You have to keep adding IDs to the selector, then overriding them afterwards. I would rather have one class that does the heavy lifting for all game-canvases, for example:

    .game-canvas {
        background-color: black;
        image-rendering: pixelated;
        height: 0;
        padding-bottom: calc(100% * 9 / 16);
    }

And when a new game comes in, with a square aspect ratio, instead of the default 16:9:

    .game-canvas.game-canvas--square {
        padding-bottom: 100%;
    }

But perhaps one of the games has a transparent background, and _it_ needs a specific background color:

    #dragon-hunter {
        background-color: #6e2;
    }

This puts the ""Cascading"" in CSS :)",1.0
frderav,glyteh,"I think we're pretty much agreed then. I guess I jumped the gun. ""don't use ids in CSS"" is something I've heard a fair amount, and the specificity argument never made much sense to me.",1.0
fr122at,glyteh,"Like mentioned, ID's are unique. This means an ID can only be used once on a page. The difference also lies in importance. I'd generally use classes for styling, this is also because they can be reused. Let's say you'd have a menu with a couple `&lt;a&gt;` tags inside. You'd be able to give the same class to every single `&lt;a&gt;` tag, so that whichever styling you put on that class, it can be used for every `&lt;a&gt;` tag.

For a menu you'd have something like this:

```html
&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=""/"" class=""menu-link""&gt;Hello World&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=""/page"" class=""menu-link""&gt;Hello Space&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
```

You wouldn't be able to use an ID on the `&lt;a&gt;`, as you've got multiple of them. I'd say always avoid adding styles to an ID as most of the time you'll be using it for functionality reasons in combination with JavaScript.

Another reason you could see an ID in an `&lt;a&gt;` tag is because you can use it to quickly move to a specific element with an ID (I hope this isn't confusing). The browser reads all ID's and you can use them to navigate to with an `&lt;a&gt;` tag, like so:

```html
&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=""#unique-id"" class=""menu-link""&gt;Hello World&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=""/page"" class=""menu-link""&gt;Hello Space&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;div id=""unique-id""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

If you click on the Hello World link, the browser will instantly move the location of your window to the top of that `&lt;div&gt;`.

Other than that, never use ID's. They're just teaching you the concept of an ID. The actual real-world use case is always different.

The problem is that the creator of the theme is changing both the hight and the width of the image; usually you'll want to define a height *or* width and set the the other to `auto`.  If you set them both then the image will skew.

What `object-fit: contain` does is fits the image's natural aspect-ratio into the defined space as much as it can without cropping anything off. An alternative is `object-fit: cover` \- which will fill the image into the defined space, and allow for parts of it to be cropped-off.

Your final option would be, instead of changing the object-fit, to just override the height reisze and say:

    img { height: auto }

fqesv24,gi7tb2,"Tried `CSS.supports(""pointer-events"", ""bounding-box"")` in web console and returned false. I don't think Firefox supports `pointer-events: bounding-box` yet.

I am assuming you are wanting to make a rectangular region inside the SVG a clickable link without affecting entire SVG. Here's my solution:

**Adding** an invisible `&lt;rect&gt;` or similar **inside** `&lt;a&gt;`, using `opacity` to hide it. Be sure to sets its dimensions. This should make it clickable. Do **not** set `fill` to `none` to hide it, as would effect clicking. `opacity` is used for hiding. Basically, the purpose of the hidden extra shape using `opacity: 0` is to represent a clickable region. You can use any shape element such as `&lt;path&gt;` instead if you do not want to be limited to rectangular region.

Example using path:

    &lt;a xlink:href=""#""&gt;
    &lt;path d=""""&gt;&lt;!-- visible icon --&gt;
    &lt;path d="""" opacity=""0""&gt;&lt;!-- entire clickable region, shape is hidden --&gt;

fqak8n7,ghsm15,I would suggest to close all tags since it is less confusing. But the trailing / is optional if that was your question.,1.0
fqdqu10,ghsm15,"So self-closing tags are supposed to be used when there is no content within the tags themselves. For example, &lt;input&gt; can be self closing since you can include all relevant information about the tag via its properties. Therefore, you don’t need to put anything inside the tag itself, meaning it can be self closing. Just like the &lt;img&gt; tag. 

When using a self-closing tag, the proper syntax is &lt;img src=“url/to/image” /&gt;. You place the closing forward-slash next to the “&gt;” in the starting tag.

If it is not a self-closing element, you use the normal syntax: &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;.

Hope that helps. Good luck.",1.0

I started in Sigil and created a new epub structure in there. I copied the html code for the actual chapters of the books into the body of the generated ""Section0001.xhtml"". Sigil has functionality to split the xhtml file at the point where the cursor is in the code, so i did this at each chapter. I then generated a table of contents using the sigil functionality, that builds this from your chapter headings eg. &lt;h2 id=""ch3""&gt;Chapter Three&lt;/h2&gt;, i then manually removed the &lt;h3&gt; generated in the table of contents.

Im afraid I don't know why the toc are not showing in apple books, it shows fine for me in my epub application on my phone(android).

FYI, if you have Calibre working. Open the calibre application and add the epub to your library, highlight the book and then on the menu bar there is an option to ""Edit Book"", this will give you all the functionality that sigil offers in terms of editing a book and will let you see the epub structure.

Let me know if you are struggling, I would be willing to do all of this for you if you are happy to send me the text of the book or the html code if you have it. :) If you want to do that I could have it for you by the end of the day. Drop me a direct message if you want me to do this.",1.0

fq0eqs8,ggf36i,"Two things:

1. HTML attributes need to be surrounded with `""` marks - so `&lt;table border=2&gt;` won't work, you'll need `&lt;table border=""2""&gt;` \- this is causing the error that's stopping most of your page from rendering.
2. `&lt;hr&gt;` and `&lt;font&gt;` shouldn't be used anymore - the role of HTML is to *describe* its contents, not to *style* them - if you'd like to change the apperance of something then it's better to either:
   1. use the `&lt;style&gt;` tag and place your CSS inside there
   2. use the `&lt;link&gt;` tag and point to a `.css` file.

The good news is that CSS is a LOT easier to write than inline styles in your HTML, so once you understand the basics of how to use it, your life is going to get much more pleasant.

fq0ptga,ggf36i,"[MAXIMUM EFFORT!](https://codepen.io/SilentDis/pen/wvKjKKm)

Notes about my implmentation:

* `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;` \- Should be on every HTML document. So much is processed by bots now, that not having this hurts you a lot, silently. Top of every page you make. Period.
* Close All Tags - I see a ton of disagreement with this, and it's perfectly valid. It's not required as part of HTML5 spec. But, I find myself swapping between HTML and XML so frequently, some consistency between the two is welcome, this is to make my life easier. You do you, I'll close everything. `&lt;img /&gt;` `&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;link /&gt;`
* Spacing - This is for readability. You'll develop your own flow over time on what/how to space out your HTML, but I like the 'blocks' that you see here.
* External Stylesheet - This makes it easier to pull into every page I make, lending to site consistency. I don't want to have to repeat that, and I want it to be global for the whole site. One change, and it changes site-wide.
* `:root` \- I'm using that color in 2 elements, so I am using :root (the beginning of everything in CSS, basically) to define some CSS variables that I'll reuse.
* `--main-color:` \- This is a CSS variable. Lets me define the styling in one place, and reuse it in my CSS code. In this case, the text color and the horizontal rule. I call it with `var(--main-color)` in my CSS.
* `&lt;div class=""pica""&gt; &lt;/div&gt;` \- It looked like you were trying to make this sort of a 'menu' on the right. So, I encased all the code you had, and floated it to the right using this `&lt;div&gt;` tag set. I gave it a `class`, so I could more easily reference just it in my CSS.
* `&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;` \- Again, style preference here. I use `&lt;thead&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;` and `&lt;tfoot&gt; &lt;/tfoot&gt;` so I can add headers, footers, and body in my tables, all with different styling. Not required, purely consistency for me.
* `.pica &lt;element&gt;` \- I only want to style the stuff inside that div I gave the class pica. I want to have the option to style other stuff on the page differently. So, I'm cascading here; calling that class, then elements under it.
* General standardization - You had used a lot of non-standard calls, such as `size`. These are seriously depreciated at this point in HTML5. The trend tends to be to ""say what you mean""; basically, rather than arbitrary relative sizes based on the browser's choice, you make the choice, then the browser adapts to that. It's your page, the browser just renders it, you should be in control.
* Quotes - In HTML, you should have quotes everywhere. Without them, some browsers (I'm looking at you, Safari) have no clue (or are purposely obstinate) and won't render stuff. If they ""look messy"", I get you; that's why you break out to a separate stylesheet and space things.

Give a shout if you have questions about this implementation, I'm happy to answer! The 'big liberty' I took was encasing it in the div set; I'm not 100% sure what you were going for in that regard, so I had to guess at purpose. This may not 'work' for what you're trying to do, and need a rework because of that :)

NINJA EDIT:

One other thing; tables should be for tabular data... only. Again, people disagree on this and for small implementations like this, it's fine. I prefer [flexboxes](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) simply because I'm in the mindset of reactive pages that auto-scale everything based on screen real-estate.

fpsntnf,gfbbm2,"Okay, so first your home page will have to be named index.html. For the other pages, you can name them whatever, as long as it ends with .html . There should be some kind of way to create a new file of some kind in whatever you're making your website with. This will create a new file. All the files for your web page have to be stored in the same folder.

If you already have buttons of some kind and you want them to redirect to a new page, you should be able to do that with image mapping. If you have a button that you want to redirect to a certain page, then map the image so when the user clicks on that part of the image, it will send them to that specific link. 

If you don't have buttons yet, and you don't want to use image mapping, then you can do that with some CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. First, you can either have the css in the html document in some &lt;style&gt; tags. You can also create a CSS file by naming your new file with .css at the end, and just put &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""nameofstylesheet.css""&gt; in the head tags of your webpage. Instead of nameofstylesheet.css, you'd put whatever you name your stylesheet (your new css file.

So, there's two parts to this. First you'll want to put this code:

&lt;ul&gt;  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""index.html""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""webpage1.html""&gt;Page1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""webpage2.html""&gt;Page2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""webpage3.html""&gt;Page3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;/ul&gt;

Into the HTML of all your webpages. This will put the links into your webpage. You can change the links it links to, and the text that button will display.

Next, to make it look nice, you need to put this:

ul {  
  list-style-type: none;  
  margin: 0;  
  padding: 0;  
  overflow: hidden;  
  background-color: #333;  
}  


li {  
  float: left;  
}  


li a {  
  display: block;  
  color: white;  
  text-align: center;  
  padding: 14px 16px;  
  text-decoration: none;  
}

Into your CSS document. You can play around with other things such as the font, colour, and other things by changing the settings here. It's also possible to add an image instead of a background colour too.

fpqakti,gewzcb,"The problem with a question like this is that it's a bit like saying, ""hey, I really want to open a kiosk inside a mall--does anyone know how to do that?""

It's a big project with many different viable approaches that could work depending on your strengths as a developer. It could be built as a WordPress plugin using PHP combined with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It could be developed as a standalone PHP application using the same technologies and a simple iframe embed to plug it into WordPress. It could be developed as a JAM stack application using a custom NodeJS backend or any number of CMSaaS platforms plus an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend using Vue, React, Svelte, Angular, or even just vanilla JS.

There are a lot of considerations to take into account when planning a project like this, most of which come down to defining user stories that can be translated into technical requirements and broken into small tasks to be completed in an Agile or Waterfall type of software development work flow.

Unfortunately, it's not as simple as just linking you to a free tutorial on YouTube or pointing to a step-by-step tutorial on a blog.",2.0
fpqfd36,gewzcb,"Hahaha I had a feeling it wouldn’t be that easy. Most of those words sadly went over my head. I’m barely able to do HTML, if that. So I know o have a long ways to go just to understand what’s in the code. I found somewhat of a tutorial to set it up.

I’m assuming that hard part is embedding in the page. I see what you mean with so many options. I was hoping to have an embed code to just plug into a text spot on the page, but I’m a novice so I’m sure I’m making a wish that can’t come true the way I’m hoping.

fpqqpws,gewzcb,"Sorry if it came off as harsh, I hate to take the wind out of your sails. It does sound like a really fun idea and I think people would really like it. I grew up on Choose Your Own Adventure books and I miss them. In fact, I've been tinkering around with a web-based text adventure engine for a platform other than WordPress since the start of quarantine.

Actually, embedding in the page is the easy part, depending on how you want to do it. WordPress has widgets that can be placed in the sidebar and footer and other places. You can place an embed code or an iframe in the widget pretty easily.

If you want to create an embed code like a WordPress shortcode then I would suggest looking at how to create a WordPress plugin. Best of luck!",1.0
fpqyqo6,gewzcb,"That actually didn’t feel harsh. You gave me a list of options, all of which I have little experience to understand, but they were all viable routes for me to look into. I feel like the tutorial I found might help me complete the task of creating what I’m looking for.

Once I get the experience of writing HTML, CSS, and JS I’ll have so much more ability to put it together. But these sails are self blowing. I have a lot of energy and determination and motivation to learn. Have to if I want to make this story helper for my site.

In my head, I see the two pieces that are most important are the program for the CYOA and the embedding into the site. If I can understand those, then I think I have it made. Thank you for your advice, again. And for being nice.

fpddrpq,gcsqzz,"I'd recommend getting as recent a book as you can find. There are a LOT of new things since HTML5 and CSS3 became a thing, and it was almost a decade ago now. There are *many* techniques that were commonly taught 10 years ago that now are done in much simpler and more performant ways. While you can certainly learn a lot from an old book, a web development book that is 10+ years old will cause you to learn a lot that you will then have to unlearn. A great beginner book with high quality color pictures is ""HTML &amp; CSS - Design and Build Websites"" by Jon Ducket.  You also would do well with ""Beginning Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3"" by Jonathon Fielding from Apress or  ""The Modern Web"" by Kovid Goyal.

You could also look and see if the publisher of your current book allows for digital copies of newer editions to people with older copies. Most popular web programming books get updated several times as the tech changes, and some will let owners of past version get a .PDF or .EPUB file of the new one. There are also many development books that are available for free on the web.

If you have not found it yet, you should also familiarize yourself with the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) webdocs found at  [https://developer.mozilla.org/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) . They are an incredibly valuable resource for documentation on web technologies like HTML &amp; CSS (but others too) and also have a lot of great tutorials you can go through.

If you can't/don't want to: Make sure to keep an eye on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to see which tags are obsolete.

You could also keep an eye on the [HTML Specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/) - the WHATWG was founded by Apple, Mozilla and Opera back in the day because Microsoft was keeping everything held back. Nowadays the WHATWG has taken over the task of defining HTML from the W3C (they still define CSS though).

Note that not everything in the HTML spec has been implemented, but you can also look at their HTML (`ctrl+u` to see the HTML source) for examples.

PS: Reading through the spec can be somewhat boring, so having a [Read Aloud: A Text to Speech Voice Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp) or [Natural Reader Text to Speech

fp5yyt1,gbipop,"I don't have any recommendations of resources, but your things to master is a little confused.

- HTML+CSS is basically one thing - you'll need them both to do anything worthwhile
- JavaScript will be the next thing you should learn, as that's how you add functionality to websites (more than just forms)
- Don't worry about jQuery (or any other library or framework, really - SASS, LESS, Bootstrap, Symphony, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), as a professional developer I haven't used jQuery directly in years. Libraries are useful tools but if you understand the underlying technology then they're trivial to learn so don't put effort into learning one until you know it's what you need and understand the problem it's solving.
- SQL is important, but all the implementations are similar so at first it really won't matter which version you're using.
- Learning NoSQL-based databases is also good to have but it's basically just understanding JSON + using a library so again it's more important to understand the language you're writing rather than the library syntax.
- Learning PHP is only useful if that's the kind of work you do.  I learned PHP like 20 years ago but haven't used it in over a decade because it isn't in demand for the kind of work I do.
- Since you'll already know JavaScript by now it'd be better to start into backend programming with Node than PHP or Python.
- Learn git basics before you start anything backend-related.",12.0

fp62rze,gbipop,"Don’t waste time on JQuery. If you know Javascript well enough, when you do come across some JQuery you’ll be able to hop in and make sense of it.

Word of advice from someone who is self taught and got a job in the industry: get really good at Javascript and then branch out into React, Angular, etc. If you want to find a job, it really helps to have a modern framework down. For instance, I learned React and NodeJS to get a job in my area because React jobs are plentiful. IMO you should learn a stack based on your job market. No reason to learn something you won’t be able to find a job for. If most jobs in your area are React, learn React. Goes for anything. This broadens your job pool and makes you more attractive. I got my first job based on my React projects and knowledge of JS. 

HTML and CSS are honestly secondary to web programming when it comes to Javascript. You really need to know them, but don’t spend months on end with HTML and CSS. A month or so is enough time to understand both and to be able to work with them. Learn what semantic HTML is and why you need it, learn Flexbox and CSS grid. No need to play around with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. If you know CSS, you can hop right into the docs for frameworks like that and understand what to do. 

If your goal is to just work in a WordPress shop, you can get by with little knowledge of JS. I find in my area at least, those jobs pay peanuts compared to actual Javascript work. 

Of course Javascript isn’t the only language, you can get good at PHP for example and make a career with that. I know only the basics of PHP so I can’t really help you there. I hardly ever need to use it unless I’m farting around on a WordPress site.",5.0

fp7fgzp,gbipop,"CMS is short for content management system. If you have more complex websites, or the client want to be able to change things themselves, it's pretty handy. Most CMS are programmed with serverside php and store content in sql databases. The user doesn't have much contact with the php and sql. From the content in the sql the php generates the website, so you have a easy way to create large websites, do changed and try out different layouts. For more complex changes you should learn html and css, even a bit php and js is pretty handy sometimes. 

I would recommend you to learn wordpress, it's the largest CMS out there and nearly a third of the web uses it. It's pretty easy to use, pretty flexible and there are many plugins and themes.

CSS styles apply top down, so since all 4 styles are for the same class named box, the last one applies in the end, and overrides each and every one of the definitions above it.

You can fix this like so;

    .topnav {

        background-color: white;
        margin-top: 0;
        text-align: center;

        color: black;
        /*removed text-align-center*/
        padding: 10px 30px;
    }

You'll notice this will also fix the way the nav menu sits on Mobile.

The reason I removed ``text-align: center;`` on your ``.topnav a`` class is because text-center was being applied by your ``.description_small`` class anyways.

As for your images and text boxes, the reason they appear in odd order is because you have to remember that on a small screen your columns are going to stack on top of each other in a left to right format. The left most column will stack on top of the right most column. There is a way to fix this using FLEX and ORDER values; it'd require a bit of a rework, unless someone else might know an easier way to help you but here's a demonstration;

fouofme,g9e62h,"**tl;dr:** by default, most html editors won't recognize your paragraph breaks without \&lt;p&gt;

Biggy backing off this comment to add: html, by default, conbines any amount of spaces, or return lines, into single space. So this:


**First line.**

**Second line.**


Turns into this when rendered from an editor:


**First line. Second line.**


You could add 1 million spaces between words, or a hundred line returns, and html would still read it as a single space.

\&lt;p&gt; tags help the system to know when you'd like to treat groups of text like paragraphs, and where those paragraphs begin and end; the style of these paragraphs can, of course, be altered in your CSS.

so this:

**\&lt;p&gt;First line.\&lt;/p&gt;**
**\&lt;p&gt;Second line.\&lt;/p&gt;**

Will render how you want: as two separate paragraphs, instead of two consecutive sentences:


**First line.**

**Second line.**


Some html editors in a CMS, such as WordPress, recognize and respect line returns, making the use of  \&lt;p&gt; tags almost obsolete, except in cases where you want to in-line adjust some text-specific styles, such as line height or font family.

But by default, html won't recognize your paragraph breaks without \&lt;p&gt;. ~~(or, I guess, withthout an excessive use of \&lt;br /&gt;)~~

fowje7n,g9e62h,Oh shit. This makes a lot of sense thanks. I didn't know that,2.0
fowlvqi,g9e62h,"You're welcome!

To further answer your question, \\&lt;a&gt; tags, or ""anchor"" tags are specific to formatting links, and can also be styled inline (as can any tag), or from the CSS. In most cases, you do not want a block of text to be handled by the style of your \\&lt;a&gt;, only the link itself ;)

Plus, to give a second to the poor redditor whose comment I hijacked, \\&lt;div&gt; tags are basically big blank slates. Like \\&lt;p&gt; they're meant to contain content, but unlike \\&lt;p&gt;, they rarely have any innate CSS coding, so you can use them to easily inline style blocks of content without CSS baggage, or you can pre-code classes in your CSS to easily affect blocks of content without having to wrestle with current styles on other tags. 

For learning HTML, I also highly recommend [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/). It's the website I used to learn, and they have areas in each section where you can play around in an editor with code already imputed that showcases the ""lesson"". It's a good way to play around, break stuff, and learn.",1.0

You have to understand that an ``&lt;a&gt;`` is not a ``&lt;p&gt;`` so they behave differently. A ``&lt;p&gt;`` will always behave like a paragraph no matter where you put it. ``&lt;a&gt;`` is simply for making links or something clickable.

fotjlgd,g9e62h,"HTML is a markup language. The tags are intended to actually tag the text that they surround to indicate to a reader (a software reader like a web browser) what the text represents. For example, a p tag represents a paragraph. An a tag represents an anchor, most notably used as hypertext links. Recently, with the advent of HTML 5, there has been a push for more semantic tag names and away from the vague and extremely overused div (division) and span (an inline wrapper which spans the text it contains, not descriptive of the content in the slightest). Now we have article and section and many, many more.

foof6n5,g8kdli,"Question: 

How would they lock down the videos if they didn't want people to download them?",1.0
fooi6zo,g8kdli,"They could attempt to make sure that the file is being called from a website, and not directly at it's own URL, but that can be circumvented in a few ways. 

They could also use some scripting to stream the video in chunks instead of as a whole file, but most sites don't go that route since problems with the script would bring all their videos down (or if people have JavaScript off or are using an older browser, etc).",3.0
foowr2a,g8kdli,"You're getting half answers that are technically true. Imma slam you with a bit of an information overload to add some technical perspective and background to fill in the nuance. The TL;DR is that no one will know you saved the videos using the method you outlined. That's technically true, but not a guarantee and not the whole story.

I want to talk about the word *download*. There's a technical meaning, and a common usage meaning. The common usage meaning for downloading is that you are **saving** something. If someone asks you to download something, they are asking you to save that something to your computer. Technically a download is any time a client (your web browser) requests a resource (the video) from a server (the website). When you are viewing the video on the website, your browser is still downloading the video, displaying it inside the browser, and then throwing it away. 

On the webpage itself, when you say the videos are embedded, that's some code to your browser instructing it to get a file, and play it. A 'download button' is some code to your browser instructing your browser to get a file, and save it. When you are going to the MP4 directly, you are instructing your browser to get the file, and the browser doesn't have a default, so it asks you what you want it to do, and you're saving it. As far as the website can tell, you made a request to get a file, and the website can't tell whether the browser played it and discarded it after, or if the browser saved the file.

So, the website can't tell. But, people aren't stupid. Websites keep logs. A normal usage pattern is going to the page url, and .2 seconds later requesting a video. That's a person who is viewing the video directly on the web page. You are viewing the video, .2 seconds later requesting the video, and then 6 seconds later requesting the video by itself. Someone knowledgeable looking at those logs will know what you're doing.

Further, a web request will include some meta data, in this case in the form of http headers. One of these is called a referrer, which your browser will supply. A referrer is the web page you are coming from, before requesting the new resource. Basically, if you click a link on reddit, your browser will follow the link, and tell the new website ""hey, I'm coming from reddit!"". However, if you just copy + paste the link, there is no referrer. So, in your case, loading the embedded video will provide a referrer. Accessing it directly will not provide one. Again, anyone knowledgeable will know what you're doing. You can write code or use an extension or whatever to directly go to a link *and* provide a referrer, but again, the access pattern is a better tell.

A browser extension, or code to emulate browser behavior would be completely undetectable. That's because again, your browser already has to download the mp4 to play it, so that access pattern already exists. That's a bit out of scope here, though. By doing what you're outlining, no one is going to find out. Even if someone notices you're access pattern, that's not a guarantee that you ever saved them, you could have just as easily viewed the video through the browser using the direct link, too.",1.0
foo39tq,g8kdli,"No I think it's comparable to copying an image from a website. It is basically the same with the video's. You have the code sent to you. The user can look at the HTML file if they want. Basically you already have the source of the video, because it's linked.",1.0

So, if you were to have the following markup, noting that I've created a `&lt;p&gt;` tag for the sake of showing you the image is being applied to the background and that there is content inside, your HTML could look as follows...


```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        body {
            background-image: url('https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vg8jw.jpg');
        
            background-position: center;
            background-size: cover;
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
        
            height: 100vh;
        
            color: #fff;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eligendi mollitia, deleniti saepe odio illum maxime? Possimus, optio omnis explicabo quaerat molestias quos iure voluptas veritatis aut sequi quis vero? Quae distinctio officiis tenetur cupiditate perspiciatis, nihil illo ex nesciunt recusandae quos iusto porro ipsum rem impedit unde ut natus voluptate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

In addition to the `background-image` CSS style rule, I've added `background-position: center` which will make sure it is... well... centered, I've added `background-size: cover` which will make the image stretch to fill the size of the element the background image is being applied to (in this case `&lt;body&gt;`) and I've added `background-repeat: no-repeat` as otherwise the image isn't big enough to fill the entire element so it will keep repeating the image in the background, background repeat ensuring that there aren't duplicates of the same image.

Additionally I've changed the `height` property to `100vh` (100% of view height) to fill the entire window but you would normally just allow the content within `&lt;body&gt;` to stretch it out and not give body a height as it should be governed by the height of its contents.

Finally, I added `color: #fff` which will change the text color of all children nested within `&lt;body&gt;` (in this case the `&lt;p&gt;` tag) to white.

CSS is a whole other beast on its own so you might want to look into it to get a better understanding of styling on web pages.

foiqp6v,g7ez62,"Because of the way you used floats and `position: relative;` to lay out your page, your page content actually has content boxes that extend to the left edge of the page, over top of the table of contents because of z-index. This is ""blocking"" the anchor elements from registering pointer events. Some of the links actually worked because you got lucky and they were underneath the margin of the content boxes, which doesn't ""block"" pointer events, whereas the broken links were under the content box itself.

The quick and dirty fix is to add `position: relative;` and `z-index: 999;` to your #table-of-contents css.

The real fix is to use flexbox instead of floats and relative positioning, along with fixing problems with your html such as putting your table of contents inside of an H1.",1.0

Do mobile first on your next projects. It's easier to go from small to large screen sizes.

I checked your website real quick and I saw you used a tags for the footer. However those aren't links so you should use p tags instead.

As for the form, the subscribe could be a hX tag where x is a number between 1 and 6. The other p should be a label.

Use margin or padding instead of adding lots of line breaks and add alt=""""Some image short description"" for all your images. Your .topnav should be a nav instead of a div

I also suggest you start using rems for font-size and ems for margin and padding",2.0

What that div will be is your container, when you apply a width or padding to it you will reveal the body behind it where your background is.

Apply this class;

    .container {
      margin-top: 100px;
      margin-left: 150px;
      margin-right: 150px;
      margin-bottom: 100px;
      padding-top: 50px;
      padding-left: 50px;
      padding-right: 50px;
      padding-bottom: 50px;
      background: #fff;
    }

And this might be enough for you to figure out the rest. I've used very basic CSS so that you might be able to figure it out. Play with the values etc and see what happens.

fo7ad0i,g5w435,"That is not a viable strategy for working code.

You've copied JS and CSS that targets links, yet there are no links in your HTML. The part that's supposed to toggle the grayscale effect, targets the `filtered` class, but your CSS only has a `grayscale` class.

Here's how to pull it off, starting with a bare-bones HTML document:

    &lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt; Page title goes here &lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;

        Page content goes here

      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

For the content, you wanted images. An absolute minimum for image tags looks like this:

    &lt;img alt=""Description of the image""
         src=""http://example.com/image.jpg"" /&gt;

You will want to put it between the `&lt;body&gt;` and `&lt;/body&gt;` tags in the HTML. But don't do that yet, because there's one other thing we'll need for this particular feature; a class name. A class name is an arbitrary name you can give an element, to distinguish it from other elements. It does nothing by itself, but you will want to use it when you have CSS or JavaScript. Let's say we want to call your image `grayscale`;

    &lt;img class=""grayscale""
         alt=""New England Patriots logo""
         src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/New_England_Patriots_logo.svg"" /&gt;

An element can have multiple different class names, and that is what we'll do to actually apply the grayscale effect via CSS. Let's say we want the grayscaling to be active when an element with the class `grayscale` **also** has the class `active`:

    .grayscale.active {
      filter: grayscale(100%);
    }

The first part here is called a *selector*. It's used to select the elements to which a given set of styling will be applied. The styling rules are what's between the `{` and `}`. In this case we only have one rule, `filter`, but multiple rules can be placed within the same *block*.

Note that the above is CSS, not HTML, so we'll have to include it in our HTML document by using the `&lt;style&gt;` tag, and placing it between the `&lt;head&gt;` and `&lt;/head&gt;` tags of our HTML, like so:

    &lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt; Page title goes here &lt;/title&gt;
        
        &lt;style&gt;
          .grayscale.active {
            filter: grayscale(100%);
          }
        &lt;/style&gt;
        
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;

        &lt;img class=""grayscale""
             alt=""New England Patriots logo""
             src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/New_England_Patriots_logo.svg"" /&gt;

      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

If you look at the page at it's current state, the image will not yet have the grayscale effect activated, because our image doesn't have the `active` class. For that we'll need some JavaScript, which is probably the hardest part, unless you have some experience in another programming language. The objective is to be able to click any element (image or otherwise) that has the class `grayscale` and make it also have the class `active` if it doesn't, but remove it if it does. I'll just go through this line by line:

    const images = document.querySelectorAll('.grayscale');

First we must prepare by selecting the element(s) we want. `'.grayscale'` is what we had earlier in the CSS, and we're passing it to a built-in function `document.querySelectorAll()`. This will give us a list of all the elements within our document, that match the selector we gave it. We store this list to a *variable* called ""images"" (arbitrary name) for later use.

Next, we'll want to do the same operation for all the images we found in the previous step. For this, we can use a `.forEach` function, that is available for arrays and most other types of lists:

    images.forEach(image =&gt; {
      // rest of the code goes here
    });

Here I've placed a *comment* into the code, by prepending it with two slashes. It will be ignored by the browser, but it can be helpful to add notes for yourself, to remind what's supposed to be going on. Moving on...

    image.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
      // continue here..
    });

Most interactive things within a web page utilize *events*. Click something on a page, and the browser will fire an event to the element that was clicked. Move your mouse, and again the browser will fire events to the element beneath your cursor. To make use of these events, we must first tell the browser we want to *listen* to a certain type of event. For this, we're using the built-in `.addEventListener` function within the context of a single image (remember, we're now looping through each individual image within our list of images). We want to capture clicks, hence `'click'`. Next comes our actual listener function, that will execute whenever a `click` event is fired on our image.

Okay, so now we have selected all the elements with a 'grayscale' class name and added an event listener for each of them. What's left is the code that will toggle the `active` class I mentioned earlier:

    image.classList.toggle('active');

Perhaps you can guess what this does.. Yes, it will add the class name `active` if the element doesn't already have it, and it will remove the class name otherwise. That should be it, so let's recap all the JavaScript:

    // Select all elements with the class name ""grayscale""
    const images = document.querySelectorAll('.grayscale');

    // Loop through each selected element...
    images.forEach(image =&gt; {

      // Start listening for cursor clicks...
      image.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {

        // Toggle the clicked element's effect
        image.classList.toggle('active');
      });

    });

Makes sense, yes? Also, pay very close attention to punctuation. Just one missing brace or quotation mark will likely stop most, if not all of the code from working. This will be annoying at first, but you will develop an eye for it if you keep coding! But I digress. Let's put this script into our HTML, so that it all comes  together:

    &lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt; Page title goes here &lt;/title&gt;
        
        &lt;style&gt;
          .grayscale.active {
            filter: grayscale(100%);
          }
        &lt;/style&gt;
        
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;

        &lt;img class=""grayscale""
             alt=""New England Patriots logo""
             src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/New_England_Patriots_logo.svg"" /&gt;

        &lt;script&gt;
          const images = document.querySelectorAll('.grayscale');
          images.forEach(image =&gt; {
            image.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
              image.classList.toggle('active');
            });
          });
        &lt;/script&gt;

      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

Once all of this is done, the result should work [like this](https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/0a4gk7th/). If not, check your code for typos, then check again.

fo9np8l,g5w435,"This worked great. The last addition I want to make is to be able to reset all the images back to their coloured start state. I tried using your logic with the button I previously had but obviously messed up somewhere. 

This is what I tried...

Add css link for a button: (I know it adds other css formatting but for my purpose it’s for the button)

       &lt;link href=""https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet""&gt;

add a button:

            &lt;span class=""btn btn-danger"" id=""reset""&gt;Reset Board&lt;/span&gt;

Add the following JavaScript:

     //reset code
        $('#reset').on('click', function() {
               const images = document.querySelectorAll('.grayscale');
     images.forEach(image =&gt; {
      //image.removeClass('grayscale'); - this was an alternate idea which also didn’t work
     image.classList.toggle('active');
                         });
                     });",1.0
foaifml,g5w435,"The button and bootstrap should be fine*, but the JS needs some tweaking;

`$('#reset')...` &lt;- this is a jQuery function, and it's only available if you include jQuery (as you did in your initial post). I would not recommend using jQuery these days, as it increases download size and [doesn't really offer that much](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) over built-in DOM methods. It also promotes some questionable programming habits, and general confusion - other reasons to skip it if you're still learning the ropes.

We can replace it with the built-in `querySelector` -function, like this:

    const resetButton = document.querySelector('#reset');

Note the difference; `querySelector` returns exactly one element (or nothing at all), whereas `querySelectorAll` returns a list of all matching elements. Furthermore, IDs must be unique, so we can reasonably expect to only select one element anyway.

The next part in your code (=adding an event listener) is also specific to jQuery. We can use the native method just like we did before:

    resetButton.addEventListener('click', function() { ...

Next, you're selecting all the elements with the ""grayscale"" class, then looping through them, and those parts are entirely fine as they are. You're also very close with removing the class, but again, jQuery might be messing with your head; `.removeClass()` is specific to jQuery. However, `classList` is native, and all you need to do to fix that line is change the `toggle` -call to a `remove` -call, like so:

    image.classList.remove('active');

Aaaand that should do the trick! Recap:

    //reset code
    const resetButton = document.querySelector('#reset');
    resetButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
      const images = document.querySelectorAll('.grayscale');
      images.forEach(image =&gt; {
        image.classList.remove('active');
      });

If you change the URL of an image to, for example, `http://cdn.home-designing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/attic-apartment.jpg` this image will appear. This is because that images is stored on an internet-facing server, noted by the beggining of the URL: `http://`. This is important from what I'm getting at.

On your computer, when you load the HTML from a folder, the URL on the browser will be something like `file://Documents/.../website/index.html` and if you want an image to show from that same folder you would put `image.jpg` on the source. And if in that `website` folder has a folder inside named `img`, as you said there was, you would put on the `src` tag: `img/image.jpg`.

Now I see on your code `/img/image.jpg`. That first `/` means that URL will start at the **root** of your website, which in this case is `file://` which means the root of your hard drive (something like `c:/` if you're on windows or `/` if you're on a unix machine).

So you should remove that first `/` from the `src` of the tag `img` so that it searches for the images beggining on the folder of the `index.html` file, instead of on the root of your machine.

fnz3b6x,g4nbk9,"I don't get it quite right... Why do you think putting more tags will make your page better? Often the opposite is the case. You should really think about what interaction patterns and UI components you need to deliver the message or information you want to share and build around them :)

    }
I think if we want to comply with the exercise word by word, this is the answer.

However, I don’t think it’s the best way to do it, by far.

Basically, we are using the for...in loop (as this is a jQuery lesson we could have perfectly used `jQuery.each`, which would look nicer, but, again, the exercise says for loop). This loops through all of an object’s keys (in JS there are not associative arrays, they’re actually objects).",1.0
fo0231y,g4j6mr,"If I were to follow those instructions exactly, I would do:

    for(let key in allCurrencies){
        const value  = allCurrencies[key];
        const option = document.createElement(""option"");
    
        option.setAttribuite(""val"", key);
        option.innerText = value;
    
        optionHTML += option.outerHTML;
    }

Otherwise I would probably do:

    for(let [key, value] of Object.entries(allCurrencies)){
        optionHTML += `
            &lt;option val=""${key}""&gt;
                ${value}
            &lt;/option&gt;
        `;    
    }

Side-note: none of this is using jQuery, because it's not really needed anymore and I haven't seen anywhere that uses it for a good few years.  If you 100% need jQuery to pass this class then hopefully someone else will step in and help out.  Make sure you don't use it when you enter the workforce, though!

fnxo3gl,g48f1t,"this doesn't have a lot to do with HTML, but nonetheless:

you're going to want to find a program (maybe this HWMonitor, maybe another) that can output its information in some way other than as pixels on a screen. 

in practice that means you'll need to find a program that can run from the command line, and that writes its results to a file (or to the console, since you can pipe that into a file.)

If you have such a thing, then you can write something Apache can run (PHP or whatever, I won't judge), that will spawn a process to run that program, grab the results, and send them to a browser as HTML.

apparently, windows 10 ships with something called [typeperf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/typeperf) that seems to be at least some of your requirements. maybe look into it, try running it from the command line to get a feel for it, practice [redirecting its output into a file](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/redirect-output-from-command-line-to-text-file/), and see if that gets you any closer to your goal.

    window.addEventListener(""mousemove"", updateBoxPosition);

fnnyn2g,g2we8q,Where does this go in the html body?,1.0
fnp8g1u,g2we8q,"What you're looking at is not HTML, but rather ""CSS"". CSS is basically used to style your HTML elements. CSS controls element color, font size, container widths and heights, font-family, and many other things. Websites cannot (or rather, very rarely) exist without CSS. It is integral to web development.  

CSS can exist in three places, typically:

* **Inline CSS** is the most specific, basic way to change an element, but it's also very inefficient (I'll explain why later). It is very rare that you'll use inline CSS except for testing purposes. Inline CSS is not best practice, but it looks like this (similar to what the guy above posted but they got it a bit wrong):

`&lt;p style=""color: red;""&gt;My text&lt;/p&gt;`

The text above will change the font color to red. If you wanted to change the background color, it'd look like this:

`&lt;p style=""color: red; background-color: blue;""&gt;My text&lt;/p&gt;`

The text above would be red, with a blue background. Now that we know how to do inline CSS, lets look at the other two methods:

* **Internal CSS** is when you place your styles within your `&lt;head&gt;` tag. All styles will be contained within a `&lt;style&gt;` tag. Here is what that would look like:


        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;style&gt;
                p {
                    color: red;
                    background-color: blue;
                }
                h1 {
                    color: orange;
                    font-size: 30px;
                }
            &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;

The above code, as you can see, is contained within a style tag inside your HTML's head tag. The code is basically saying ""**All** `&lt;p&gt;` tags on this page should be red, with a blue background. I also added another example, you might be able to guess what it does: it changes all the &lt;h1&gt; on your page to be orange, and have a font-size of 30 pixels. 

This is better than the inline code we went over, because now we don't have to add the style to every single `&lt;p&gt;` on the page. Imagine last minute, you decide you wanted green text instead of red? Now instead of changing every single `&lt;p&gt;` tag, you can just change the CSS in the `&lt;head&gt;`, and every `&lt;p&gt;` on the website will change accordingly. MASSIVE time saver. 

* **External CSS** is the last main kind of CSS, and functions very similarly to Internal CSS. The difference is, it is it's own file. You then link to this file in all of your HTML pages. As an example, lets say we have a CSS file called `MyStyles.css`. Then we'd put a line of code in all of our HTML pages that looks like this (contained in the `&lt;head&gt;`):

`&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""MyStyles.css""&gt;`

That line is a `&lt;link&gt;` tag with three attributes: rel, type, and href. the ""rel"" is saying ""the relationship of this link is stylesheet. The ""type"" is saying the file type is CSS. The ""href"" is the most important because it is telling the browser where the CSS file is located relative to your HTML page. That href links just like the `src` on an image, or an `&lt;a&gt;` tag.

The external CSS file will look exactly like what we described above, except it wouldn't be in any kind of style or head tag. So, the CSS file would contain:

    p {
        color: red;
        background-color: blue;
    }

Now, any HTML page that has that `&lt;link&gt;` we made in the `&lt;head&gt;` would display ALL of the `&lt;p&gt;` as red, with a blue background. Why use external CSS files? Because now if we need to make a change to the whole website, we can do it ALL with just one change to the CSS file, instead of changing every single page. External CSS is the best practice for web development. I suggest you do most all your styling this way. 

Make sense? If not, that's okay: start from the top and try to work through it. It'll make more sense in practice. Ask questions if you get tripped up. Good luck! And [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a quick tutorial on how CSS works that may be explained a bit better.",1.0

fnaepzq,g0k72q,It's a semantic Attribute. It tells you which other elemtn your Label belongs to.,2.0
fnaxbbp,g0k72q,"The `for` attribute used on a label is to ""connect"" the `&lt;label&gt;` element to its corresponding form field. The form field must then have an `id` attribute with the same value as the name in the `for`. Which is much easier if I just show you!

In the example you gave, there would be for example an input element, with an `id` attribute with a value of ""your\_name"".

    &lt;label for=""your_name""&gt;Your name:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id=""your_name"" name=""your_name type=""text"" /&gt;

# Why do this?

The default browser behaviour for this gives us several usability and accessability advantages. A user can now click on the `&lt;label&gt;` text, and the browser will focus (that is - put the cursor inside) the relevant input field. With radiobuttons and checkboxes this becomes extra useful, since they are notoriosly hard to hit with the mouse. A piece of text provides a larger hit-area.

It also helps as a navigation aid for users who rely on assistive technology to process the form.

Admin Dashboard sites usually consist of a static header bar, a left side toggle-collapsible navigation bar, and main content area

Blog sites will usually have a static header bar (with primary navigation in it), a main content area, and a secondary content area.

now, what those css classes do is (probably) set an icon style for the span, and then add additional styles specifically for the views.
