g8p46q2,jaemjr,"Sounds like the setup of the icon is wrong. Usally when you gonna use an icon you would have an element with that icon class. i.e `&lt;i class=""my-icon-pen""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;`, then in the css select all icons `[class^=""my-icon-""]:before, [class*="" my-icon-""]:before {}` to specify some ground css and then individually `.my-icon-pen:before { content: '\e800'; }`.

This I took from [http://fontello.com/](http://fontello.com/) but fontawesome and other do similar.

Just because you add a icon pack or something, it should not break your site or needing to do workarounds.",1.0

I am wondering if it just isn't compatible with divi?,1.0
g8ox7to,jaco3b,"No need to apologize.

Let's take a look at the first link you've provided, because it's the simplest one, it doesn't need you to change your HTML markup.

So how does it work ? 

  
**CSS**

    /* Flashlight Overlay */
    :root {
      cursor: none; /* Hide your cursor */
      --cursorX: 50vw; /* Declares a custom property representing the cursor position on the X axis */
      --cursorY: 50vh; /* Declares a custom property representing the cursor position on the Y axis */
    }
    :root:before { 
      /* Create a pseudo element on the root of the document.
      This pseudo element is the dark overlay on top of your page.
      We need to make sure that it will take the whole page
    */
      content: '';
      display: block;
      width: 100%; /* Make sure the overlay is 100% wide */
      height: 100%; /* Make sure the overlay is 100% tall */
      position: fixed; /* Make sure the overlay won't move when you scroll */
      pointer-events: none; /* You will be able to interact with the content under the overlay */
      background: radial-gradient(
        circle 10vmax at var(--cursorX) var(--cursorY),
        rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%,
        rgba(0,0,0,.5) 80%,
        rgba(0,0,0,.95) 100%
      ) /* Declares a circular gradial-radient going from transparent to black with an opacity of 0.95
      The center of the gradient is defined using the custom property we did defined before.
      Why using the custom properties ? Because you'll change them using javascript!
    */
    }

**Javascript**

    function update(e){
      var x = e.clientX || e.touches[0].clientX // get the position of the cursor on the X axis
      var y = e.clientY || e.touches[0].clientY // get the position of the cursor on the Y axis
    
      document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--cursorX', x + 'px') // update the custom property defined in the css
      document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--cursorY', y + 'px') // update the custom property defined in the css
    }
    
    document.addEventListener('mousemove',update) // Run the function when you move your cursor
    document.addEventListener('touchmove',update)

As you can see, you need both the css and the javascript to make it work.

The css is used to create an overlay with a radial gradient.    
The javascript is used to update the center of the radial gradient.",1.0

More importantly, and sadly not taught in popular CSS tutorials, you want to practice thinking like components. *Is the behavior of this element dependent on or determined by its ancestor?* If yes, then they are parts of the same component.

g8ay99c,j8aocu,Could you explain that further? I'm just starting with CSS/HTML and I'm not exactly sure what you mean (so maybe it's my beginner's confusion here...),2.0
g8b5iy7,j8aocu,"Sure thing - so the 'trinity' that I'm talking about here is HTML / CSS / JS - and they all go hand-in-hand.  The role of HTML is to describe its contents as accurately as possible, the role of CSS is to define all the different style-states that are possible, and the role of JS is to extend the HTML and CSS beyond their limitations by manipulating them and adding additional functionality.

The primary beef I raised here is [semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) \- in HTML, `&lt;div&gt;` and `&lt;span&gt;` don't mean anything - their purpose is just to provide something to attach a css class to; if you want to say that a HTML element is clickable and it will change something on the page, then you should use a `&lt;button&gt;`; if you want to say it's clickable and it will link somewhere then you should use an `&lt;a&gt;`.

It doesn't matter if these HTML elements don't look how you want them to; because that's where CSS comes in and allows you to style them however you like.  If you don't use accurate markup then:

* **Screen-readers don't understand what the content is** \- hurting users of assistive technologies (which, for context, usually outnumber Safari users, so not an insignificant number)
* **Crawlers don't userstand what the content is** \- hurting your SEO and also shortening the lifespan of your site; how can a smartphone render 'simplified view' or a smartwatch figure out what content to include and what to omit if it doesn't understand what the content is?
* **It makes the code harder to maintain** \- if everything is a `&lt;div&gt;` then all you have to go on in the codebase is the class names, and that can become a headache fast.  If you have code that can explain its purpose at a glance, then everything becomes a lot easier.  This can be enhanced further by plugging any gaps in the HTML spec using [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets).

This is, unfortunately, a bit of a common problem in webdev, which is why I make an effort to call it out when I see it; people don't all have the same experience as you do!

Some users view sites at fullscreen, some snap to half their window, some mac users like to have lots of strangely-sized windows - make sure your code can accomodate them!

Some users view sites at 200% zoom to make the text more readable, some users rely on screen-readers and chrome extensions to navigate the site through audio cues instead of visual ones, some users rely only on [keyboard shortcuts to navigate between  headings and landmarks](https://youtu.be/vAAzdi1xuUY) on the page - make sure your code can accomodate them too!

g83of2o,j7b8su,"You've spotted many of the downsides of Tailwind. The unreadable markup, and inability to update related values contextually.

You can use `@apply` to build a custom class name out of all the atomic Tailwind properties, but even the creator of Tailwind says any usage of @apply is an anti-pattern. It was only added to trick people who saw the unreadable markup and said ""No way"". Literally, that's the reason it's there, not for you to use, but as a means to get people with better sense to try it.

Vue has several very nice ways of handling styles built in. Such as easy Sass access in any component or automated scoping via CSS Modules or Vue's built in `scoped` attribute.

If you are using either of the scoped approaches then you have no benefit in using BEM or Atomic styles.

I'm far more interested in what Facebook is doing right now. they write their styles with semantic class names and during the build convert all classes to atomic CSS.

**Atomic CSS** is writing your classes atomically

g840xh7,j7b8su,"We use Tailwind at work. We use the many-classes-on-one-element-to-build-it when it's something that's not re-used (a one-off element), and use the apply directive on a class when it's a component that's re-used. This lets us make sweeping changes easily.

We also try to use more ""purpose-driven"" names for colors rather than over-using color-based names. For main colors on the site, we use variables like theme-1, theme-2, theme-3, etc for the primary colors so that we can easily make sweeping changes. We just had a client rebrand mid-project that required sweeping color changes, and so we just changed the theme-1 and theme-2 and most of the work was done just by doing that, just needs a few individual settings tweaks here and there for certain components. We do have color-based names too, but mostly for minor components or rare accent colors.

We've also played around with naming colors things like button-primary, button-primary-hover, things like that so that we can easily change things, and that worked nicely for remixing individual elements more specifically.",3.0

g84ohnj,j7b8su,"I also heard that `@apply` was not encouraged back in the days. However in the latest version it gets a huge update. I.e. the ability to use pseudo classes within `@apply` (it's still experimental and you have to opt-in but I'm sure it will become a default and it won't be so discouraged anymore)

For example Take a look at Kutty..

You can either use it or do the same yourself.

And btw, Tailwind is indeed very customizable at the end of the day..

I was also reticent to use it. But finally I found it easier to use. I don't have to think about naming classes and handling together the structure/styling.

Something worth noting is that we can also use appropriately the tooling. For example VSCode has some great extensions (auto completing, previewing the rules, ordering the classes, and you can use efficiently some search and replace shortcuts)

Adam Wathan (author of Tailwind) make regularly some screencasts and his workflow seems very efficient.

Don't hesitate to give some updates..

I wanted to hear if it worked for you..",2.0
g84tu2m,j7b8su,"I started to use tailwind a few days ago, after years getting sick of other css frameworks and then years writing custom css (sass, stylus, less). I work for a company that has strong and strict brand guidelines and I tried to tweak tailwind to match. The config js file is very flexible and while it took hours to customize, now it's very handy. VScode plays nicely together with it (via extension) - in one tab I extend the theme config, in the other tab new classes are immediately shown on hover, in scss or html file (Angular). I'm satisfied so far, I was also afraid of the too many classes in css but that's not that bad. With these other less frontend colleagues can also style things, and you can show them the docs when they are stuck, which is not the case with custom css.

Lastly the purge feature worth mentioning. You can add as many utilities you may ever need, on prod build extra ones will be removed don't need to worry about the final size.",2.0

The good part having in dev the whole CSS file (which is big with 3 to 5 MB) is that the assets pipeline isn't kicked when doing modification.

And the markup changes is instantly shown.

Another great use case of the tooling worth mentioning is the usage of the injection of classes in real-time in the developer tools (the input appears when clicking in the `.cls` button).

g84p4ov,j7b8su,"We *only* use @apply when there’s no HTML element to apply a class to.

Long term maintenance of tailwind projects we’ve found is actually easier for 2 reasons

1. You don’t end up just getting a bigger and bigger CSS file due to adding more code after time, it has a finite file size.

2. You can change individual items without worrying about if it will effect other pages. Eg “can we make button X on page Y bigger” - yes, easily without worrying about any side effects anywhere else.

Unless your in static HTML land, most systems will have the ability to “include” other files, so you can easily make a “button.blade.php” if you want to encapsulate logic.

Saying that.. buttons and form inputs are pretty much the only types of elements we use @apply for - it’s normally the go to example people use when talking about tailwind.

My stack for this project is:  
\- React  
\- Gatsby  
\- Typescript  
\- Styled-components  and Sass  


Everything here is an overkill for this project and all you need is HTML and CSS/Sass and on few projects JS.  
I'm using Gatsby because It's easier to host on Netlify  (have no money to host somewhere else).  Also, I created templating, on every build, it looks in /days folder and for every component there creates a page with the template. So it's easily scalable and I don't need to worry about that.   


Typescript is also overkill, but I was struggling with typescript, so I don't mind if it's slowing me down If I'm learning.  


Styled-components - I just love styled-components :)  Sass is only for reset and normalize. If you are interested you can see my starter for Gatsby [here](https://github.com/MarinoKolaric/gatsby-starter).",2.0
g83gysz,j6sboj,"Nice. It's fun to play around with new toys 😄.

I tried Gatsby a couple of years ago. It's a very nice developer experience but I find it very heavy and slow for blogs or medium or small company websites. That was the kind of stuff I was building, so it was a bad fit for me.

Migrated to 11ty and it has been a breeze since then. It's not as well paved road for developers but I can easily extend it my self. It's not React, but that's what makes it fast. And I don't have to mess around with graphQL to just read my markdown files. That's almost the biggest bonus.

It's also as easy to host on Netlify, can't go back from that hosting experience. It's so good.

I also have to get more into typescript, starting a bigger project with it and it will hopefully show why it's so popular.",2.0

I just struggle to see where you would want Gatsby. If I want a React app with all the bells and whistles I would go for anext or something and if I want a simpler thing I wouldn't use React as it's so heavy.

g83rsgh,j6sboj,"I can't talk about nextJS, because I have no experience with that.   
But for Gatsby vs React (CRA), Gatsby is IMO on steroids. You have wrapper components that simplify things like routing, linking, and handling images, which are not in the core React.  
You also have a great ecosystem of plugins that serve various needs (optimizing, lazy-loading, images).   


 \&gt; I wouldn't use React as it's so heavy   
Do you mean for developing? I agree with you on that, that is my mistake. But it's not heavy for the end-user, once the loaded app is fast.   


\&gt; Have you found a good project for Gatsby?   
This is my second project on Gatsby, the first was my personal portfolio site.

g840y5x,j6sboj,"Those components that you talk about are mostly community projects that can be used in any React project. The lazy loading image optimization is nice but it is super slow when compiling and lazy loading is in most browsers natively now.

As for being heavy, I meant for the end user. When you load a Gatsby site it first loads the whole page as html, to look fast and then it downloads the page as JavaScript along with react and all components. That is super heavy on a slow connection and very wasteful.

It would be ok if it was ever needed but I struggle to see the need. Gatsby is mostly for blogs and portfolios (in my understanding) and seldom use very dynamic data that need a whole library to handle a state based UI with Dom diffing and such.

No. Not sure what you mean by this. Position absolute/relative items don't affect items that come before or after them, because they are not in the flow.

if you understand 'the flow' (position: static), and understand that position absolute/relative items aren't in the flow (because e.g. an item that is position: relative can't also be position: static), you are most of the way there.

If position absolute/relative items don't get their position from the flow algorithm, where do they get positioned? Absolutely positioned items go where you specify (top, left, etc.), or zero (i.e. top left) if you don't specify anywhere, relative to any parent item also not in the flow. Relative items are positioned at an offset you specify (top, left, etc.), or zero, from where the flow algorithm would have positioned them.

So to see why the yellow box is where it is, change position to 'static' - that's where it would be in the flow (hidden behind the red box - maybe make them different sizes?). Now change it to 'relative', you've specified the bottom edge move up  by 10px.",3.0

&gt;For some context, I was trying to hide lines of text past a certain number `--max-lines`

g7rmk4p,j5bu16,"Not exactly sure what is causing that, if you're setting both font-size and line-height to the same value of 1.5rem  , then I would assume without a parent element with its own styles, the browsers themselves  are effecting the overall height in some way.     

I would also recommend against hard units like pixels, em, or rem with line-height and instead suggest the numeric value (e.g. 1.5 which calculates font-size \* 1.5) or use a percentage value (e.g. 150%) which gives more consistent results down the line if modifying font size with js or some other way.     

As for your attempt to limit the number of lines with --max-lines,  you would also need to include block-overflow: clip  to prevent the peeking. Otherwise, the browser will still render those lines.",1.0

* You can set height of the other elements to be the same as the datepickers height. Currently the inputs are unstyled and use the browsers default styles.

   * The styles can be overwritten
   * Also it's possible to import the component with no styles and write your own, as [described in the docs](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-date-picker#custom-styling).

&gt; With flex box and Css grid, is there a place for frameworks. Can they work together on the same project or will they fight with each other

These are mutually exclusive. A framework can support flexbox and/or grid. For instance, Bootstrap 4 uses flexbox. This is an opinionated decision based on browser support and trends. Flexbox and grid work without frameworks too, and they play nicely together.

Here's the test site: [https://awesome-yalow-665b5d.netlify.app/](https://awesome-yalow-665b5d.netlify.app/) (directly linked to [https://github.com/XtremePwnership/testAvesta](https://github.com/XtremePwnership/testAvesta)) (my final goal is a PWA for mobile phones, hence the layout)

If you click on the photos in the 3rd section, they float up beautifully to the 2nd section, thanks to your magic!  Slight problem though.

What i want to happen: at the origin the image height should be 100% (as the parent element is small) but at destination i want to keep `height: 70% &amp; margin-right: 10px`. So what i did was create 2 different classes, one for the origin &amp; other for the destination, `thirdSectionPhotos` &amp; `secondSectionPhotos` respectively. Then in your JS file at line nos 55, 56, 98 &amp; 99 i did the class switching. However end result is bad: class gets changed first which causes the element to make a weird jump before the animation starts. (slowed down the animation to see what exactly is going wrong)

How could i animate the height &amp; margin change so that it is smooth? This coarse class switching i've done just to demonstrate my goal to you. I tried a lot to learn how to animate height &amp; margin but nothing worked properly upon many trial &amp; errors.

Your animation is working FANTASTIC, thanks for your massive help! :D Also, don't bother about that question i asked you about animating the height &amp; margin, i sped up the animation to 100 ms so that that sudden jerk at the beginning is unnoticeable by the user. Also, improves the UX since user doesn't have to wait 300 ms before tapping another button.

i tested the PWA on BrowserStack and seems to be working great on many devices! Only on Safari the `.animate()` function is not supported, so what i did was translate your code to this https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js Pollyfill API which apparently *is* supported by Safari.

g6yjdd2,j1cn0r,"This may be confusing, but I'll try to describe it.

Relative positioning. Changes the position of an element relative to where it normally is. Keeps the element in the flow of the document. Example. You have a H2 on a page, above it is a paragraph, and below it is a paragraph. You want to move the h2 to the left 20px from it's current position. position:relative; left:-20px; Would do just that. Move it negative 20px to the left while keeping everything else in the flow.

Absolute positioning takes an element OUT of the flow and is positioned based on the closet parent element that is set to position relative. When you position an element absolutely, think of it like the page assumes the element isn't there. So if you positioned the h2 above absolutely, the paragraphs would collapse as the page doesn't see the h2 as even existing and will take up no space on the page.

To experiment, you can just open any web page, then open the dev tools...

When you use the relative and absolute method on an element and style it. For example, a heading with a custom underline. The heading is positioned as the relative element and I create a absolute element from the heading (with ::after or ::before). How can I make sure that when I’m resizing the window, the underline that I had created will stay in the same position?

g71xg2y,j1cn0r,"Ironically, that's a little harder.  This is the best I could do. 

- **Relative**: Try to always use this.  In the real world, you want to be flexible based on resolutions and screen sizes.  (ie: tablets vs phones vs PC)

- **Absolute**: This is lazy design.  It makes your page very static and requires a lot of zooming, but it can give you more control. (edit: think of an ad that shows up on top of your page in the same location every time, regardless of what the rest of the page is doing - still lazy though).",2.0
g71ydtt,j1cn0r,"ok

sorry but I have some learning issues, may I repeat it and tell me if I said it good? I learn the best like that.

So like:

Relative: I should use it on almost every element, cus in that way, they will change size according to the screen size (or zoom amount), and preserve the placements of every element in relation and ratios to other elements.

&amp;#x200B;

Absolute: anchors the element 20px from the left document's body edge (assuming u used left: 20px) without consideration of other elements around it or above it.

&amp;#x200B;

Am i close?",1.0
g72141x,j1cn0r,"Pretty much.  For relative, I'd also use % rather than hard pixel counts.  This let's you space out the page elements off total size even when that size changes.  It's harder to do right, but you'll get better results.

Just note that this is not going to be affected by zoom. With absolute, to see everything, you  may need to zoom out or scroll.  With relative, it *should* reposition the elements in a way that it limits the need to scroll or zoom.",2.0

g6yl7az,j1cn0r,"Relative positioning cares about the flow of the document and elements in it. If you put div under another div and they are relatively positioned they stack on top if each other like you would expect. The element is **relative to itself**; left: 20px; will simply move a div 20px from the left edge.

Absolute position indicates that the elemets position is absolute, no matter what happens the element will be positioned the same. Note that positioning is done relatively positioned to the nearest positioned parent. Thing with absolute position is that the element doesn't care about documents flow or things moving around it.

Say you have a relative rectangular div *&lt;div class=""rectangle""&gt;* relatively positioned. Inside that div you have another div *&lt;div class=""star""&gt;* with absolute position and top: 0; right: 0;

This means that *star* will always be in the top right corner of the *rectangle* no matter the size and the concrete rectangles position. It is **absolutely** positioned relatively to it's nearest parent - *rectangle.*

Best way is to open a editor and just try everything. Without good visual representation &amp; trial and error it is a little bit tricky to get a proper hang of position property.",3.0
g71fstp,j1cn0r,"So like

&lt;position: relative;&gt; is saying ''no matter what, your position commands will apply only relativly to your parent item''?

g6yco1p,j1cn0r,"Sorry, i dont have a reference for you - but what i would say is: First of all you have to understand \*The Flow\*. It's the default Position strategy, and it's the most important concept there is in web layout. So, do you understand The Flow? Once you do, Absolute and Relative are not too dificult to describe in terms of, and contrasting to, the Flow. Both are slightly different ways to 'get out' of The Flow, but you can't really hope to understand what that means without a good understanding of the central concept of web layout.",2.0

g6yltz5,j1cn0r,"the key is understanding that by default you are in the flow - it's no use setting x and y on an element - it won't do anything because you dont get to directly choose where an element is placed. However, you can specify that an item is not in the flow - which means you will choose where it is positioned explicitly. To do this you set the 'position' attribute. Absolute and Relative are two of the posible values.",2.0
g71f97x,j1cn0r,"Ok, so the position attribute is just specifying if the item is in the flow or out of it? did i get it right?

So you say absolute and relative are just there for saying whether the item is in the default position or in a position I'll specify? which one says what?",1.0
g71fyaj,j1cn0r,"more accurately: every item is in the Flow because every item has the default value of 'position: static'. Yes, it should have been called 'position: flow' but hey, CSS.

Some alternatives to position: flow (don't type that, really 'static') are *position: absolute* (i'll set the value) and *position: relative* (i'll set the offset from where the Flow would put it). There are other, less significant options you should read about.

This doesn't begin to convey how important *position: absolute* and *relative* are or why you would want to use them. You're going to have to keep studying to get that, but their use can be subtle. In reality it's hard to build almost any layout without them. I would recommend opening up the web inspector and looking through e.g. reddit or twitter DOM for examples of *position:absolute* elements and try and work out why they need to be that way - it might not be obvious. Try toggling the position value off and on and seeing what difference it makes.",1.0
g71l5ce,j1cn0r,"What am I missing here, I used position relative on a h1. Then I used ::after on the h1 and made a 100px vertical line to separate/or lead to some links. However, after resizing the window, the line gets smushed into the content instead of having its own block?",1.0
g71vdsc,j1cn0r,"Ok so basically absolute positioned elements will not give a damn about any other element.

you tell them to stay 20px away from the left? they will, and always will even if it's on other stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

on the other hand, a relatively positioned element will take your 20px command, but it will consider the bigger element after him (or: his parent element), so if your element is inside a bigger element, it will stay 20px away from the left of the bigger element, and not the page flow's edge.

&amp;#x200B;

right?

please I hope im right lmao",1.0
g71i150,j1cn0r,"as a sort of hint: relative and absolute divs can function like 'Layers' in  Photoshop or layout software, their content is in the flow, but you've divided it up into separate, position-able elements",1.0
g6yp2gt,j1cn0r,"ELI5: If you put a bunch of boxes on the page, and don't tell them a position, their parents decide where they should go. If you tell them to have a relative position with **top**: 10px, they go ""*Ok, well this is where I should go, but I'll go 10px from the top of here.*""

If you have tell the box to have absolute positioning with **top:**10px, it goes ""*I don't care where I should go, I'm going to stand over at 10px from the top.""* Where is the top? Well it checks if it's parent has a position value, then chooses their top as 0. If that parent isn't positioned, it checks the grandparent, then the great grandparent and so on until it reaches the document body.

Position: Relative is like a normal kid. It knows where it should go but it can sometimes move from that position.

Position: Absolute is like an unruly kid. It goes where it wants, but if it's parents are positioned, they can keep it in (their) line.

  


Tl;dr: Position Relative with no top, right, left, bottom values (or = 0) won't move from where it's located based on padding, margings, other elements, etc, but a position Absolute with the same position values will move to the top right of the closest ancestor with their position declared.",2.0

g6sifb9,j0ktrr,"Not really. If you check the CSS code in the Codepen link, the ""nav ul li a"" declaration points to the button-like links (Home, Staff, Media ...). I want to add a ""padding"" and get the text centered on those buttons. However, I ran into a problem while centering and that's why I put 2 comments in my code. The first refers to the form that I consider appropriate: adding a ""padding"" equal to top and bottom and to left and right (padding: .7rem 3.5rem;). However this places the text slightly upwards.

The second comment was the solution I found to center the text: adding, by trial and error, the padding values ​​that make my text centered (padding: 0.7rem 3.5rem 0 3.5rem;). However, this last form does not seem so optimal to me and few times (never really) have I seen an implementation like it.

just did a quick comparison; Tailwind has aprox 4,242 classes vs masscss only at 1,387

so on this regard, Tailwind is actually *more* massive.

And like you point out, Tailwind has build features (for masscss I simply recommend [uncss](https://github.com/uncss/uncss))

so evidently Tailwind is massively superior to masscss !

That said, there will be minor differences in implementation.    So perhaps there are some pros to masscss that make it slighlty *less* superior.   I will have to play more with Tailwind and determine what those may be, if anything.   In the meantime, if you like the simplicity of [basscss](https://github.com/basscss/basscss) ie- its implementation of flexbox and other features then you might like masscss for prototyping, perhaps even for production when combined with uncss.",1.0

g6mfuxl,izvucp,"You could go with a method like KiwiWater shared but those shapes from CSS Tricks are all based on borders and making content in borders isn't super fun.  


Another method would be to use clip-path for the shapes ([Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) is nice for this), some CSS grid for positioning, and some CSS vars with CSS calc to fake the borders between elements... Like [this](https://svelte.dev/repl/19fd8cf0c6d64f5aa8897f5cab938156?version=3.28.0) but you'd have to do something with Javascript if you want responsiveness... or maybe there's some hack out there for dynamically changing height as a unit relative to width that I don't know about.   


In the example I'm using Svelte to change the height and width of the overall shape for responsiveness but everything inside is relative to the wrapper shape, you can use Vanilla JS instead all you need is \`clientWidth\` and then change your style to match it... The tricky part with this method would be text placement, you can do grids inside each of the shapes, but if you want some uniform positioning you'll have to spend some time working out the details, and if you want true responsiveness you'll need to spend extra time on media queries, good luck.",2.0

You used `margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;`, which could also be shortened to this `margin: 0 auto;`.

If it is an issue, you can always these properties separately, just like you did with the margins.

Finally, even after all that effort what you can get isn’t real vertical rhythm anyways because you can’t control height of content block, only line height due to the fact that browser size and content font size and length are dynamic, so it isn’t possible to completely control both x and y size.

* Since you'll want to have multiple cards on the screen at the same time, you shouldn't be using `id`s as styling selectors. `id`s are meant to appear exactly once on a page, and if you have 10 cards, you have 10 `id`s. For styling use `class`es instead.
* If you want to resize stuff, it's a good idea to use [relative units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units) instead of pixels for everything.

g5r0chf,iveih1,"This is really cool!! I like the idea a lot, and would go one of two directions if it were me...  


I think it would be REALLY cool to build this with more CSS first, like using CSS grid and really breaking everything out into code instead of a series of absolutely positioned images. That's definitely more of a CSS illustration challenge though, instead of a logical approach for a full app experience.  


Given your usecase, instead I'd look at refactoring this into an SVG, and potentially using a framework like React or Vue to create a component that can take arguments to place the text, images, and properties in the correct place in each instance. SVG will scale the way you are describing, with everything keeping its proportion as the width of the card changes and also be vector, therefore staying as sharp as possible for any non-rasterized elements within it. Integrating React or Vue would allow you to compose the cards similarly to: 

`&lt;card name=""Baby Dragan"" stars=""3"" type=""Dragon"" face=""https://i.ibb.co/wr9CV2B/img.jpg"" description=""Much more than just a child, this dragon is gifted with untapped power."" attack=""1200"" defense=""700"" element=""wind"" /&gt;`

    this.className += "" class2""

You could alternatively add the class using `this.classList.add('class2')`. In either case, you would then target the element with `.class1.class2` in accordance with the selector rules described above.",3.0
g5mrkdd,iumucz,"You seem to be mixing up the concept of a CSS selector and a class name.

`.class1.class2`, `.class1 .class2`, `.class1, .class2` - these are all CSS selectors. They are expressions in the specialized query language CSS uses to find elements on the page that match the criteria you specify.

`this.className` - assuming `this` is an HTML element as implied - is a shorthand property used to control the class names applied to a specific element. Think of it like an array, where `+=` is used to append to the array. It has no representation as a CSS selector, because it's not a query - it's the data being queried. If you're familiar with SQL, `this.className` is a table row. CSS Selectors are SQL itself.

This is slightly confusing because of the weird usage of `className` and the whole `+=` thing. This is an old piece of tech. The modern way to control class names is to use [`.classList`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)

```
&gt;&gt; this.classList
[""class1""]

&gt;&gt; this.classList.add('class2');
[""class1"", ""class2""]

&gt;&gt; this.classList.toggle('class1');
[""class2""]

g52qj5t,irq1ic,Why not? Not familiar with how http protocols work.,4.0
g53wguo,irq1ic,"http/2 allows more concurrent downloads. It removes the penalty associated with downloading multiple files through multiple https requests, because a single request can retrieve many files.

Potentially working against this is that there is still a header overhead for each file, so very small files take a larger hit because their header overhead is a larger portion of their overall size and this can add up over dozens or hundreds of images.

Small files also compress significantly less efficiently, and below a certain threshold, many hosts simply won't bother with compression because it isn't worth the resource debt.

On the other side, if you're serving three or four dozen images in a sprite sheet and users are only visiting a page that uses half a dozen of them, you're sending a lot of data for little use. 

If you have repeat traffic that benefits from caching, then changing a single image in a sprite sheet will necessitate breaking the cache for the whole sheet rather than the single image.

It is a surprisingly complex topic that has no one size solutions. You really have to look at how you use the images and how your users use your site to come to a good solution.

g4wuvxa,ir1iqm,"You'll the word 'semantic' pop up a lot when you're doing webdev - this is an example of what it means!

A `&lt;div&gt;` has no semantic meaning.

A `&lt;section&gt;` 'semantically groups' content and creates what's called a 'sectioning  root' - ie. any `&lt;h1&gt;`, `&lt;h2&gt;` elements etc within it will become the 'name' of that element for accessibility purposes; it's also the vaguest possible grouping that you can do in HTML, so here's some others as well:

* `&lt;article&gt;` \- for when you want to group content but make it clear that it the content is self-contained and independently understandable.  If for whatever reason you can't use the `&lt;article&gt;` tag you can also use the `role=""article""` attribute to convey this meaning.
* `&lt;aside&gt;` \- for when you want to provide 'extra' or 'additional' information to the sectioning root it's inside of.  If you can't use this tag for whatever reason, you can also use the `role=""complementary""` attribute to convey the same meaning.
* `&lt;figure&gt;` \- for when you want to provide something that is illustrative of the information in the sectioning root.  If you can't use this tag, then the `role=""figure""` attribute will also work - however, the `&lt;figure&gt;` comes paired with a `&lt;figcaption&gt;` which you can use to 'caption' your figure, and there's no attribute alternative you can use to convey the same information.

Honestly, writing semantic HTML is extremely important as a web developer; users with assistive technologies rely on it to understand what the content is and how it all fits together.  We spend a lot of time on /r/css making things work across browsers - but the number of users who rely on accessible HTML far outstrips the number of Safari or Firefox users.

On a more selfish note: bots use semantic HTML to crawl and understand your site, so if you want your site to be indexed correctly and get a good SEO ranking - you'll want your HTML to be accessible.  It also helps future-proof your site for devices that don't exist yet - for example; how does a smartwatch view a webpage? It finds the most important information by looking at the HTML and discards the rest.

For website with commercial value, it only harms the site owner, for site without commercial value, no one bothers to do anything with the semantic structure you painstakingly added.

Or you skip named rows altogether (`grid-template-rows: repeat(min-content, 9)`) and set the `grid-row` on each element to resolve to the proper row somehow....

\&gt;  how would I know when I should use the parent element or class name as opposed to just the child name

Whenever you have an element whose CSS isn't working properly, you can debug it. I'd recommend using Chrome for this, as it has easily the best CSS tools. This is what to do:

a. Right-click on the problem element.  
b. Choose ""Inspect Element""  
c. In the bottom-right corner is listed all the CSS that's applied to your element.

* If your CSS is crossed out and yellow, it's a syntax error and the browser couldn't interpret it correctly.
* If it's crossed out, but NOT yellow, that means something else is overriding it. You can test if something else is overriding it by adding ""!important"". In this case, adding more parent classes would probably help.
* If it's not crossed out at all, it means your CSS has a different problem, probably caused by conflicting CSS rules. For example, perhaps you're trying to add padding-top to a &lt;span&gt;, which is an inline element and can't have padding, unless you give display:inline-block.",1.0

        transform-style:preserve-3d;

        position:absolute;
        left: 0;
        top: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;

So a card has two faces, and it rotates the parent object to show the back face.

\* means it will target all the elements on HTML

g463vsa,in8zym,"Images are rarely inserted directly via CSS because of these reasons:

* Usually you want the image to be just that - a normal image, so an `&lt;img&gt;` tag with `alt` attribute, possibly multiple `srcset` values etc. You do all of this inside HTML. This way the image is treated as a semantic member of the document, which is good for SEO, screen readers, printing the page and so on.
* If you are using an image for background as `background-image`, it is done via CSS, but where you set the `url` of this image file depends. If it is an icon sprite, you may want to define the url in stylesheet, since it's common for multiple elements. However, if it is a background image that might be different from page to page, it's a good idea to set it via inline style in HTML, i.e. `&lt;div style=""background-image: url(...)""`, because it's very common you'll want to insert different image url's in a template, but keep other styles the same - so your CMS, static site generator or whatever you use can insert the correct url inside the HTML template instead of having different CSS styles for each page.

I personally would only insert images via CSS if they

* are going to be the same on each page (like icons)
* don't need to be crawlable by search engines / interpreted by screen readers
* are small enough to not need multiple resolutions for different screen sizes and pixel densities
* always have a known, fixed proportion, since `background-image` doesn't care about how big the image is (so you need to define a container for it yourself). If you want to insert an image that has to be 100% wide and push down content with its height, you'll need to insert it via HTML, so the layout rendering engine knows about the images dimensions.",20.0

If the image is vital to understanding the content, then you should use HTML img tag with proper title and alt attributes. Ex: An image of a product you are about to purchase OR an image of a map used on an educational website.

If the image is decoration and does not contain vital information, then do whatever you want. Ex: facebooks’s cover photo, iconography that has supporting text, or a hero image that is pretty, but doesn’t add real context to the page.

g3ymwu4,imc8s8,"Well, don't think of CSS as programming, it can be considered turing complete but the majority of CSS won't approach that area. It's like painting, different tools do different things to the canvas. 

Best CSS practices can be argued. Some people like coding in BEM which is a way of naming classes. I prefer just .first-last for naming. Do not write inline styles, that's universally agreed on as bad practice. Remember that its called CASCADING style sheets. Start top to bottom, keep resets first, * then HTML, body, nav, and work your way down the HTML. Also, I would try to avoid using Pixel values as much as possible, its not responsive in this day and age, however, I do use them for max-values. Here is something I use on all of my projects.

    *, *::before, *::after {
      box-sizing: inherit;
    }

    html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    
    body {
     height: 100%;
     line-height: 1.5;
     text-rendering: optimizeLegibility !important;

      -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale !important;
     text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.004);
    }

It is a lot of repetition to learn CSS properties, but the best way to learn CSS is by just making something, look at a website you like, and create it. Do not rely on things like bootstrap or tailwind. Learn CSS Grid and flexbox. Learn units like vw, vh, em and rem. And remember to have fun, CSS doesn't have to be a guessing game.

g3ysrs3,imc8s8,"I'm a beginner web developer and I've always used id as a selector without knowing it was bad practice.
What makes it bad?",2.0
g3yvc6m,imc8s8,"Specificity! Think back to elementary school with the 1s, 10s, 100s columns... If you have any digit at all in the hundreds column, that number is ALWAYS higher than anything you can fit in just the tens and ones columns alone. CSS specificity is similar. The 1s columns are your base elements:

`p`, `a`, `div`

The 10s are classes: `.content`

    p { color: blue; }
    p.content { color: red; }
    .content { color: green; }

The text for `&lt;p class=""content""&gt;` will be red because that rule has the highest specificity. 

When you add `id` to the mix, it has a higher specificity than `class` so any rule you put towards an `id` selector will always trump a class rule. 

That might not seem like a bad thing initially, but consider this:

    #main { color: #222; }

Your main body has a light background and this dark grey as the text. Later, you want a little box with a dark background and light text: `&lt;div class=""myBox""&gt;`

    .myBox { color: white; }

Well this won't be white because your `#main` rule trumps it because of specificity. You either have to complicate your selector (`#main .myBox`) or make this an id (`#myBox`) or add an `!important` declaration to your new rule. The second option is bad because maybe you want two of these boxes, so you don't want an id since an id is only to be used for one unique element on the page. Complicating your selectors means more typing and harder debugging later. Important declarations are bad because it's even harder to trump those... So you've got all these complications because you used an id. 

What did the id *gain* for you? Nothing. It does nothing that a class couldn't do. If you'd just done `class=""main""` instead of `id=""main""`, you'd have no issues with your `.myBox` rule at all.

g3v6kbo,ilvy83,"Adam Wathan’s classic article on the subject is the best introduction to the reasoning that leads to embracing functional CSS: https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns

Academically, tailwind is supposed to allow you to do the following:

- create styles that are easier to reason about, since all you have to do to understand what something looks like is study the class list on the element;

- enforce a design system by only allowing people to pick from a preset list of defined values for things like colour, font size and spacing;

- make css more manageable by encouraging people to create abstractions only at the point where they feel justified, so that the stylesheet doesn’t fill up with dead styles.

While these ideas feel like they make sense in the abstract, I’ve always viewed tailwind and other functional frameworks as a bit of a radical anti pattern. My takeaway from the linked article is that the logic is sound, but the conclusion is flawed - yes, ‘separation of concerns’ is a straw man, but actually we should view this as a signal that CSS and HTML are by necessity deeply intertwined and we should embrace this fact, not try to get away from it.

In other words, it is the CSS described in the Phase 1 of the article - the deeply nested sort, making heavy use of child descendants and targeting tags directly - that represents the cleanest approach to writing CSS for the modern web.

Writing CSS like this addresses the issue of overly wrought semantics and CSS that is hard to delete. It makes CSS easier to reason about, because the structure of the markup is mirrored. The issue regarding design systems can also be solved using SCSS variables.

In other words, I remain unconvinced it solves anything that can’t be solved through other means. However, child descendants and targeting tags directly have been unfairly maligned for some time now by people who don’t understand how they should be used properly, so what I’ve written here represents a rather unfashionable view that likely won’t be taken seriously for quite some time.

In the meantime, I’ll keep waiting for that lightbulb moment where I can finally get why people get so excited about this stuff, because for me, I haven’t quite gotten there yet.",22.0
g3ykadi,ilvy83,"&gt; In other words, it is the CSS described in the Phase 1 of the article - the deeply nested sort, making heavy use of child descendants and targeting tags directly - that represents the cleanest approach to writing CSS for the modern web.

I absolutely agree with this mindset. I think what's necessary is to fully integrate the nesting pattern preprocessors like SCSS offer into normal CSS, because then the structure of the CSS follows that of the HTML.

To me, the problem *all* the view libraries actually solve is how to design for non-designers. CSS, at its best, is a vehicle for design, which I think also explains why it tends to be maligned and derided among a lot of IT types, who are very much not designers and at their worst can come off as anti-design.",1.0

I'm proficient with CSS, so I wouldn't pick it on a personal or small project because it is much quicker for me just to write the CSS, declare all the variables and utility classes myself.

However on a large project with lots of developers with different levels of CSS knowledge it has the advantage of people using classes, for margin spacing for example, instead of writing CSS with a random px value for margin. This makes sizing, font and colours more consistent throughout a project.

It can also make styling easier to debug as all of the CSS is there and you don't have to go searching throughout the project in multiple files to figure out what's going on.",6.0

- No need to spend additional time writing css for majority of the build

One of the benefits of CSS frameworks is that other developers know how to work with them. There's documentation and as the project grows other developers can follow the patterns of the framework.  


Reusable or utility classes are what I imagine tailwind is trying to solve. More of the file's weight resides on the HTML you're writing (stuffing classes into your HTML tags), rather than writing specific CSS for individual divs. I'm a developer that loves looking at utility classes and keeping custom stylesheets small... placing the burden (or stuffing classes into HTML tags) doesn't bother me.   


A small example:  


`.bg-black{ background-color: #000; }`

`.my-spefific-black-div { background-color: #000; }`

`.my-speficic-black-div-2 { background-color: #000; }`

The parent div would have display: flex, and that alone would position the elements as you described. Something like this:

&lt;div class=""flex-container""&gt;

&lt;div class=""flex-item grid-container""&gt;

If this floats it I don't know why he wouldn't be fine with me just using these as a way to float. 

So are these ID or Class Selectors where I can just add them to each paragraph or say something like this: 

Tables then float all of them to the right with one of those lines of code?

Or would I need to add them to each table and/or paragraph?

Sorry for the stupid questions but my teacher hasn't responded in 2 or 3 days now.",1.0
g3wycbl,ilsa97,"No need to apologize! If I'm understanding your question correctly, IDs and classes go inside an element like this: &lt;div id=""test-id"" class=""test-class""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

then in your css file (or within the html file inside style tags), you would write something like:

\#test-id {

background-color: blue;

}

.test-class {

background-color: red;

}

So if you write your html like I wrote out in my initial comment, and add the css properties I previously mentioned, that should help.

This answer will be similar to what u/knightmike2018 suggested, but it's worth it to learn the fundamentals. MDN in my opinion is one of the best resources to do that. Here is a [collection of CSS layout resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout). If you already know how to write semantic HTML, I would suggest you go through that page and attempt to recreate a layout of your choosing.

While at it, it doesn't hurt to learn about [CSS methodologies](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/css-methodologies/) and basic [build tools](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-preprocessors/) that will make life easier.

g3az8pw,iio87p,Could you please share how you did it in css ?,1.0
g3bzo4q,iio87p,"**Let's take the title reveal effect:**

That one I did in SVG with the &lt;animate&gt; tag - works similarly to keyframes in CSS but can animate any SVG attribute and was very useful in animating &lt;path&gt;s from one state to another. Which brings us to the SVG animation states. In order to get each one right, I traced each state in Affinity Designer, exported to SVG and checked, on every frame &amp; export, that the nodes were animated correctly by each browser. The SVG export options in Adobe Illustrator, Affinity and Inkscape work very differently, offered mixed results and they're not meant for animation really. I didn't know what I know now when I started, so a whole bunch of work I did on tracing was unusable for animation purposes. After a few hours of re-doing the trace for each state of the animation with all the kinks I had learned of, the title reveal was complete &amp; working.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now the CSS.**

The initial version had filters (saturate, brightness) animated for the background fade to red transition, but that proved sluggish on mobile browsers. So I replaced it with an overlay that goes from 0 to 0.75 in opacity. Boring, but got the job done without taking a toll on performance. Added background motion for a bit more ""life"" to the whole thing.

The Batman logo at the center has some filters &amp; scale animation, fairly straightforward stuff there.

And towards the end I got some dust &amp; scratches fading in over the title. Wanted to mix-blend-mode at first but was not necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff to google: for CSS &amp; animations there's always MDN and that's pretty standard stuff - it's up to you to combine them in way that makes sense and doesn't kill performance. For SVG I didn't find any tutorial on how to get this done easily, figured it out by myself after reading about &lt;animate&gt; (again on MDN). Trial &amp; error, wtf/min increased, that sorta thing. And performance is a bigger issue on SVG animations compared to regular elements - regardless of whether you apply them using CSS or &lt;animate&gt;, the more complex you make them the worse they'll behave, especially on mobile (Firefox, Safari, Chrome in that order).

Overall: I left the code unminified on the experiments on my site in case anyone wants to have a look at the source so it'll be there in case you're guys are curious about how it's all done.",1.0

If you're having trouble distinguishing them, it might be that you need more distance between those sizes in general.

Second, I'd only change the aesthetic between an h1, h2, h3, h4 specific to the component they inhabit, not globally. h5 and h6, maybe give them text-transform: uppercase or something if they have a niche use on your website. But h1-h4 I typically keep pretty basic across the site besides a size difference.

If for example, you need an h2 to accompany an h1 in the header area of your about page that is different than a typical h1-to-h2 association, then consider a modifier to your h2 by giving it a class like .about\_\_header--highlighted (this is BEM naming) and maybe give it a fun highlight.

Other embellishments might be:

* h2:before { content: ''; height: 20px; width: 250px; background-color: $color; } (a block of horizontal color above, left aligned to the text.
* border-left: 3px solid $color and a small amount of top/bottom padding

Imagine for example you have two very different components, but they both use the same shadow, you could have the shadow as a different class:

    .circle {
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;

    .box-shadow {
        box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);

And in your markup

    &lt;div class=""circle box-shadow""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""rectangle box-shadow""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Most notably, I'd say the rise in popularity of Tailwind.css is at least in part due to component reuse becoming more widespread - think of Blade, React, Vue, etc. If you're  going to write \`class=""user-card""\` just once in your entire codebase because it's a reusable component as declared in let's say some \`user-card-component.blade.php\`, you might as well put the styles right there (that's the logic, anyways).

Second of all there are several ways to achieve what you want to do. The easiest way would be to swap your positions around. You'll need \`position: relative\` in the parent container and \`position: absolute\` in the child container. Imagine \`position: relative\` creating a force field around the element and \`position: absolute\` is like turning the gravity off and that element just ends up bouncing around now inside the force field. That's how those two properties work.  


Another cool way if you decide give it a go is using \`margin-top: auto\` on the child container which create as much margin-top and PUSH your child element right down to the bottom. That's one I normally use as it means your content gets pushed further the more you add. It doesn't really with position absolute.

g2mj5q0,ifb6kb,"This is quite a broad question that has a few different answers depending on the exact situation.

To answer the question “Should you add animations with CSS?” *in general* then yes, you should. Why? Mainly because it’s a lot easier. Just one line can animate any CSS selector, and it’s written the same way as any other CSS. This is almost always easier than writing extra JavaScript for basic animating such as hover effects. This usually also translates to better performance.

Now, if you’re looking to do more complex animations then the answer becomes a lot more dependant on what you’re trying to achieve. For something like a click event, you can assign an event listener that just adds an animation class to an element, and this will apply an effect using CSS. For more complex animations you can use CSS keyframes.

JavaScript-heavy animating nowadays tends to be used for very complex animation sequences, and there’s a fair few libraries to help with this ranging from jQuery to timeline.js.

The above will cause some white space to appear between the LI elements as we're using inline-block styling (instead of float). One way to remove the white spacing, is to tweak the HTML code - ""mash"" the LI tags together. By mashing them together, most of the older browsers will then ""remove"" the white-spacing between the inline-blocks.

Why do you hide the navigation on desktop behind a button? That's not a good UX. I would remove the button and add anchors to the sidebar for navigation OR get the menu onto the screen and clearly indicate that the sidebar is not clickable. Clear hirachy what you should use to move around your site to not confuse the user.

The CTA button for me looks wrong. I would expect the ""cut"" on the other side of the button, but that's personal preference.

The hover animation on your three element feature section below the hero should have a transition time and not just appear/disappear. A nice touch would be to fill the bar above from the left depending on the item you hover.

A little bit more whitespace between the sections to visually divide them clearer.

Check your z-indexes. For me the projects are above the (empty) fixed top bar, the rest is below.

The Hire me CTA offset background to the right, is a little strange, considering you're using this red offset box to the left of the section headers.

You started pretty good, but then you got kinda confused with that padding, and the `align-items` property.

That's ok, you took your time and searched for a solution, you even used the browser's dev tools, even though you didn't realise what was the problem, it's great to see young people interested in web dev.

`align-items: stretch;` is the default, and what it does is simple, it stretches the items to fit the container. In your example it didn't work because your `.child` had `height: 100px;` 

Remove that `height` and you will see the default behaviour.

**Personal advice:**

Make sure you understand what you're teaching, only then try spreading your knowledge to others, because it matters a lot the quality of the information. We all make mistakes, but what you did there was no mistake, it was lack of knowledge on how certain things work in CSS.

g276czb,id6ni4,"To me, this article seems to have a pretty narrow and opinionated view.
Here's why:

Yes, class names decoupled from components creates problems. It's hard to know where a class is defined, whether it was overridden in certain cases elsewhere, or in certain contexts (e.g. `.JustThisScreen .Modal p`). It's easy to do CSS horribly, which is why CSSOM, BOM, etc. emerged.

This article seems to use these problems to justify a silver bullet solution, but styled components have their own problems:

It's hard to extract and server-render the CSS without a lot of complicated tooling and config.

Pseudo-classes and elements (`:hover, ::before, :empty`) become harder to use, and in many cases end up being solved with JS instead of CSS.
This really is a problem because it leads to inefficient code, doing redundant things, cluttering up a component.

The web tooling we have makes working with CSS much easier in stylesheets than in style attributes. If I want to play around styling something I can use the inspector, change a bunch of stuff, and just copy those styles straight back into a stylesheet.

I'm sure someone will write a VS Code extension to convert CSS into an object literal, but really? Do we need to complicate our lives like this?

On top of all of this, using the style attribute has the highest specificity of all, which can create problems with composition.

To me, [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) solved this problem years ago. That's really the end of it. It works well, it solves the problems BEM/CSSOM wanted to solve, it solves the dead styles problem, it lets you use your existing tools, and it's accessible to people that just want to write (and easily extract) some CSS.

g234dmk,ici1ib,"I'm a senior CSS professional. You have received some bad advice here. 

First, let me say unequivocally: do *not* use floats for layout purposes. For a long time, before Flexbox was a thing, it was the best tool we had. Flexbox removed the need for float-based layouts, and now you should just not use them anymore. That's not to say the float property doesn't still have a use. It does: to float an image to the left of paragraph text and have the text float around the image, for instance. That's what float was made for and what it should be used for. We just used to take advantage of its functionality to make layouts. Don't do that anymore. 

Flex and grid are both amazing tools. Grid definitely has a steeper learning curve than flex, but it is an immensely powerful tool. I've never seen a really good answer of when to use flex and when to use grid. I can't explain my thought process completely; I sort of just know it when I see it. But I think a good starting point is this:

""Can my layout be illustrated with sensible rows and columns? If yes, use grid. Or do I want my elements to flow and take up space? Use flex.""

My overall page layouts tend to use grid: 

    body {
        min-height: 100vh;
        margin: 0;
        grid-template-areas: ""header header""
            ""sidebar content""
            ""footer footer"";
        grid-template-columns: 30ch 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
    }

    .header {
        grid-area: header;
    }

    .sidebar {
        grid-area: sidebar;
    }

... etc.

Then I'll use flex for things like aligning my nav links vertically or for distributing items equally across the page or things like that. Grid can do a lot of the things that Flexbox can but grid can be a little overkill sometimes. However like I said, grid is an immensely powerful tool. The other use who said to use flexbox exclusively is doing you (and him/herself) a disservice.",6.0

The mismatch is due to the hard-coded width on the `.toc .toc-section-number` selector. The gaps would match if you were to remove that.

I'm not entirely clear on what you want to accomplish exactly. But to me it sounds like you want the top right column to be a static height, and the left and bottom right columns should be automatic, right? If the left column has a lot of items in a list, the top right column shouldn't be expanding too much right?

If this is the case, I've made a codepen [here](https://codepen.io/db1996/pen/JjXXPYo), Check out if that's kind of what you want. You need to give the top right a height (in my example, I've given it 50px) and make the bottom right column auto height.",2.0

Notes:

* I did away with using numbered grids, instead, I used named grids.
* I've specified the width of the first column and let the second column expand accordingly.
* I've not specified the height of the rows - letting the browser decide on that (it'll use the content)

g1bih9x,i8y58k,"**ELI5 answer**

The `flex-start/end` keywords are part of the **Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1** specification.

The `start/end` keywords are part of the **Box Alignment Module Level 3** specification.

The Box Alignment 3 spec simplified the grammar, allowing for an easier and less annoying use of properties and keywords.

**Example:**

The `gap` property that used to be `grid-gap`, worked only with **grid**, obviously.

Later they decided that they want the `gap` property for the **flexbox** as well, and instead adding the prefix like `flex-gap`, they simplified the things and went with `gap`, which is the shorthand for `row-gap` and `column-gap`

The only values of the `justify-content` property that are used now in flex layout are: `flex-start` (which is default), `center`, `flex-end`, `space-between`, and `space-around`.

**Edit:** This is how I understand flex, and I think I understand it quite well. CSS is very complicated, so I even don't try to understand things that don't work in the most popular web browsers.

Then Grid came along, and it was also huge, and they also had justify-content, but it didn't make sense in Grid for it to be ""flex-start"". So I believe the goal now is that eventually the grid syntax will work in flexbox (justify-content: start) but flex-start will probably always work too - they won't break it intentionally.

**Edit:** Why did you set every flex-item to be a flex container as well and every flex-item to grow 1? The `justify-content: space-between` makes no sense in that situation. There are many many things you just set display flex to them and wronlgy used the justify-content and other properties.

g1yd28u,i8rqua,"Sorry for taking a bit to reply, and I appreciate the feedback from you and /u/albedoa . I have updated my codepen with only the relevant code that I'm struggling with.

The code is actually part of a toggle switch I built, and there is actually another layer that goes on top that slides back and forth (but that part isn't relevant for this example).  For this example, there is text on both the left and right side and even though the text can have varying lengths on either side, both sides should expand to be the same width.  The problem in Example 1 on the codepen  is that if the text on both sides isn't the same length, the longer text wraps and doesn't look good.  In Example 2, if the text on both sides is the same length it will stay on the same line unless it exceeds the amount of space in its container.  I'm just trying to make it so that one side can have longer text without wrapping to the next line.

From what /u/albedoa stated, it seems that what I'm asking for isn't possible since the calculated width of one of the flex items would need to be dependent on another neighboring flex item.  I was just hoping for some ideas to solve this issue. :\\",1.0
g1yfzsx,i8rqua,"To help visualize *why* this isn't possible, consider a left-aligned container with two elements that behave as you desire them to. It sits on an otherwise blank document. Now imagine that the text in one item reaches the 50% mark such that the total container width is 100% of the page width. What happens when you add one more character to that item?

Or what happens if you have two inner elements `[__a__][abcde]` and you add `overflow: hidden;` to the right element? How does the container decide how wide it is? You might think the answers are obvious, but you are seeking those behaviors specifically, so of course they seem obvious. It's a more complicated problem than it seems.

You can use JavaScript to get the desired effect if you still want it: https://codepen.io/pigparlor/pen/jOqrxpB",1.0
g214x3c,i8rqua,"Thank you for your response.  Your explanation definitely makes sense.  

Unfortunately, the JavaScript method you suggested won't work for me because it assumes that the left side of the toggle will be the longest side always.  To give some perspective, this is a Vue component that will be reused on various pages and the text will be different on each page so the text will not always be longer just on the left side.

This did give me an idea though to calculate the width of both sides, check which is longer using Math.max(firstSideWidth, secondSideWidth), and then set the width for both sides to whichever is longer.

**Before you start, revert to how it was:**

Remove the `line-height`, that is not the problem, neither the solution.

Uncomment that width on the `img`, let it have `width: 100%;`, and uncomment the images in your html as well, to be able too se them.

**The solution to your problem:**

Add `height: 100%;` to `.project-tile`, in order to make it work, because if the height of the containing block is not specified, the value computes to `auto`. This is how Chrome and Safari resolves percentage heights. 

In Firefox it works without that height, but that's another story. Just add that height.

`height`, `width`, vertical `padding` and `margin` do not work with inline elements.",1.0

g0zpfl6,i73ht9,"There are two possible cases:

* Parent elements height is fixed and doesn't expand when you add content to it. In this case it's trivial to hard-code a vertical margin value, since you already know the fixed height. 
* Parent elements height is **not fixed** and expands when content is added to it. In this case, the child element and its margin will expand the parent elements height and thus also what 10% of this height is. We get an endless loop here - 
   * parents initial height is calculated,
   * childs margin takes 10% of it and expands the parent,
   * parents height is recalculated,
   * childs margin takes 10% of the new value,
   * repeat ad finitum

It's a bit of a simplification, but I don't see any good ways to implement an algorithm that would get to a satisfactory, precise value for the margin.

If we assume that there is a parent element with only one child in it, the problem boils down to this relation, which we can't continuously satisfy:

`parentHeight = childHeight + parentHeight / 10`  
We could say that  
`parentHeight = childHeight * 1.1;`  
That would leave us with a wrong calculation, because, if `childHeight = 10`, then  
`parentHeight = 10 * 1.1 = 11;`  
**But** this constraint doesn’t work anymore:  
`parentHeight = childHeight + parentHeight / 10 = 10 + 11 / 10 = 11,1 ≠ 11`

g0zqrwb,i73d2l,"You don't. Grid template area is a visual way to lay it out but it has its limitations and you can use other means.

https://cssgridgarden.com/",2.0
g0zra48,i73d2l,"Alright, thanks!",1.0
g106ru6,i73d2l,"In a nutshell, `grid-template-areas` is used for more complex grid layouts. You can usually get away with just `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` though. An example where I would use area:  

```
.myGrid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    ""icon, header, header""
    ""sidebar, mainContent, mainContent""
    ""sidebar, mainContent, mainContent""
    ""footer, footer, footer""
}
```",2.0
g81rup3,i73d2l,"`grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` are for defining the sizes of the explicit grid tracks (rows &amp; columns), and *optionally* naming any of the lines around those tracks.

For example here's a simple layout with a full-width header up top, followed by two split columns.

```css
.app {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: [header-start] 200px [header-end] 1fr;
  grid-template-columns: [header-start] 1fr 1fr [header-end];
}
```

This leaves us with a two column grid, where the left-most column line is named `header-start` and the right-most column line is named `header-end`. Also the top-most row line is named `header-start` and the second (middle) row line is named `header-end`.

It can be visualized [like this](https://content.screencast.com/users/geddesign/folders/Snagit/media/72655105-2a01-40e0-996e-a5e397ad9cb0/2020-10-07_16-05-52.png).

## positioning using grid lines

Naming grid lines now allows you to position grid items into the grid at specific locations. Now we can place the `.header` div on those named grid lines:

```css
.header {
  grid-row-start: header-start;
  grid-row-end: header-end;
  grid-column-start: header-start;
  grid-column-end: header-end;
}
```
[codepen example up to this point](https://codepen.io/geddski/pen/bGeGKvL)

## grid-template-areas

Naming every grid line individually can be a pain. So `grid-template-areas` is essentially just a shortcut for easily naming a bunch of grid lines all at once.

We can change the example to this:

```css
.app {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-areas: ""header header""
                       "". ."";
}
```

This code is identical to the original, because `grid-template-areas` is smart and automatically expands the names you give it, adding `-start` and `-end` to the area names.

So the header is still positioned in the correct spot!
[codepen example up to this point](https://codepen.io/geddski/pen/bGeGKjv)

## grid-row &amp; grid-column shorthands

Positioning grid items by named grid lines can also be a pain, but lucky for us there are also shortcuts for this! `grid-row` is a shortcut for `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end`. Likewise for `grid-column`.

We can shorten our positioning then to this:

```css
.header {
  grid-row: header-start / header-end;
  grid-column: header-start / header-end;
}
```
[codepen example up to this point](https://codepen.io/geddski/pen/RwRwJeV)

This is still a bit verbose. Grid positioning lets you leave off the `-start` and `-end` parts of the grid lines so long as the first part of the name matches. So we can shorten this further to this:

```css
.header {
  grid-row: header / header;
  grid-column: header / header;
}
```
[codepen example up to this point](https://codepen.io/geddski/pen/GRqRGPM)

## grid-area shorthands

Getting lots better! Now there's one final shorthand we can use. `grid-area` is a shorthand for both `grid-row` and `grid-column`. We can shorten our positioning to just this:

```css
.header {
  grid-area: header / header / header / header;
}
```

And finally, like other CSS properties (`padding`,`margin`,etc) if multiple values are the **same**, we can just specify it once and it will apply it to them all. So we can shorten the positioning down to only this:

```css
.header {
  grid-area: header;
}
```

g0zwrvj,i731oa,"**Edit:** I misread your question, but all of the information below still applies.

**Edited answer:** 

`margin: auto` applies only to the flex item, you can use this as an alternative when you're trying to center a single item.

When you have more than a single item you might want to use `justify-content: center;` and `align-items: center;` instead of `margin: auto;`

In order for `margin: 0 auto;` to work, it must be a `block-level` element and it must have a `width`, in case it's a `flex-level` element (flex item), a fixed width is not required, even though a flex item is not a `block-level` element, the display value of the flex item is **blockified**.

On the other hand, `justify-content: center;` will center the content inside the flex container, without specifying a width for the content.

If the direction of the flex is changed to `column`, then `align-items: center;` will center the items horizontally.",2.0

&lt;span class=""scribble-replace""&gt;the one,&lt;span&gt;mother&lt;/span&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=""scribble-replace""&gt;who should&lt;span&gt;fucking&lt;/span&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=""scribble-replace""&gt;not be named&lt;span&gt;Voldemort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
```

If you do not use ```no-wrap```, you have the issue that the original text might spill into the next line while the scribble does not.

As this becomes cumbersome and confusing with increasing string length, I would suggest writing a component for it, if you have a lot of long strings needing replacement. While you're at it, you could also randomize the rotation, placement, etc. of the scribbles a little to make it look more organic.

You need to make sure that your two input strings are about the same length and that your algorithms does not have to replace a long word (e. g. a made up German compound word ""Schifffarthskapitänsmützenschildbedruckungsschritgrößenoptionen"") with a word of different length (e. g. ""I"") as algorithms cannot have the human ingenuity of scribbling wherever there is a suitable place. (except theoretically with the magic of AI)

I find if its a little thing (such as a badge on an icon) that doesn't want to change responsively then I'll use `px`

g0jlw0t,i4kxmm,Also VMIN and VMAX for certain rare situations,5.0
g0jlw2b,i4kxmm,"I avoid using `vh` for the simple reason that mobile browsers behave differently in regards to that unit. The two major players: iOS Safari and Android Chrome have a vastly different implementation of this unit. For example: it will not reflect the current viewport height on Safari, but rather the overall maximum height the viewport can achieve in the current orientation, but a `100vh` element will be obstructed by browser toolbar and address bar when visible. Chrome does react to these changes but will disregard on-screen keyboard, just as Safari does, however `window.innerHeight` will change on Chrome when the keyboard comes up as well as trigger a `resize` event while on Safari it does not.

In conclusion you should be smart about layouts in a way that allows you to disregard the actual screen size, so that your layout will look good regardless of the available screen real-estate.

Personally I would fall back to either % if you want something more traditional, or set up ad-hoc grid systems with corresponding breakpoints so you have something like 3+ columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile. Set up your components so they fill whatever space they are placed in. Responsiveness is also a matter of what devices are used to browse your site, do you have data on that?

I am very weary of using px for sizing of anything responsive, cause it makes me feel like I'm forcing things. I would only use px for max min widths and maybe forcing an image size, but definitely not to build a grid. At the very least, if you do, make sure you have a part of your layout that adapts to however much empty space is left once the px sizes are defined. Still not the most elegant solution but there are use cases.

Also in general you're better off worrying about width rather than height. Width is also easier to control from CSS. Web pages can have infinite height, the bottleneck is always the screen width. I've never used vh/vw except forcing full pages for splash screens on mobile and things like that.",1.0

First, what you are describing here is using `&lt;span&gt;`s as *containers* of inline elements (and as containers of containers of inline elements).

    &lt;p&gt;This paragraph contains a &lt;span class=""highlight""&gt;highlighted&lt;/span&gt; word.&lt;/p&gt;

and this:

    &lt;span&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;This is some inline text.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;This is some more inline text.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;

The latter is harmless but not good practice. From MDN:

&gt; It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.

g0dntu5,i3lxyj,"Okay but like noone is going to mention why this is happening and how to achieve that effect properly without making other people potentially want to gouge their eyes out? Okay here goes:

Whether you're using a heading element (h1, h2, etc.) or using a div to wrap the text, the element containing the text is a *block level element* which means it will take up it's own row (i.e. be as wide as it's parent). Couple that with your font size causing wrapping and that explains why you're seeing your element take up two rows with all that empty space on the right side.

The opposite of a block level element is an *inline element* (e.g. img or span) which is only as wide as it's content and lets other elements take up space next to it. You _could_ set the display property of the element to inline and then give it some padding (this is how you'd handle a link for example) but I doubt you want that.

My suggestion is to make the parent element a flex container and set it's flex direction to vertical and align-items to flex start. All flex children in that container will now be as wide as their content and will be left aligned and stacked on top of each other. Give your container a max width or set it to the width of it's parent and now you have a reusable element that can be used throughout your project rather than making a messing up all headings in your project, or making a class that's only going to be used once in your project.

There is no need to mess with width, max width, min width, or anything to that effect when you're dealing with dynamic content. Let the browser make the decisions it needs to make.",11.0

g08cknk,i31007,"Hey there! I struggled with CSS when I first started learning it, but now it’s one of my favorite languages. Just a couple quick comments below: 

1) you’ll want to style the element directly in CSS - currently the align=center bit in your code is an HTML attribute. To use CSS, you can add a class name to the form element (i.e: &lt;form class=“your-class-name”), then style it directly in the CSS file (i.e: .your-class-name {styles go here}). 

2) I’d personally use a &lt;div&gt; element for the wrapper instead of a form, unless there’s a specific reason you’d want to use a form. Either way, here’s an example I found that shows what I described above:

Without looking, my thought is that you May be using align:center the class, which may or may not work specifically based on how you have it structured. I would suggest, if you haven’t already, look into flexbox for positioning inline elements! 

In short, flex consists of setting the parent container with the items you want to manipulate to “display:flex” then informing how you want these items within the container to appear (justify content, align items, flex direction, etc).

That's true--the containers are all equal height now.  But the height of the columns seems way too tall now.  If I now convert each column to flex and align the buttons, it will will result in those buttons aligned at the very *bottom* of each column--correct?  If so, that will be undesirable--the buttons will be too far down the column and there will be too much dead space in the middle of the column ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/9LGGApH.jpeg)).

Spit-balling here, but I'd probably set the image as the container bg. I'd make the soft white bar thing with a `::after` pseudo element sized and positioned however you need it. Then for your heading and content, I'm not sure. Probably just set opacity to 0 on anything you want to hide. You could also transform scale to 0, but that'll look a little weird when it transitions in to 100%.

Anyway, your css selectors would look something like this:

```
.container:hover::after {}
.container:hover h2 {}
.container:hover .content {}
```

For the `after`, you're gonna transform the scale to 100% to fill the space. For the `h2` (or whatever you're using for your heading), you could transition the `top` to move it up and make room for content (if necessary). Then for the `.content`, you transition that however you see fit depending on how you hid it to start (fade in, slide in from outside the container [requires `overflow: hidden` on container], etc.).

All that said, I think you might be able to animate certain things in a flex container, so in theory, maybe you don't need to position your h2 to center it or move it out of the way of your content. Maybe you just center it with flex, then on hover your content expands and the heading pushes it up naturally. I can't remember for sure if to that's possible, but it'd be it cool.

There is a caveat. Some people say you should only ever animate a select list of properties due to performance issues so there may be some tradeoffs here.

More pseudo-classes, we already got the useful `:not()`, the soon to have more support `:where()` and also `:is()`, the difference between `:is()` and `:where()` is that `:where()` always has `0` specificity.

The CSS `attr()` function will have more support soon, other than being used only as a value for the `content` property.

\- missing `[attr^=value]`, `[attr$=value]` etc.

**Important combinator missing:**

\- missing the general sibling combinator `a ~ b`

**Important pseudo-classes missing:**

\- `:last-child`, `:nth-child()`, `:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type`, `:nth-of-type()`, `:not()` etc.

**Important pseudo-elements missing:**

`::before`, `::after`

**Important units missing:**

`rem`, `vh`, `vw`, `vmin`, `vmax`

**&lt;color&gt; data types are NOT ""units"", anyway, the list is missing this important color model:**

`hsl()`

**Important background properties missing:**

`background-size`, `background-origin`, `background-clip`

Not to mention that some of them are **shorthands** and people that are new to CSS won't know that, usually they don't know what a shorthand is and what syntax they might have.

For example, `background` is the shorthand for: `background-clip`, `background-color`, `background-image`, `background-origin`, `background-position`, `background-repeat`, `background-size`, and `background-attachment`

Many useless things are included, most of them they don't belong in the categories they've been put in and the most important ones do not exist, such as **flexbox**, **grid**, that's because the cheat sheet is very old, besides being poorly made.

You go from padding zero to that.

Also, semantically, you should only be using one nav tag for your navigation. I would recommend wrapping top and bottom navs in the nav tag, and have them separated by divs.


*edit the cause of the top nav sizing is due to padding, not font size as another poster suggested. [Here's a gif](https://imgur.com/WvlzRNN) showing you how the issue is happening.

""A document may have several &lt;nav&gt; elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for intra-page navigation. aria-labelledby can be used in such case to promote accessibility, see example.""
 I still disagree with the usage. If those navs were spread out around the page in different elements it would be one thing. But the way the page is laid out it presents as a single nav element visually, presenting a different experience for people using screen readers vs people browsing visually.",1.0
fz0kken,hwlzk4,"Sorry, original answer wasn't focused on the question.

The difference between the two pages is that your GET IN TOUCH button's font size is not scaling down, and so the button is not getting smaller and allowing space for the links.

In fact, the same thing is happening on all the other pages except Home. Home is the only one where the button is scaling down.

The error is somewhere in the solutions.css file (or scss file in this case), which is included after the main.css file and is overriding it on each of those three pages, but isn't present on the home page.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Original answer:

I tried gradually scaling down from a large size on the link you have put up here.

The issue is firstly that the GET IN TOUCH button takes way too long to scale down as I resize the window thinner, leading to instances of cramped links.

Secondly, even after the button resizes itself, the links still cramp up if the window width is sufficiently thin.

The main problem seems to be the margins or paddings, probably both in the link container as well as the button. You'd want to experiment with changing the margins and paddings to a lower value at set breakpoints, or make them responsive somehow ( such as calc(0.5rem + 1vw) or something).

Anyway, your breakpoint where the get in touch button shrink seems to be around 808 pixels, but by then the buttons have already cramped up. So make the breakoint above that threshold, and at the same breakpoint, also reduce the minimum required margins/paddings on the links.

That's my suggestion, anyway.",2.0
fz2223c,hwlzk4,"Thank you for the feed back, what I decided to do instead was just make 808 the breakpoint where I show the menu. I’ve been trying to crack the problem all day and have been getting no where, just a real frustrating day as now I’m having another issue",2.0

fz1z5c6,hwie1e,"Quick question on your third card i see that it is larger than the other two ,almost double the size, despite having specified ***Flex:1*** in the card class.

According to what i'm seeing, \*'\****flex: 1'*** tells the flex items to be the same size regardless off content, so i'm puzzled as to why the third card is almost double the size, despite having the same exact styling as the other cards?",1.0
fz2jzn2,hwie1e,"Resize the preview window in there and you will notice that all of them will be on the same row and same size.

I set the `.card` to have a minimum width of 300px, the flexbox `.container` has `flex-wrap: wrap;` set to it, so when there is no more available space for the 3 of them to fit together, they wrap (fall below each other).

`.card` has `flex: 1;` meaning that they fill the available space, when that space is smaller than the minimum space of all 3 of them to fit on one row, then they will wrap.

To make this easier to understand, if we remove the margins and borders, all 3 of them take exactly 900px to fit on one row, because I set the card's minimum width to be 300px. If we resize the window to 899, the 3rd card will fall below, and will take the available space, and so on when it reaches 599px, they will all be below each other.

If you don't like the cards taking the available space when they fall below each other, you can set the value of flex to 0 1, like so `flex: 0 1;`

If you don't want to use `min-width` on the card and use `flex-basis` for the card's inital width, you simply write for example: `flex: 1 1 300px;`

**Edit:**  `flex: 1;` is the shorthand for `flex-grow: 1;`, `flex-shrink: 1`; and `flex-basis: 0%;`",2.0
fz0hdsc,hwie1e,"I think this is commonly called a ""Card"", and it's in bootstrap as well with the same name.

Anyways, if you want to do this using plain css, you just need this sort of a structure (or perhaps you could simplify it even more if you wanted):

&amp;#x200B;

    &lt;div class=""card""&gt;
    
        &lt;div class=""card_image_container""&gt;
            &lt;image/&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
        &lt;div class=""card_heading_container""&gt;
            &lt;h3 class=""card_heading""&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
        &lt;div class=""card_text_container""&gt;
            &lt;p class=""card_text""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;/div&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

In the CSS, you'd set the class card to be a flexbox, and set it's flex direction to column, and maybe align-items to center. You'd probably also set the size of the card\_image\_container class in some way, and set the size of the img in a card to 100% width or however you want to make it somewhat responsive.

Finally, you'll have to tinker with the heading and text directly and/or their containers to get it to look just how you want. You might also add a border to the card as a whole to make it look more like the cards in the screenshot.

Of course, this is the starting structure. You may add more complexity and inner divs as you go along when you add links, or meta tag containers which contain date, author, etc. and so on.",1.0

Endless scrolling is great if everyone is mostly interested in what's happening right now, and anything a week old is long since consigned to the history books, but it totally breaks down if that's not the case, especially when combined with the typical timeline model that doesn't offer anything besides the endless scrolling, or a crappy search feature, to try to find things.

It throws away what makes tech special.  It can be predictable.  It can take the responsibility to keep up away from the people, and put it on a machine where the work only has to be done once and then deployed.


But everyone has this ""Journey not the destination"" and ""Life is about flow"" kind of attitude, and they don't want anything to be predictable, stable, or reliable, because you're supposed to rely on yourself instead, and you're supposed to live for the moment and the next big thing or innovation and not really care what was posted a year ago.

Endless scrolling just seems inseparable from  a specific worldview, which might be fine for Instagram, but not for general purpose tech that gets used in places where people have different expectations.



I'd prefer one step further, where pages are actually based on time, and fully static, even if older stuff gets deleted, or at least partially based on time, but in practice, you can generally trust that the same stuff will be within a few pages of where it used to be, for at least a few months.",7.0

Anyways, I'm reading up on google material design these days, and I saw [something interesting](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html) regarding this. They like to generally keep margins and gutter widths fixed or static between breakpoints (the `@media` queries), and only the columns (or I guess content containers in this case) scales smoothly with the width of the page.

So I guess in the long term it may be better to develop a methodology to change some values like margins only at predetermined breakpoints, but make the containers for the actual content highly responsive using `%`, `vw` or any other similar mechanism.

I agree with the person who said you’ll be using both in certain cases. I think it’s a matter of relative/absolute. Maybe fluid/fixed. But grid and device size aside, the additional factor I can think to take in mind (and I bet there’s more) is zoom in/out",2.0

fyvodf0,hun0rl,"Thanks. Actually there is a difference. I like to nest the input in the label so that there is only one root. This only comes into play when you introduce flex or grid on the parent container. Having a single root makes things more predictable than having two siblings. You would need to wrap them in another div.

As for including the ID or not, I address that in the accessibility article. I used to think it was the same, but it's not. An explicit label (using ID) is more accessible for certain assistive technology. Some do not support implicit labels (wrapped label without ID). 

Long story short, both the wrapping and ID are deliberate decisions. I'd say the wrap is optional, but the ID is necessary if you want to be more accessible.",1.0

fytltav,hu9uwh,"It's because the images are too big to work with that CSS. Your theme seems to be adding this to all images: `max-width: 100%; height: auto;` . It makes the images fill their parent element up to the maximum width of each image. I also happened to use the same CSS in my example because I knew that all the images were `120px` wide, so they would never fill the container.

In your case the images are pretty huge, so for them to look close to what you need, you need to set a static `max-width` to the images... Or resize the images in a photo editor. That would honestly be for the best in terms of load times, but if you want to keep the edits in the CSS, then something like:

    .wrap img {  
      max-width: 186px;
      height: auto;
      margin: 20px;

fyts3mz,hu9uwh,"Yea, images typically flow similar to how text flows. Why you can only fit 3 images in one row has to do with the parent elements and viewport (browser window) too, to some extent.

This is not exactly related to the issue per se, but if you imagine that you placed these images in a blank document, the viewport (browser) width would be the thing defining the maximum width... Which is to say, if your viewport is 1000px and your images are all 120px wide, assuming they have no added padding, margin, or borders, the browser would be able to fit 8 images in one row... Now if you were to resize the browser window to 1000px, you'd be able to fit 4 images in one row. So that is also something to consider...

Back to the actual issue. The `.wrap` element is inside a bunch of other elements that constrict it to a certain width.

More specifically, it's inside `.grid__item`, that has `left: 8.33333%;` which offsets it a little and `padding-left: 30px;` that again offsets it a little and `width: 83.33333%;` that constricts whatever is inside it to that width.

And going up further, they are both inside `.page-width` and it has `max-width: 1200px;` and `padding-left: 55px; padding-right: 55px;`.

My advice would be to get rid of these html elements: `.grid` and .`grid__item`. That would probably be enough.

Note that you can pretty easily see these things with your browsers built-in inspector. This video talks about the inspector in Chrome's dev tools, but Firefox has it too: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs63yeOkT3I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs63yeOkT3I) \- When you hover over html elements or certain CSS, you may see the website get these light blue, green, and orange overlays... They are really useful. You can peek at the `Computed` tab on the right to see what the colors mean.

When I inspected the website I put my mouse over the html starting from `.wrap` and then went up element by element hovering over each one (you can also use arrow up). I did that for as long as it took me to find the last parent element that doesn't take up the full viewport. That tells me that the issue is somewhere between `.main-content` and `.wrap`. And while those color overlays that I mentioned are what told me which elements don't take up the full width... You can see if they have margin or padding pretty easily in the overlays, but you have to look at the css styles on the right to see if the elements have set width. If you search for ""width"" using the filter input you can then easily go through all those elements without having to scroll up and down looking for the width value in each element.",1.0

fyu11tx,hu9uwh,"Yea, and if the page was a clean slate with no extra elements and css to worry about, the way you would make sure the maximum row length is 3, is by adding  max width to `.wrap` that takes into account the maximum width of the images and any possible horizontal margins or padding.

It's just simple math. if the max width on `.wrap` is 1000px, you can make the max width of the images: 1000/3 = ~330px and if you add 10px margins around each image, the max width should be: 330-(10 * 2) = 310px. 10px * 2 because I'm assuming you'd have the same margin on all sides.

fykajyz,htlkox,"You need an id or a very specific and unique class name to target a single, specific element.

Having said that, look at the immediate parent. It's got a complicated class name, with the ""770e932"". And with the data-id field having the same number, it suggests to me that this is going to be a unique class name which won't be repeated elsewhere. So you can try putting this in your css file and see if it works:

&amp;#x200B;

    .elementor-element-770e932 &gt; .elementor-column-wrap.elementor-element-populated {
        padding-left: 0px!important;
    }

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't seem like the parent container, the 770e932 one, has multiple elements with this class structure inside it, so it should be fine. If not, you may have to look into the :nth-of-type() psuedo class as well.

The ""!important"" will just make it override any other styles by force, and help with testing. If it works, you can then try without the ""!important"" part.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Looks like we can also select elements based on attributes. This is another way to try the above in case the previous doesn't work:

    [data-id=""770e932""] &gt; .elementor-column-wrap.elementor-element-populated {
        padding-left: 0px!important;

Hey man, I tried your code out and it works brilliantly! So thanks for that. The only issue I have is that I need to repeat this CSS numerous times because each number eg. 770e932 is a different product.

Would you happen to know of a way of applying this CSS without having to specify the product number?

Thanks!",1.0
fyqag7w,htlkox,"Great to know!

(Note: I just noticed that you say you can add a class name to one of the parent classes. If so, please check out my other comment and see if that applies to your case.)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Would you happen to know of a way of applying this CSS without having to specify the product number?

If the products are more or less identical in terms of html structure and css attributes, and only their data-id or class is different with respect to that one number, then unfortunately you'll have to list those out somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you want you can still compress your CSS to make it less repetitive. To start off, you could try this in your CSS (the last selector shouldn't have a comma)

    [data-id=""770e932""] &gt; .elementor-column-wrap.elementor-element-populated,
    [data-id=""111111""] &gt; .elementor-column-wrap.elementor-element-populated,
    [data-id=""222222""] &gt; .elementor-column-wrap.elementor-element-populated {
        padding-left: 0px!important;
    }

Unfortunately, I can't think of a way the rest of the above selector won't have to be repeated without using SASS or the like.

&amp;#x200B;

But having said that, if you are sure the html structure of every product that you are selecting is the same (only one important div inside the div with the data-id), and only their ID is different, you could also this:

    [data-id=""770e932""] &gt; div,
    [data-id=""111111""] &gt; div,
    [data-id=""222222""] &gt; div {
        padding-left: 0px!important;
    }

You'll still end up specifying each product since it is otherwise identical, but your CSS should be a little lighter and easier to deal with.

Maybe I could have come up with something if I knew woocommerce. Hopefully I'll learn it in the future and know how to deal with this.",2.0
fyqbicp,htlkox,"I just noticed, you mentioned you can add a class name to one of the parent classes.

If that is the case, you could add that class name to that one parent for every product where you want the padding to be removed. Then you could do something like this:

    .classlivesmatter .elementor-column-wrap.elementor-element-populated {
        padding-left: 0px!important;
    }

&amp;#x200B;

Or you could even try this, which is a little riskier but works if your HTML structure doesn't change between the products you select and you don't care about the left padding value on the intermediary containers or other containers within .classlivesmatter, such as the view more and buy now buttons:

    .classlivesmatter div {
        padding-left: 0px!important;
    }

&amp;#x200B;

In either case, you won't have to specify each product ID, but you will have to add .classlivesmatter to that one parent container for each product you want the padding to be removed for.

Hey man, just want to update you that this worked perfectly! Thank you! I learnt something new today via your CSS code :)

fys4kgm,htlkox,"&gt;Hey man, just want to update you that this worked perfectly! Thank you! I learnt something new today via your CSS code :)

Glad I could help! And that increases my confidence by 3000%.

&amp;#x200B;

"".one.two"" means CSS will target elements which have both, class ""one"" and also class ""two"" applied to them, eg:

    &lt;div class=""one two""&gt;I am the target&lt;/div&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

"".one .two"" with  the space in between means that CSS will target an element with class ""two"" which is a DESCENDANT of an element with class ""one"", eg:

    &lt;div class=""one""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""two""&gt;I am the target&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

So space is how CSS differentiates whether you are talking about an element with a class name of ""one"" and it's descendant with a class name of ""two"", or if you are talking about a single element with the classes ""one"" and ""two"" both applied to that same element.

&amp;#x200B;

In our case, the target div had both the classes ""elementor-column-wrap"" as well as ""elementor-element-populated"" applied to it, so we had to add both of them without a space.

Otherwise, if we had put a space between the two, CSS would look first for an element with class ""elemenor-column-wrap"" and probably find our target box, but instead of selecting it, it would then look INSIDE it for an element with class ""elementor-element-populated"", and that would not have worked.",2.0

&gt;It's easy to look at this approach and think it's just like throwing style tags on your HTML elements and adding whatever properties you need, but in my experience it's very different.

&gt; With inline styles, there are no constraints on what values you choose.

&gt; One tag could be font-size: 14px, another could be font-size: 13px, another could be font-size: .9em, and another could be font-size: .85rem.

&gt; It's the same blank canvas problem you face when writing new CSS for every new component.

&gt; Utilities force you to choose:

&gt; Is this text-sm or text-xs?

&gt; Should I use py-3 or py-4?

&gt; Do I want text-dark-soft or text-dark-faint?

&gt; You can't just pick any value want; you have to choose from a curated list.

Making a good layout is more than its ability to scale on every screen size, it's about composition, what stays and what gets removed on certain breakpoints, either to keep it clean and readable, either to remove and add things that on certain screen sizes won't make much sense.

Keep in mind you still need to have a good and intuitive design that works well on most cases, achieving perfection is close to impossible.

1400px - standard content width - smaller desktop screens
1100px - tablets - landscape

Everybody is happy to use flexbox and grid and not rely on floats and other hacks for layouts.

Flexbox is actually not that new, browsers had support for it for quite a while, every browser supports it and it's the standard for layouts along the css grid.

There are 0 reasons to work using the old methods.

**Edit:** Microsoft will end IE11's support in 2025, they already made it clear that supporting an old browser is not the way, that's why Edge is now available for everyone, it even works on Windows 7, which its support ended this year.

It tend to create unnecessarily complex selectors because it feels easier to read for the dev. You shouldn't map the html structure in it either, since you wouldn't do that in CSS.

My suggestion is if you will learn SCSS, to write pure CSS first, and simplify it later with SCSS.

As you said, CSS3 now have variables, so use that and not SCSS variables.

Nesting selectors is a double edged sword, my ruel for my team is to keep a nest no longer than a screen height in the editor. This makes it more comprehensive. If you need it longer, you probably making a mistake anyway. There are exceptions ofcourse.

Mixins in my opinion are cost more than what they saves, if you use them, use a library instead of inventing them for yourself, but I suggest to avoid them altogether. It doesn't mean you shouldn't understand them.

fy2yast,hpwiwu,I've been using scss for years now and worked with dozens of apps. This week I started converting my current scss library to plain old CSS because I'm not seeing the value anymore. The fact that you can change variables in CSS at run time is AMAZING to me :),1.0
fxuems3,hpwiwu,"Obviously anything you do in scss can be done through CSS but scss makes it easier. To be able to create functions, mixins, loops, nesting etc and keep it all within a nice clean workable file structure that at the end you can compile together and minify just makes it easier to work with.

CSS variables aren't well supported on IE so that rules out using those so you need to use sass variables.

When paired with things like webpack you can auto prefill your CSS so you don't need to have to have mixins for everything that needs a prefix, you can just write the normal CSS and it will fill in everything that you might be missing",1.0

\- Using a combination of `appearance: none` and `input[type=checkbox]:before` you can make clickable elements that maintain their own state without looking like checkboxes.

\- Putting an input in a div that has `overflow: hidden` and using a transition you can make elements that are only clickable some of the time.

\- Using a sibling selector (`~` or `+`) with a checkbox's `:checked` to control `animation-play-state` you can start and stop timers in plain CSS. By also applying `pointer-events: none` to the checkout when it's checked you can make it so the user can't uncheck it.

One of those files is Bear.css written specially for Bear by Brett Tepstra

When the Bear note is displayed in Marked, for each Bear note format there is a Marked2 equivalent thanks to Bear.css. Bold is Bold, italics is italics etc

There is only one problem: Bear.css does not contain a counterpart for ::marker::. which I think should look like the usual highlighted text (yellow background in the Marked2 rendering).  I wrote to the developer who was very nice, but did not have time to modify the code. He told me succinctly:

You would need to convert ::marker:: to a &lt;mark&gt; tag or a block tag.

&gt; 1. people who don’t want to learn CSS

I heard this statement from a lot of folks (mainly those who didn't really try Tailwind yet) and I honestly 100% don't get it. Unlike Bootstrap, Ant or other frameworks/systems, you use actual low-level CSS if you're writing Tailwind and absolutely need to know how it works? If you don't know flexbox, those `flex` classes will mean nothing to you. If you don't know positioning a `.relative` class is absolutely worthless to you. Same goes for literally 98% of CSS and, respectively, Tailwind classes. Afaik `.container` is the only ""component"" that comes with Tailwind as of now, everything else is just plain old 1:1 CSS. Sure, you'll use a slightly different syntax for media queries (`size:classname`), pseudo classes (`hover:classname`) and combinators (`group` and `group-hover:classname`) but that's about it.

&gt; An API on top of an API

Yeah, well, that's how libraries and abstractions work, no matter if that's React, WordPress, Lodash, Vue, Laravel or Tailwind. They always come with trade-offs but for all the ones I listed a lot of people seem to think they're worth it. :)

&gt; The current Tailwind utilities.css file is 1.8 megabyte and contains 80 000 lines of code.

Tailwind includes PurgeCSS by default, you just need to turn it on. And it's automatically configured in a safe way where it doesn't touch any of your custom classes, only the ones generated by Tailwind. My CSS is 4kb and the classes in my HTML gzip like there's no tomorrow. :)

&gt; But let’s just imagine you have a bit of a bigger project [...]. And you now realize that there are 7 variants of your button in your codebase

Ehm, if you have a bigger project and don't use any form of components or template partials (like the Tailwind docs helpfully recommend) to handle common interface elements, that mess is 100% on you.

**Warning:** This will remove the header of its normal flow, making all the content that was below it to move up like the header it's not even there.

To fix this you can add a `margin-top` to the **section below the header**, this will make the header move down as well, because the new top is changed through the margin, to fix this, you need to add `top: 0;` **on the header**.

For better results on how much margin-top to add to the section below the header, you can add a height to the header, using css variables would be a wise choice here, but you can hardcode it as well, no problem.

**Example:**

    :root {
    --header-height: 80px;

    #header {
    height: var(--header-height); /* you can add the number here instead of the variable if you want no variables.*/ }
    
    #below-header-section {
    margin-top: var(--header-height); /* or just add the number, which in our case is 80px */

&gt; And wrapping &lt;div&gt; around &lt;div&gt; after &lt;div&gt; just seems like poor workflow.

This indicates to me that you have the wrong mental model. Take a look at this webpage for instance. How many elements do you think there are compared to elements you can see? After you register a guess, open up the inspector to get an idea of the correct answer. How far off were you?

Here is [the definition of `&lt;div&gt;` from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div):

&gt; The **HTML Content Division element** (**`&lt;div&gt;`**) is the generic container for flow content.

It's a generic container. Containing things in a generic (non-semantic) way is what it does. If you start looking at markup as a series of containers that present content instead of a dump of content that needs to be wrangled into place by containers, it starts to make a lot more sense. (If you work with React or another component-based framework, a similar concept is [presentational versus container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0). Since you are comfortable with JavaScript, maybe this will help it click.)

Now rephrase your statement as an analogy using our new mental model:

&gt; And holding your water in a glass that sits on a kitchen island that is secured in place by a floor just seems like poor workflow.

That looks funny, right? It is literally the job of the floor, the kitchen island, and the glass to hold the things they are holding. If it weren't for any one of them, you would be left with some sort of mess.

* the ""cascadiness"" - that styles inherit and it's not always clear what you've inherited. Always use some code at the beginning of your CSS to wipe defaults, so you can explicitly control your styles.   [For example](https://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/)
* getting used to selectors: use [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).  When I was starting out, I found it very easy to use the wrong selector, and spend several minutes wondering whether my changes were badly built.  They usually weren't badly build .. just badly ""aimed"";  i.e. applied to the wrong set of objects and therefore often invisible.
* getting used to styling whole sets of objects, not just single objects. It is uncommon that you'll ever want to style single elements in your page. Usually you're styling populations of elements, even if there's only one such actual element in your page. You might edit your page later and add ten more. Who knows?  The point is, you won't have to rewrite your CSS if you do.
* the organic nature of the page - a WYSIWYG editor might skew your perception of what's going on in the CSS. It's not a grid, where you place a 2x2 widget here and a 3x1 widget there. Instead, a webpage is more elastic, so you have to fill to expand the space of the page. Normally you fill the width first, then down the page, because that's how English text works. If you're getting stuck with your layouts, try changing the background to pink to make it super obvious if your layout is expanding to fill the page as you expect it to.

First of all I start my designs from top and move towards bottom. While doing that, I divide each section with a div (or section) tag, and assign width: 100% to those sections.   


Next, if I want a two column on that section, or three, or five, or whatever, I make enough divs for that and assign them a class, named ""sec-1-column"" or whatever you are okay with. Then I assign the width for that class so I have my columns. If I need a single column, I still make that div named sec-1-column because it is easier to position an element relative to its parent div, then positioning it to relative to the whole page.

There is a weird misconception in the web world that everyone needs to know everything. I would rather work with a good front end engineer than someone who tries to do everything and is not as good.

As for CSS being ""artsy"", I don't get your critique. Yes it is about presentation and there are not as many rules because layout and style is more about taste and touch.
It's not a black and white world where you can clearly say something is better.

You seem to have a low understanding of html and CSS and that is ok for a beginner but you have to understand that the mixing of different display and positioning modes is how you work here. They are combined to accomplish what you want and it is no easy task to make your own original layouts and designs, I have worked with it for 10 years and still struggle at times.

As for visual layout tools, that road as others mentioned has been tried and it has not yielded any good results yet. Web is a far more complex medium than 2d graphics and you have to account for all the interactions the user has with the page and all different devices that they use. It becomes unwieldy after a while. It's always good to start with pen and paper and then a drawing program to guide you as you construct the CSS but you have to learn and get a feeling for how things are done.",3.0

'Artsy' is definitely not a good word to have chosen.  I was thinking more 'magic' or 'not sciency' in reference to knowing what you're going to get, mainly referring to the fact that I have been guessing at what results my CSS will produce, or that a lot of my effort is currently trial and error.

I chose my words poorly.

That’s simply how web development is done these days, *specifically because that’s the best way we’ve discovered.* Keep in mind that css stands for “cascading style sheets”, which implies inheritance of styles from parent elements to child elements. The characteristics of the system you’re mentioning represent the fundamental concepts of css. 

Look into flexbox if you’re frustrated with all the different css styles for manipulating the position of a single element or multiple elements. It’s a bit more difficult to wrap your head around at first, but pays off in the long term.

The cascading inheritance definitely throws people for a loop if they don't have a solid understanding of how the various prominent elements affect layouts.

Just putting the items anywhere does not help.  You have to organize them by putting them in a drawer.

Its very common where you will have something like a &lt;div&gt; container that is supposed to be a row (as in 100% the width of the page), and then the children divs of that div are the 3 main content blocks of that page.  Some of those children may be complex and have their own set of divs inside them as well.",2.0
fxcwzms,hnbh45,"Divs are just boxes, just like other more semantic tags are boxes too with extra meaning baked in (such as main, nav, article, section etc.)

Boxes are necessary as sections of content needs to be grouped together in order to be styled or positioned, too many divs is usually a sign that you're using the wrong technique that requires extra wrappers, or you're going for a special effect that can't be achieved by a single box.

Basically when it comes to extra boxes/wrappers you need to know exactly why you're putting them in, if no good reason then they should go.

Grid is helpful if you need items to align vertically and also better if you need content to be positioned in a specific place. It is very efficient in terms of the number of boxes/tags you need because you can assign boxes to exact position on the grid template. It requires some setup so it makes complicated thing easy but easy things a bit more annoying.

Flex is much better at handling situations where you don't need items in the box to be positioned precisely and align with other boxes vertically, you worry more about proportions and how the space is divided up (being equal sized, auto-fill remaining space, stretch and shrink based on container size etc.). All in all it makes easy things trivial and complicated layout become messy to do so grid takes over from there.

Position property wise you shouldn't need that for layout anymore, maybe for niche scenarios where you need absolutely positioned element for special purposes (important message/announcement etc.)",2.0
fxlui1n,hnbh45,"Okay. First of all, *don't panic*.

Think about where you are. You, the person. The computer you're using to browse this site. The chair you're sitting on (or not). You can think of this as the site's *content*.

Now think of the room you're sitting in. That room is a box, isn't it? And you're sitting in the box? But it's not just that box, is it? There's another box called a *house* your room sits in. Come to think of it, everything in our lives is a box of some sort -- a room, a house, an office, an office building, a store, our car, and so on.

We use these boxes to structure and organize our lives.

This same philosophy is embedded in HTML and CSS. In more structured CSS courses, it's called the ""box model"", the idea that everything on a website is either a box or in a box.

In HTML, we use the &lt;div&gt; tag to specify a box.

Now, let's think about the relationship between your house and your room. Your room has certain features, right? But not all of them. You probably don't cook in your room. You certainly don't take a shower in it. You have other rooms used for these features, and spaces linking these rooms together. Each of these is its own box, and it is only through the combination of all of these *together* that you get your working house.

So, if you think of your website as your house, and yourself and your stuff as the content, then you could say we use HTML's &lt;div&gt; tag the way we use rooms and room-like structures (like hallways) to organize our stuff in our house. It's the same logic IKEA catalogs want us to buy into, really.

Finally, let me end on another note: once you familiarize yourself with this more architectural view of the world and how CSS implements web design as something akin to studio architecture (probably one of the reasons I like it so much!) then start learning how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox. These are models of how boxes interact that make CSS' boxes easier to use. Flexbox IMO is easier to master -- I used it almost exclusively in my earliest projects -- but Grid is much more powerful and I'm much more inclined to solving my layout problems with it instead these days.",2.0
fxpdd2k,hnbh45,"Thank you for this detailed break down and great analogy.  I couldn't agree more.  When I posted this, I didn't have a philosophy for understanding how to approach a layout with CSS.  

The analogies that have been provided really hit home, especially coupled with (at least for a beginner like me) the notion to view the overall plan as the method to approach the layout, rather than trying to solve layout from the standpoint of a specific item.  

When I draw out the actual layout for my page first, considering for even the white space, it became more clear how to structure the layout in CSS.  I end up getting to my desired results much quicker, and also reduce the styling problems to isolated bits.

You don't just build the framework for a house &lt;body&gt; and then put a bathroom &lt;div&gt; in somewhere and then try to place it with css.  Your house &lt;body&gt; has a layout &lt;div with some container class&gt;and a bunch of rooms &lt;div with more container classes&gt; which each in turn have a bunch of features &lt;div with some style class&gt; (or maybe even more containers).

When you draw out the layout you want to achieve, it's rather like how architects draw out the houses they're designing, isn't it? You've got such-and-such space you need to work with and you need to figure out how the space is going to be *used*. That includes the white space!

The updated modern layout systems, Flexbox and Grid, took the approach that you specify your layout on a container (which is also what table did) and then you can worry less about having to position each individual child. Just being a part of that flexbox or grid takes care of its layout.

That is why you see wrapper divs. Embrace them. It means that layout is really about each box's relationship to each other as siblings.

justify = main axis

align = cross axis,

**For grid**

justify = inline axis

align = block axis

Let's put it this way for now, assuming we're not changing the flex direction, align = vertical, justify = horizontal

`align-content` aligns the lines vertically when there is extra space to do so.

`align-items` is basically like writing `align-self` on every item, meaning that you move the items within a line.

`justify-content` is the same as `align-content`, but horizontally / for main axis / inline axis.

`justify-items` same as `align-items` but horizontally / for main axis / inline axis.

`justify-items` is **ignored in flexbox**, below is the explanation.

**Tab Atkins:**

&gt;*Because there can be multiple children in that axis.  The \*-self properties only work if the child is all alone in that axis.  When there are multiple boxes to be aligned, they can only be aligned en masse, with the \*-content properties.*

fwqkuun,hjxvtw,"tldr: This only shows up with some OS-level settings. Change `.container`'s width and grid-template-columns from `vw` to `%`.

---

If you're using a mac, you can change your System Preferences / General / Show Scrollbar setting between ""always"" and ""when scrolling"" to see this problem arise and resolve itself. The fundamental issue is that you're defining `.container` as 100% of the viewport's width, but the viewport includes old fashioned ""always"" scrollbars (but _not_ the overlaid ""when scrolling"" scrollbars).

A `div` is a block-level element and wants to be 100% of its parent element's width anyway, so you can solve the problem by just letting it do its thing. If you remove or replace the 100vw (and the 4 columns defined as 25vw each), it resolves itself.

Note that the vertical height of each `.item` is then a tiny bit off in some cases. 25% of the page's area is not exactly the same as 25vw in cases where there's an ""always"" scrollbar. That leads to rows that are a tiny bit taller than perfect squares.",1.0

fwow9tr,hjqb2y,"In short: Responsive CSS.

A bit longer: Banner is blue background. The text and the figure are in a container each on the same level. CSS rules along with media breakpoints determine whether elements on the same level are supposed to shown side by side or on multiple rows. The grid system they're using follows the 12-part and if you look at the CSS classes of the figure, you see the following:

    sa-small-12 sa-medium-6 sa-large-6

Which basically says that the figure will take up the whole width of the container when it's on a small screen and half when it's on a medium or large screen.

Basically what I think is happening is that in `:root`, `--box-shadow-line` is ultimately being compiled into `0 0 0 1px blue`. When you update the colour variable later, `--box-shadow-line` has already been set/compiled and is not going to account for a new colour in a new scope.

fwkflv3,hitt5g,"Yep, that makes sense. I wrote that assuming it was more of a pass by reference thing, and that setting `box-shadow: var(--box-shadow-line)` in `#foo` would recompile it. It stinks that it's won't recompile, but it definitely makes sense. And it's probably better for optimization overall anyway.",1.0
fwvw81o,hitt5g,"That won't work because you do not have a locally scoped variable called ""--box-shadow-line"" so it takes the Global one which is blue.

**Imagine it like this:**

    #foo {
    --box-shadow-color: green;
    color: var(--box-shadow-color);
    box-shadow: var(--box-shadow-line);
    }

`--box-shadow-line is not defined inside #foo, so it takes the value defined in the :root, even though you defined --box-shadow-color, you cannot replace it like that because it will only read as ""--box-shadow-line"" and not what's inside the global value of that variable.`

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, if you look at this:**

    #foo {
    --box-shadow-color: green;
    --box-shadow-line: 0 0 0 1px var(--box-shadow-color);
    color: var(--box-shadow-color);

    }

Effectively, `--box-shadow-line` seems to ""resolve"" at `:root` because that's where the property is used.

html:

But if you are trying to build a responsive design for mobile, then flex and percent will only get you so far. It'll be proportional to the screen for sure, but it will feel very cramped on a phone.

What you really want is to look into media queries. This will let you say stuff like, ""use this set of styles if the screen is greater than this width, this other set of styles if the screen is less than this other width, and this final set of styles if it's in between.""

Then you can conditionally show your hamburger menu when the screen is small, and just show the expanded menu items along the top when it's big and there is room for them all.",1.0

fw6w0dd,hgxti5,"By using percentage-based units to size your columns, you're not really taking full advantage of the power of flexbox.

You can simply flush your shopping cart icon to the right by setting your parent wrapper div to display: flex and justify-content: space-between. Next, set the last item that you want to be left-aligned (in your case, the ""Logo"" item) and set it to flex: 1; . This will automatically push your shopping cart to the right side.

Then to space your hamburger menu away from your logo, you can just use either padding or margin left or right and set the appropriate rem units for how much space you want.

Also, I'm not sure why exactly you needed a toggle element. Was this an accessibility concern for using a toggle element over just a regular div? If so, you can probably just set focus states for your icons (which you should anyways).

fwanvy3,hgt5fu,"Ok, I don't fully understand how the minmax() rule in grid-template-columns actually works. I haven't seen any examples or tutorials having the max value of anything other than ""1fr"".

However, I've listed below some changes to do what you want.

1. Set box-sizing model to include content + padding + borders
2. In grid-template-columns, change ""auto-fill"" to ""auto-fit"". Change ""360px"" to ""1fr"".
3. Optional: add another class rule for the grid-items - set their max-width to 300px.
4. Be aware of how the ""gap:30px"" rule in the .wrapper class works.

&amp;#8203;

    /* make box dimensions include borders and paddings. */
    * { 
    box-sizing: border-box; 
    } 
    ... 
    /* set grid and columns; 
      set the min-width for items, with unlimited widths ... (note additional class to limit widths) */
    .wrapper { 
    	display: grid ; 
    	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit,minmax(260px,1fr)) ; 
    } 
    /* limit the max-widths of the grid items */ 
    .wrapper &gt; div { 
    	max-width: 300px; 
    }

Note that auto-fill and auto-fit behave slightly differently.

Here's a couple of pages that talks about auto-fill and auto-fit:

Let's say you set the overlay's class as .overlay. You can set .overlay { opacity: 0; } and .overlay:hover { opacity: 100; } to make the buttons appear when you hover over it. As for the stretching you can probably achieve it by playing around with the transforms",2.0
fw6p8qr,hgrypc,"Yep, this is all done in css. Using that URL you had provided, you can poke around using the chrome developer tools on the divs and force the hover state using the :hov button: [https://prnt.sc/t7kdqc](https://prnt.sc/t7kdqc)

The parent ""bike-card bike-card--default"" div is what everything's connected to for the hover states, so forcing hover on that div will constantly expose what the whole div looks like when the user hovers over it.

Using this as a reference, I've noticed a couple of transitions.

The parent div that wraps the whole card adds a transform: translateY(-22px); and is also set to position: relative (important to set this because some of the children are set to absolute. This way it uses the parent element as a reference for top, left and right rather than the entire page) The transition is set to all properties in your link, but you'll want to use ""transition: 0.25s ease-in-out"" then use ""transition-property: transform"" that way it'll make it a little more lightweight.

Theres a child div container, ""bike-card\_\_actions"" that's originally set to position: absolute; bottom: 0; and height: 0; When the parent card is hovered, the height of this div is set to 45px, and the bottom (absolute position property) is set to -45px (same as the new height of the div. Same as with the parent div, ""transition: 0.25s ease-in-out"", but instead use ""transition-property: height, bottom""

The button elements themselves are pretty standard, they're just using display: flex; and sizing the buttons exact at 50% of the card width with by using ""flex-basis: 50%;""",2.0

* How does this game works?
* How does this game does event handling?",3.0
fw6tuj6,hgq40x,"The main part of the game works like this:

Each crab has it's dedicated checkbox input element that is followed by the HTML element that displays the crab. Both elements overlap, but the invisible input element is on top of the crab. If you press the input element the input becomes checked and a CSS selector will hide it. Another CSS selector will hide the crab that is the adjacent sibling element of the input box.

The most relevant part of the CSS looks like this:

`input.target:checked + .crab {`  
  `display: block;`  
`}`  
[`input.target`](https://input.target)`:checked {`  
  `display: block;`  
`}`

The first selector hides the crab, the second one the input element itself. You can also look it up live using your browsers dev tools (I recommend Firefox) or look at the file CSS/main.css starting from line 123.

The winning condition works quite similar but uses \\\~ (the general sibling combinator) as selector to figure out whether a unchecked checkbox exist and if it doesn't it shows the win screen.

[`input.target`](https://input.target)`:checked ~ #win {`  
  `display: none;`  
`}`

You can find more in CSS/win.css

g8ox7to,jaco3b,"No need to apologize.

Let's take a look at the first link you've provided, because it's the simplest one, it doesn't need you to change your HTML markup.

So how does it work ? 

  
**CSS**

    /* Flashlight Overlay */
    :root {
      cursor: none; /* Hide your cursor */
      --cursorX: 50vw; /* Declares a custom property representing the cursor position on the X axis */
      --cursorY: 50vh; /* Declares a custom property representing the cursor position on the Y axis */
    }
    :root:before { 
      /* Create a pseudo element on the root of the document.
      This pseudo element is the dark overlay on top of your page.
      We need to make sure that it will take the whole page
    */
      content: '';
      display: block;
      width: 100%; /* Make sure the overlay is 100% wide */
      height: 100%; /* Make sure the overlay is 100% tall */
      position: fixed; /* Make sure the overlay won't move when you scroll */
      pointer-events: none; /* You will be able to interact with the content under the overlay */
      background: radial-gradient(
        circle 10vmax at var(--cursorX) var(--cursorY),
        rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%,
        rgba(0,0,0,.5) 80%,
        rgba(0,0,0,.95) 100%
      ) /* Declares a circular gradial-radient going from transparent to black with an opacity of 0.95
      The center of the gradient is defined using the custom property we did defined before.
      Why using the custom properties ? Because you'll change them using javascript!
    */
    }

**Javascript**

    function update(e){
      var x = e.clientX || e.touches[0].clientX // get the position of the cursor on the X axis
      var y = e.clientY || e.touches[0].clientY // get the position of the cursor on the Y axis
    
      document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--cursorX', x + 'px') // update the custom property defined in the css
      document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--cursorY', y + 'px') // update the custom property defined in the css
    }
    
    document.addEventListener('mousemove',update) // Run the function when you move your cursor
    document.addEventListener('touchmove',update)

As you can see, you need both the css and the javascript to make it work.

The css is used to create an overlay with a radial gradient.    
The javascript is used to update the center of the radial gradient.",1.0

More importantly, and sadly not taught in popular CSS tutorials, you want to practice thinking like components. *Is the behavior of this element dependent on or determined by its ancestor?* If yes, then they are parts of the same component.

That being said, if I wasn't already using Font Awesome for a project, I wouldn't use social sharing buttons that required it.

g8a8kx8,j8be0i,Flex and Grid are not exclusive. They are complementary to each other. I don't see any reason not to use them.,5.0
g8agexj,j8be0i,"The rule of thumb is to use CSS Grid for two dimensional layout (i.e. horizontal AND vertical layout blocks) and use Flexbox for one dimensional layout (horizontal OR vertical) that wrap or unwrap when the size changes. 

A lot of it is trial and error. I recently started a page with CSS Grid then simplified the layout so much that CSS Grid was unnecessarily complicated so I changed over to Flexbox. Of course if you just want to align a content box horizontally, just use margin: X auto.",4.0
g8ak46x,j8be0i,"Good to know! Just one question, though. For example, let's say I was making something like an app drawer, where you have rows and rows of similarly-sized elements. Would CSS Grid be better because it's two dimensions? Or would you use Flexbox because it's horizontal layout that wraps into lots of rows? I haven't done much with CSS Grid, so I've always defaulted to Flexbox for pages involving lots of rows of elements.",1.0
g8at0ui,j8be0i,"I'd stick to flexbox. What you're after is only rows with one or more divs in each row that may wrap when required and that's exactly what flexbox is perfect for. 

Just because the divs inside each flexbox row may wrap and appear to be two dimensional, it's really just one row that has fattened out to accommodate the wrapped divs. 

CSS Grid is awesome but it's can be a little more complicated to set up and maintain and it's just not worth it for something as simple as what you want.",2.0

g8catwg,j8be0i,"I know that feeling!

Flexbox (among other concepts in programming) seems like magic,  compared to when I first started playing with web design. In Microsoft FrontPage it was good practice to make layouts with iframes and tables.

It feels like flexbox is almost too good to be true, and it feels like you should only use it when absolutely necessary. That is not the case though!

Use flexbox for everything, if it makes sense!",1.0

g8awapp,j8aocu,"`&lt;div class=""button""&gt;`? Really? Damn, if only there was a better, more semantic element for that, haha.

Don't forget, folks, that CSS is part of a trinity; don't neglect your HTML otherwise you'll end up actively harming your user's experience with markup like the above 🤦",7.0
g8axr7u,j8aocu,This. Tutorials should have atleast basics done corectly.,3.0
g8ay99c,j8aocu,Could you explain that further? I'm just starting with CSS/HTML and I'm not exactly sure what you mean (so maybe it's my beginner's confusion here...),2.0
g8b5iy7,j8aocu,"Sure thing - so the 'trinity' that I'm talking about here is HTML / CSS / JS - and they all go hand-in-hand.  The role of HTML is to describe its contents as accurately as possible, the role of CSS is to define all the different style-states that are possible, and the role of JS is to extend the HTML and CSS beyond their limitations by manipulating them and adding additional functionality.

The primary beef I raised here is [semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) \- in HTML, `&lt;div&gt;` and `&lt;span&gt;` don't mean anything - their purpose is just to provide something to attach a css class to; if you want to say that a HTML element is clickable and it will change something on the page, then you should use a `&lt;button&gt;`; if you want to say it's clickable and it will link somewhere then you should use an `&lt;a&gt;`.

It doesn't matter if these HTML elements don't look how you want them to; because that's where CSS comes in and allows you to style them however you like.  If you don't use accurate markup then:

* **Screen-readers don't understand what the content is** \- hurting users of assistive technologies (which, for context, usually outnumber Safari users, so not an insignificant number)
* **Crawlers don't userstand what the content is** \- hurting your SEO and also shortening the lifespan of your site; how can a smartphone render 'simplified view' or a smartwatch figure out what content to include and what to omit if it doesn't understand what the content is?
* **It makes the code harder to maintain** \- if everything is a `&lt;div&gt;` then all you have to go on in the codebase is the class names, and that can become a headache fast.  If you have code that can explain its purpose at a glance, then everything becomes a lot easier.  This can be enhanced further by plugging any gaps in the HTML spec using [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets).

This is, unfortunately, a bit of a common problem in webdev, which is why I make an effort to call it out when I see it; people don't all have the same experience as you do!

Some users view sites at fullscreen, some snap to half their window, some mac users like to have lots of strangely-sized windows - make sure your code can accomodate them!

Some users view sites at 200% zoom to make the text more readable, some users rely on screen-readers and chrome extensions to navigate the site through audio cues instead of visual ones, some users rely only on [keyboard shortcuts to navigate between  headings and landmarks](https://youtu.be/vAAzdi1xuUY) on the page - make sure your code can accomodate them too!

Hope that helps clarify - if you'd like to read more about accessibility then [the a11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) has a useful checklist and further-reading on the topic.",6.0
