g8p8mrb,jadqxl,Thanks. Do you know of any textbooks for the SA Professional certification? Looks like O'Reilly just has Associate.,1.0
g8pa3jc,jadqxl,You don't have to read the documentation cover-to-cover. You can just review the topics that are covered in the exam guide. The whitepapers serve as useful supplemental material. You should also get an AWS account for testing and playing around with the services covered by the exam.,1.0
g8pbp7o,jadqxl,"Have you actually looked at a good video instruction for aws? Like Maerek's course.

I think the alternative is white papers and documentation on aws website. But the issue you'll run into is the amount of text you will need to go through. Each whitepaper is at least 100 pages and sometimes few hundred pages. Its not the most efficient way and its time consuming. 
I felt doing a good training video was much better use of time. I did cloud academy and Maerek's and they both were really good at making the point across in just 15-30 minutes and goes into lot of depth. 

I think there is a shortage of high quality, condensed text material that is in depth and technical. Something that we can look at and read and understand the concept. Instead the whitepapers are very wordy, not a quick read at all. 

Just look at Well Architected white paper, if you have problems falling asleep, it cant be beat.",1.0
g8pdc2a,jadqxl,"Thanks, yeah I have started a few video courses to get an idea. The problem is that I have been using AWS for years, and so I have very deep understanding of some topics, but very patchy coverage of others. It's hard to anticipate whether or not I know the content of a video without watching it. I get frustrated when I watch a 30min video and  it turns out that I already knew 90% of it. I end up watching on 2x speed but then the risk is that I'll miss the valuable 10%. 

Text content avoids that for me, because I can skim over the parts I already know. If there's a lack of high quality content of that type, then so be it - I'll stick to videos! But I thought it was worth asking first :)",1.0

g8o938m,ja8mua,"It's an I3.large instance - it already has instance store (0.475 TB NVMe SSD)

The question talks about it being a temporary database (meaning nothing with persistence requirements) so instance store is safe to use.

It would be more clicks to do the EBS volumes, since you have to create it &amp; attach it, and provide a more expensive solution given the requirements (the instance store is included in the price)

The other consideration is IO1's 50:1 max IOPS/SIZE ratio, meaning a 50GB volume (as indicated in the answer) offers a max of 2500 IOPS, the question requires 3000

Assuming the answer marked as correct is the one in green, i agree.

For what it's worth (given I'm talking about a competitor here) I don't see any vagueness or ambiguity here, it's a pretty solid question.

What I will say from my perspective, I recommend to my students to skip CCP ... I personally don't see its value and I've designed my SAA course to not require it... even 100% newcomers to IT/AWS/Cloud have done really well on SAA (some even have jobs now) without doing CCP.

One comment I see , is that CCP + 50% off voucher + SAA is not much more expensive than just SAA on its own ... which is true. And it's good practice .. which I can see the logic in. For me though, I don't buy into that, since time is the only limited resource we have and I always stay on the side of efficiency.

g8p1too,ja899d,"If you have any AWS experience, then I would suggest you skip the CCP.

I got my CCP about this time last year. And at that time, I had zero experience with AWS. My company was dipping its toes into it and I wanted to get a better understanding of what AWS offers and what it all can do.

The studying was great, and I felt I learned a lot at what they offered. One annoying thing was there were multiple questions that would quiz you on your knowledge of their support tiers (this one, you get a response in an hour vs 24 hours, etc.). But I suppose it has merit.

I'm currently studying for the SAA, and that's after I've had some experience with AWS.

I took a one-day class for CCP and I felt like a fish out of water, but that's because it's my first entry into AWS.

When I took the three-day course for SAA, I understood everything the instructor was going over and then truly appreciated the in-depth discussions on the numerous topics. 

To mirror what others have said, if you want a good high-level knowledge of what AWS offers, the CCP is the right choice. If you intend to take the SAA, you may want to hold off from the CCP and pursue the SAA. However, if you have no experience working with AWS, then pursuing the SAA will be more difficult. Not impossible, but it is far more in-depth than the CCP.",1.0

You have two types of instances ... one which is twice the size, but previous gen (so objectively not twice the performance, but thats just tiny detail).

The load on the instances assuming default configurations will be mismatched.

The correct answer being to change the situation to bring parity .. either replace the smaller with bigger, or bigger with smaller (and more of them).

Without being able to see answer D, A seems best.

Re. C ... there is no 'weighted routing policy' in ELB, its target group weight.

Also that's an ALB thing, not a CLB thing.

Since the question says ELB .. which in this context can mean CLB or ALB.. you don't know you have the ALB functionality needed for this, so it excludes itself.

Never assume ELB = ALB... ELB = Family, CLB = Classic, NLB = Network, ALB = Application. There are many features supported on the v2's so NLB and ALB which aren't supported on CLB (so not on the vaguer ELB term)",2.0
g8mp4bc,j9zivi,"You don't know the amount of request comming to the ELB.

g8krhio,j9n438,"hey /u/Jersey86Devil

So I'm going to start this with a disclosure, i create courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io/) but I want to make my suggestions below neutral.

The first step, is to reframe this a little - don't think about this as 'getting certifications' think about it as learning the AWS products, services, architectures and implementation details and passing the certification as a result.

It's possible to break into the industry with no skills and experience, I have a growing list of students who've shifted careers from non IT into working in AWS - it just takes time and effort.  I've helped librarians change career, firefighters, lawyers, hospitality staff - anyone can do it.

The first step is picking a path.

**Certifications**

The first step is to understand the certifications, abstract away from any particular course for a second. AWS offers a few different types and levels of certifications

Overall, the certs are split between ROLE based certs and SPECIALITY based certs. Forget the specialities for a second, they come later.

In the ROLE based certs, you have a few levels.

Practitioner

Associate

Professional

I'm not a fan of the practitioner certification, It's not really known/regarded by employers and IMO its not efficient to study in isolation since there is a massive overlap with the Associate level. So regardless of existing skill level, i would skip past this.

In my opinion, 99% of people should start at the associate level, and there are 3 streams here, architect, developer and sysops administrator.

Almost everyone should start with Solutions Architect Associate - it's foundational, it covers the architecture and integration methods of all of the core AWS services so IMO it makes an ideal starting point.

From that point, you have choices ... you can either cover the other associates then move to the professional level, or move straight to Solutions Architect Professional.. (thats a big decision)

I wouldn't suggest moving to the speciality certs (which cover areas you are specifically interested in) until you have the SA Associate and SA Pro.

**Courses And Content**

Courses are either focussed on passing the exam or focussed on teaching real skills &amp; passing the exam. The former are generally shorter and cheaper, they get you the exam, but have questionable long term value. The latter are longer, more expensive, get you the cert but also teach real skills. Courses have a variable amount of practical content - this is harder to produce so many of the cheaper courses have less.

If you want to gain real skills and get a job working with AWS, specifically if you have no experience then you should focus on real skills focussed courses.

Courses are either subscription or one time enrollment (and keep in mind for the latter, some impose a 1 year limited access on it).

(starting to talk about my stuff here - warning!!)

I suggest the following

1. Start studying for SA Associate.. IMO its the best place to start
2. Join a community i suggest [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com/) \- you will learn and improve by just being around other people doing the same thing.
3. Use real AWS accounts not restricted sandboxes
4. Demos Demos Demos - these teach practical skills i maintain a free demos repo [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs)
5. If you do the SA Associate here are some notes which might help

Great resource too on the slack channel,3.0
g8le0qe,j9n438,"It is doable but you have to really want it. Learning AWS and passing the certification tests is hard enough, but without experience it is hard to find a job. I have no IT experience but I started learning AWS about 6 months ago and passed a bunch of certifications, including the SA-pro. I am now trying to find a job working with AWS and I am finding it very difficult. Recruiters are constantly emailing me with available positions, but when I respond and see I have no prior experience my certs mean nothing. I have had some luck, I am going for my 3rd interview at a company today but it is only after I have applied for every IT/cloud position I see posted. 

This can be done. Just know that without experience, getting certified will only be half the battle. If this is an idea you have that you think sounds cool and you just want to devote a little free time here and there, you may not succeed. If you want it more than anything else in the world and you are willing to really put in the work, you can make it happen. 

There are a ton of people in this sub that will give discouraging words and tell you that it either can't be done, or that you need to start as a janitor at a tech company and work your way up. Don't listen to them. If you are willing to sacrifice and work hard, then you can do this. Just don't let yourself think it will be easy.

When we are new to IT, we find ourselves in a catch 22, we want a chance to gain experience but companies want us to already have that experience. I would definitely recommend choosing a training course that covers the fundamentals. Having that fundamentals understanding will be crucial. And then of course start building. Hands on labs are great to get that real world hands on experience but you can also build in your own AWS account. Participate in communities like you are doing here; I learn daily from others in our slack channel. And keep applying to jobs that interest you. We have learning paths that may help too, so you can see what courses will help you end up where you want to be. And reach out, we are all here to help!",1.0
g8mwxf7,j9n438,"This is Andrew Brown. AWS Community Hero.

On average it takes 3 years to break into any of the three industries (Web, Mobile, Cloud). For web, if you just stick it out another year, I think you would haven broken in.

The number of people applying can be discouraging, but it doesn't really matter, since there are so many low quality candidates,  90% are filtered out so you're really competing with a smaller pool.

You don't need past-work experience at a company. You need to prove that you can do the work. The best way is to pour your energy into a single project and treat it like a real product or service. I see lots of project portfolios but they toy apps, so you have no sense that the person can handle real workloads.

The challenge with a career in cloud is that roles are not well defined. Cloud Engineer, Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineers are loosely defined so its hard to understand the expectations of the role without deep investigating into the company you are applying to.

Junior cloud roles for pure cloud roles are far and few. Mostly people are getting into cloud roles because they are transitioning from a previous roles like Web-application development and then adding cloud skills.

If you're getting AWS Certified with no past experience then you may as well get the most in-expensive AWS Certification such as the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) commonly known as the CCP.  

There are two kinds of employers for cloud:  

1. Companies that have a strong focus on cloud, they are generally part of the Amazon Partner Network (APN)  eg. DataDog, SignalFX
2. Companies that use cloud because they have to host this applications somewhere, but their knowledge of AWS Certification is limited

The first is going to be too hard for you to break into, you're going to be going after the second. To them the CCP looks as good as an associate. So if you just want to fulfill that certification checkbox just get the CCP.

In the #100DaysOfCloud discord which I think now have over 1000 members. The goal of our community is connect you with other people trying to break into the industry,

[https://discord.gg/dW2XRcF](https://discord.gg/dW2XRcF)",0.0
g8oe0d8,j9n438,"I have to disagree with the advice here. Even companies who use cloud need someone who knows their way around AWS that can can solve real problems. With the CCP, you might know what a service is for and not much else. There's Google for that. Nobody will hire you with just a CCP. CCP can't be compared to the SA Associate, they are miles apart. 

But, even with SAA, you will need to understand other technologies and you should have a portfolio of projects using various technologies together that shows an understanding of how to piece things together to solve a problem. Look at job postings and find out what other technologies companies are looking for. With the CCP, you won't even make it past a recruiter or interview, if you get that far. Remember, the point is not to get a job, but to do the work as part of the job. If you just get a CCP and stop there, you're wasting your time. You will not be in a position to be an asset to a company with that. They would rather bring in an intern at no cost.

Start a blog and talk about what you're working on, get on Twitter and link to your posts, engage in dialog, network, put yourself in front of people and show you have some knowledge. Message people in roles or companies where you want to be. People are willing to mentor or at least be a contact. Not everyone will bother to help you, but that's ok. Keep reaching out till you make some head way. Maybe, someone will recognise your effort and knowledge, or you can just ask your network to help you put a word in. It's doable, but it will take time. Also, look local, don't start looking to work for a mid to large company. See if you can contribute to a local company. Join your local meetup group, that's a great way to network with employees of local companies. If you're looking for a devops role, get involved in an open source project and build your GitHub profile.

Without experience, you're going to need a good network to help vouch for you and a good portfolio of projects. Companies give their employees opportunities to look for new candidates, so make use of that. People who know how hard you're working to get a chance will put a word in for you. The tech industry hires people from all kinds of backgrounds, so it's really about putting in the work to make yourself be noticed.

My advice, skip the CCP, your time is better spent on SAA and above.",1.0

g8du3dy,j8t60p,"Hi /u/Wormy21

So I'm going to start this with a disclosure, i create courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) but I want to make my suggestions below neutral.

**Certifications**

The first step is to understand the certifications, abstract away from any particular course for a second. AWS offers a few different types and levels of certifications

Overall, the certs are split between ROLE based certs and SPECIALITY based certs. Forget the specialities for a second, they come later.

In the ROLE based certs, you have a few levels.

Practitioner

Associate

Professional

I'm not a fan of the practitioner certification, It's not really known/regarded by employers and IMO its not efficient to study in isolation since there is a massive overlap with the Associate level. So regardless of existing skill level, i would skip past this.

In my opinion, 99% of people should start at the associate level, and there are 3 streams here, architect, developer and sysops administrator.

Almost everyone should start with Solutions Architect Associate - it's foundational, it covers the architecture and integration methods of all of the core AWS services so IMO it makes an ideal starting point. 

From that point, you have choices ... you can either cover the other associates then move to the professional level, or move straight to Solutions Architect Professional.. (thats a big decision)

I wouldn't suggest moving to the speciality certs (which cover areas you are specifically interested in) until you have the SA Associate and SA Pro.

**Courses And Content**

As you have found out the space is full of lots of courses, some long, some short, some expensive some cheap, some on udemy, some on the vendors own sites. Without talking specifically about my content there are a few things to keep in mind

Courses are either focussed on passing the exam or focussed on teaching real skills &amp; passing the exam. The former are generally shorter and cheaper, they get you the exam, but have questionable long term value. The latter are longer, more expensive, get you the cert but also teach real skills.

Courses have a variable amount of practical content - this is harder to produce so many of the cheaper courses have less.

Courses are either subscription or one time enrollment (and keep in mind for the latter, some impose a 1 year limited access on it).

(starting to talk about my stuff here - warning!!)

I suggest the following

1. Start studying for SA Associate.. IMO its the best place to start
2. Join a community i suggest [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com)
3. Use real AWS accounts not restricted sandboxes
4. Demos Demos Demos - these teach practical skills i maintain a free demos repo [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs)
5. If you do the SA Associate here are some notes which might help

/u/acantril has already given you some solid advice. So in a nutshell start exploring the solutions architect associate. This is the basis/foundation for everything else. After doing this you will get a very good understanding and appreciation for the rest. From there you can then make a decision on advanced/specialty streams.


I bought the popular courses on udemy and /u/acantril's courses. They serve different purposes.

g8e0r4p,j8t60p,"Hi /u/Wormy21

I feel slightly different from /u/acantril in that I think AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) is a great place to start if you just truly have no idea wtf is going on in AWS and you're not sure if you want to pursue this knowledge more seriously. One thing I've seen a lot of people in IT do is shell out a lot of money for courses and bootcamps only to realize a few weeks/months into it that they have no interest in pursuing it further. In this regard, A Cloud Guru's CCP course is a great way to just get your feet wet without making a huge commitment. The course is only 7 hours long and covers just the high level concepts. In the worst-case scenario you've spent 1 month on ACG subscription and wasted only 7 hours of your time to learn that it's not for you. If you decide to sit for the CCP test (which I highly recommend) you also get a feel for what the standardized testing experience is like if you haven't done something like it in a long time.

Keep in mind that like /u/acantril advised, CCP won't really help you on your resume or in your job prospects but if you finish the 7 hour course and you're like ""hell yeah I want to know more about all of this"" then waste no time and cancel your A Cloud Guru membership and RUN (don't walk) over to [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) and sign up for the Solutions Architect - Associate course.

g8dfe2r,j8s6dm,"/u/vanillacap yeah so warm standby would be running reduced size versions of things

Pilot light would be running core infrastructure, replicating data in, and then switching stuff on as needed.

&gt;**Pilot light.** The idea of the pilot light is an analogy that comes from gas heating. In that scenario, a small flame that‚Äôs always on can quickly ignite the entire furnace to heat up a house. In this DR approach, you simply replicate part of your IT structure for a limited set of core services so that the AWS cloud environment seamlessly takes over in the event of a disaster. A small part of your infrastructure is always running simultaneously syncing mutable data (as databases or documents), while other parts of your infrastructure are switched off and used only during testing. Unlike a backup and recovery approach, you must ensure that your most critical core elements are already configured and running in AWS (the pilot light). When the time comes for recovery, you can rapidly provision a full-scale production environment around the critical core.

The wording is a little vague though which means there is a chance it could be warm standby.

&gt;The term warm standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud. A warm standby solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation. It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running. By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on.

But Pilot light makes more sense as the correct answer. With pilot light you would have your DB's replicated in, maybe your domain controllers replicating in. Other services would be migrated in, but shutdown ready to be powered on.

The problem with the question is I dont think it provides any 'clear' keywords which can push the recommended answer from Pilot Light towards Warm Standby i.e.

&gt;in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud.

g89rgyu,j874hm,"If you don't already have IT experience, it will be difficult to land a Cloud role as your very first position. An MS looks good on your resume and will probably get you some interviews, but in the end, hiring managers for Cloud-related roles generally want candidates with a broad IT background. 

This is because the Cloud is less of a thing on its own, and more of a combination of multiple technologies that have been developing over the decades. So if you don't understand and have experience with the technologies that underly the Cloud, you will be at a severe disadvantage to those who do.

You could always start with a generalist position, build your experience, and then look at specializing later on.

I am not ready to look for work until I build out a robust portfolio (outside of demo's and labs). However, I am feeling much more confident setting out to complete the portfolio stage after preparing for multiple AWS certs.

The goal posts have moved for me and I am now setting out to complete all 12 certs before the end of the year. (I have 4 more to go--Advanced Networking, Alexa and both pro level certs). I just had to dive deeper into Databases, Security and Networking after completing the associate trifecta. And with Alexa Skills... why the hell not at this point right! I'm committing to the cloud.

which use DNS vs prefix lists

what gateways do what

what gateways are AZ and region resilient.

g7yj977,j6ermb,"In almost all cases, Amazon SQS long polling is preferable to short polling. Long-polling requests let your queue consumers receive messages as soon as they arrive in your queue while reducing the number of empty ReceiveMessageResponse instances returned.

Amazon SQS long polling results in higher performance at reduced cost in the majority of use cases. However, if your application expects an immediate response from a ReceiveMessage call, you might not be able to take advantage of long polling without some modifications to your application.

For example, if your application uses a single thread to poll multiple queues, switching from short polling to long polling will probably not work, because the single thread will wait for the long-poll timeout on any empty queues, delaying the processing of any queues that might contain messages.

In such an application, it is a good practice to use a single thread to process only one queue, allowing the application to take advantage of the benefits that Amazon SQS long polling provides.

g7z7czp,j6ermb,"Long polling and short polling are concepts not specific to SQS. Think of long polling as a subscription that can wait until there's a message, and short polling as a simple ""Get message"" request that returns immediately.",3.0
g7zb9bi,j6ermb,"Thanks a lot, but on the doc is written : ‚ÄúThus, a particular ReceiveMessage request might not return all of your messages.‚Äù Why though?",1.0
g7zzosz,j6ermb,Hot take. This is because while SQS long polling hits all possible SQS servers short polling only selects a random subset of those servers per poll. I assume they designed it this way to limit the number of requests on servers. You'll still get the messages missing because you'll be polling again soon after. This happens so fast you likely won't notice it as an issue. As others have stated though the direct answer is you do want to be using long polling where possible. Also if your message queue isn't that big you may not miss messages with short polling at all as obviously you're using less servers.,2.0

g7z1u4u,j6ermb,I don't know if it is an option for your use case but you could set a lambda function to be triggered by the SQS when something is in the queue. That lambda function could either do the work itself or call some web service to do the actual work. This would bypass polling long or short if it is acceptable in your application.,1.0

Basis your skills you may take a specialty exam at any point of time, however I recommend  to take foundation level first to gain an overall view of AWS services.

Thank you for the answer.",3.0
g7vt5xh,j61za6,"To add more detail to this because people are arguing over interpretation.

The question asks for the situation where

1. The company must manage the encryption keys themselves
2. use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption.

There are 4 types of encryption

1. Client Side - you encrypt the object, and then upload to S3. You handle keys, and you handle encryption process. S3 is not involved in any way, it simply stores encrypted data. This is NOT correct for this question because YOU encrypt and NOT S3.
2. SSE-C - you manage keys, provide key and object to S3 and it encrypts for you (SSE-C is server side encryption, client managed keys) this is what answer D is, the correct answer
3. SSE-S3 - S3 manages keys and encryption.. you supply object, its encrypted. This is NOT correct, because S3 handles keys NOT you.
4. SSE-KMS as above, but with extra features. This is NOT correct, because S3 handles keys NOT you.

The correct answer is D... no doubt what so ever

D = SSE-C which is correct.

A Cannot be correct because bucket default encryption only works with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS (S3 manages keys, and does encryption). 

SSE-C (server side encryption with client managed keys ) and Client Side Encryption are NOT supported with bucket default encryption.

B is wrong ... because asymmetric key

C is wrong ... because asymmetric key

Correct Answer is D",1.0

Client side encryption is where you handle the encryption and decryption process, either directly or using SDK AND You manage the keys. Here you encrypt before sending.

SSE-C is where S3 as a service handles encryption and decryption, but where you provide and manage the keys. Here you provide the object and the key, and S3 encrypts it for you.

====

Client Side ... you manage keys, you encrypt and decrypt and then send to S3 encrypted.

SSE-C .. you manage keys, give the object and the key to S3 and it handles the encryption process.

SSE-S3 you provide the object... S3 handles encryption and the keys

SSE-KMS as above, but where you can customise the CMK used and use role separation.

g7spe54,j5l2vq,"I took it earlier this year and can confirm it was harder than the SAA for sure. Mainly because there's a LOT of material covered. 

You're using the same resources I used but one suggestion just in case: I really got a lot of use out of Bonso's tutorialsdojo website ([https://tutorialsdojo.com](https://tutorialsdojo.com)), which I much preferred over taking his tests on Udemy. On the website you can take 30 question practice tests with random questions, or take a test in flashcard mode where you see each answer as you go. I liked that A LOT better than taking 65 question tests on udemy and reviewing everything afterwards. 

Another suggestion - do as much practice in your AWS account as possible. If you're a super-duper memorizer, this might not matter as much. For me, doing something myself helped me retain the information 100 times better than just reading about it. 

Also - youtube can be a good resource for specific topics you want to learn more about. Also, look up the AWS Certification Quiz Show - I watched all of those while working in the garage for some background learning. The host asks questions, and the expert not only answers the question but also explains why each possible answer is right or wrong. Very helpful to me as well. 

Good luck!",4.0

Stephanes course for SysOps is pretty solid but it does have some overlap from his other courses.

g7x6zu2,j5cuic,"In my experience with two of the 900-level ""Fundamentals"" courses (Data and AI), if you went through the full learning path -- including links to additional documentation -- there was enough there to pass the exams, particularly if you are not starting 100% from scratch with the topic. However, for the Associate Level and above, the learning path provided a good outline, but to pass the exam there was a lot of extra reading and practice. Plus, there's an assumption that you've done work on that area as part of your professional job, which can be hard to distill down into a study plan. In that case, I found purchasing a practice exam essential. Even then, it was a bit frustrating because I didn't feel ""guided,"" once I left the Microsoft learning path.

g7j3agq,j4ibdk,"As someone with 25 years in IT, I can tell you definitively that certs are valuable in some cases and a waste of time in others.   

If you don‚Äôt have relevant experience, a cert doesn‚Äôt make up the difference.  As a hiring manager, I don‚Äôt really care if you just got 3 certs to go along with your CS degree.   It might make you slightly more valuable for an entry level position but it will still be an entry level position.  On the flip side, if you‚Äôve been working for me for a couple of years, I don‚Äôt care much about certs, either.  They give me a little information about your motivation level but I‚Äôm much more focused on what you actually produce.  

Where certs do matter is a couple of specific cases.  First, if you are going to do contract work, loading up on certs is valuable.   You still need the work experience to go along with it but there is a significant preference for certified contract / temp employees.  It‚Äôs an added stamp of approval - I know what I‚Äôm getting - when someone is coming in to do a short term project.  

The other case for certs is when you are changing jobs.   If you have the experience and the certs, you have a leg up on the person who just has the experience.   Worth the time and effort if you are considering moving to a new company.  

I think the pushback you see on this sub is against the ‚ÄúIve done a year on the help desk and I‚Äôm going to get certs so I can jump to DevOps‚Äù.  It just doesn‚Äôt work that way.   Even worse is the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm graduating with a CS degree and want to get a systems engineer job.  What certs should I get?‚Äù  Once again, it doesn‚Äôt work that way.  

One final use case for certs.   They can be a tool for keeping fresh on technology.  I work as a senior leader in IT at this point but I‚Äôm working on the SAA cert on the side.  Doesn‚Äôt do anything for me for my job or career and I‚Äôm not going to be architecting solutions but working on the certs helps keep me current and also gives me a basis for challenging the architects and engineers who work for me when they bring forward a plan.  I get a couple of certs per year just to stay current given that a lot of my job is budgets and other bullshit.  

Tl;dr.  Certs have value in certain cases but certs without experience don‚Äôt get you a lot despite the hopes of a lot of people on this sub.",70.0

g7j5xob,j4ibdk,"Completely agree - I‚Äôm also at a senior level and enjoyed doing SAA and DEV, the two of them have given me a good basic grounding in what AWS is, but the certs alone are no substitute for experience. 

When I‚Äôm interviewing people, it‚Äôs trivially easy to tell the people who have crammed for a cert from people who have real hands-on experience and knowledge. So the cert might push you a bit higher up the applicant pile and help get the first interview, but unless you‚Äôre very lucky it‚Äôs the experience that gets you the job.

How do you get the experience? separate topic, but the TL;DR version, use what you learned in that cert and build things. Build lots of things.

g7k0prl,j4ibdk,"100% agree this is my story too. 

Long version for people who don't believe this is how it works:

I have a 1st class Degree in Computing, majoring in Sys Admin. 

Whilst studying had a part time job in a video game shop.

After graduating I started on minimum wage doing a call center job for online banking. Literally telling people how to click login and press ""forgot my password"" for 40hours a week. No tech needed for this job just the usual ""customer service skills"" stuff and everyone is disposable and you read from a script most of the time. Hated it, but on my C.V I was ""providing technical support for users how to use online banking software and apps"" and I made it sound goooood on linkedin. 

After 6 months I landed an interview for helpdesk for a small firm that sold software to estate agents. Also minimum wage, but much more technical, I moved up to 1st line support there in under a year because I was bright enough to spot reoccurring issues for what they were and forward the bugs to the developers in more technical language than other people. I had a curious mind, even opening bits of the software code up in an IDE on the side and learning all I could. 

A year there and someone from the old video game job contacts me on linked in, he works for an ISP and has a gap on helpdesk, sees that's what I'm doing these days and invites me for interview.  Get that job and stay like 2-3 years , get exposure to servers, get to start to use my degree skills and learn more. Agree to take all the nightshifts no one else will, often on my own, survive numerous learn it or drown situations, make it to 2nd line server support, and start hanging around the 3rd line linux team asking what they are up to, can I help, teach me stuff please.

Move to a much bigger company, they use vmware so get all that exposure make it to 3rd line linux support, stay 4 years. Took a gap year to travel, come home, send my cv to recruiters and within a week am back as as a linux senior engineer.

I think certificates are useful on top of experience, or in specific situations. 

If you have already worked in I.T for a few years and want to side step or get a promotion, or move into a similar company using different technology and plug a small skills gap, or provide a talking point in interview. It helps to show you are doing additional learning and can commit to study and be self motivated. It shows those ""soft"" skills off well. It can also help with a specific project to get a few more skills and complete it well, which will  look good to your employer, but you can do that just from the learning part, don't always need to pay to take the exam. For external hiring, I think a certificate won't ever get a foot in the door but if you are interviewing anyway up against an otherwise equal candidate it can help tip scales in your balance. 

Personally I am taking AWS and Azure certs because I want to do something productive in lockdown, I signed up for a part time degree and get various credits I can spend on exams relating to the modules.

All a cert does in this case is helps you  stand out ever so slightly against those who dont have one. 

Now if everyone who applies to that position has a cert, then it becomes a de facto requirement, so the person who doesnt have a cert, is at  disadvatange.

For new grads, since lots of cs grads are getting certs, again, thise who don't have one are at a disadvatage. Because until you get to an interview, recruiters are essentially looking through a check list of qualifications.

Having said that, lots of employers generally want people who have knowledge, whether they have cert or not is irrelevant. So if you have qualifications in your resume that are better match for the position overall, they might not even care if you have a cert.

If you're young and new to something,my Certs are exceptionally useful. I had never used AWS, but I took a CCP certification.

On the other hand, I've come across people who are obsessed with their certs and really struggle to actually apply them.

Also have candidates who will mentions certs but leave off the date - tip: we don't care about your 10 year old cert because things have moved on so much in 10 years. 

Some candidates with certs are really going out of their way to learn something new and expand their horizons. Some are trying to get a piece of paper that they can forget about but show off about.

g7nl4qa,j4ibdk,"Hi, i think it depends on the country and the company you would want to work.
If you work on a IT company they want certifications in order to show to future customers that we have a lot of certificated people. Those type of customers do not know IT. So for them the certification is a proof of knowledges better than experience. It is not the truth but they think like that. So IT company request their employee to have the cert even for their tech leader who works for more than 10 years on Aws or GCP or Azure.
In some country the certification is very valuable to get a beginner job on a cloud provider. Because if you want to work on the cloud you will not be hire without cloud experience (even if you are a lead tech who never work on the cloud). 
In IT company for a new cloud project the team will be composed with People with cloud experience and few without this experience : if you show that you want to work on the cloud and have several certs you could be in this team and begin your cloud experience.

2. The idea of just collecting certifications without actually getting hands on experience is *dumb*. If you are getting certifications to get a job, any hiring manager worth their salt is going to ask you deeper questions than you can answer by passing a multiple choice test.  Why wouldn‚Äôt you actually take the time to do some practical side projects?

4. I have seven active certifications. For the ones I took after getting experience in the relevant areas, I knew they only scratched the surface. For the ones where I got the certifications before I got the experience and then started digging in and actually started using them, I was still just as lost when I first started them.  

For example I looked into getting the Big Data cert when that was still a thing because I had experience with DynamoDB, Redshift, Athena, S3 and I was learning ElasticSearch. I bought a 20 hour course just on ElasticSearch because I needed it for a project. The *entire* ACloudGuru certification course was 13 hours. The ElasticSearch section of the ACG course was 13 minutes. How could the Big Data cert show that you had any competence? Should I have hired someone to manage and architect around our Redshift/S3/ElasticSearch product based on them having the certification knowing how relatively little they needed to know to pass? 

5.  I *always* emphasize experience is the most important. How many articles have you seen ‚Äúget your Solutions Architect certification and you can make six figures!‚Äù and then people are disappointed that they don‚Äôt get any interest from jobs?

At its core, the decision to hire is similar to evaluating a major purchase in terms of carefully considering the pros and cons. Using a bad car analogy your cert might be the free sports trim package. 

If you are evaluating two car options one of which was obviously a better fit to your requirements and a better deal, the free sports trim will not change that decision. 

If you are evaluating two things of identical value and you need to really justify one over the other, okay well the free trim seems like a good deal. 

In the same way, the certification could push the decision in your favour if they weren‚Äôt really sure about first second third picks. If you were applying to a job against someone who has demonstrated the ability to get projects done, and you came in with absolutely no history, the cert wouldn‚Äôt matter.

g7i362z,j4bxia,"Full disclosure I create AWS Course at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io)

My normal suggestions is that for 99% of people... the right starting point in the solutions architect associate. It's a broad cert, which covers the architecture, features and integration options of all of the core products and services.

There is the cloud practitioner as well, but IMO it's a pointless one. It's not well regarded by most employers, and is very high level. Even for newcomers to AWS i generally suggest skipping this one and going to solutions architect associate directly.

Cloud practitioner is also a subset of the solutions architect associate and with my course for example, i designed it to allow people to start it without first having cloud prac.

From the solutions architect ... given your devops role desire you would probably be best doing developer associate, then sysops associate and then devops engineer professional.

Along the way, you may want to add various things like linux, scripting maybe some python - but none of that is required for AWS...

I would also suggest joining a community like [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) ... it has topic channels, study groups, community projects and a job channel.

I'm happy to help provide a more detail plan (no strings attached) if it helps, im Adrian on that slack.

g7iqclx,j4bxia,Is the developer certificate harder than the architect one ?,2.0
g7jvw7a,j4bxia,"no simple answer.

There is a lot of overlap, but different products/service/features are tested.

For most people the SAA should be the first one they do.... because it has an architecture focus and covers the product basics. The dev, covers certain things in more detail like CFN, API Gateway, Lambda and the CLI tooling.

For most people DEV will seem harder, but that's because for most people they will have less dev exposure before starting.

g7pguxr,j4bxia," AWS has removed the prerequisites from all of its certifications. **You can now take any AWS certification without completing other certifications first.**

However, there is a structure to the AWS certification learning paths. **It is wise to follow the learning path**, i.e. pass the foundation level first, then associate exams and finally the professional exams.  You may choose the exam at associate &amp; professional level according to your role i.e.  Developer, Administrators or Architect.

Basis your skills &amp; the need in the organization, you may take a specialty exam at any point of time, however I recommend  to take foundation level first to gain an overall view of AWS services.

SAA-C02 is the updated version of the SAA exam on AWS. The SAA-C02 includes new AWS services like AWS Global Accelerator, EFA, ENA, etc.

Although there are certain overlaps from SAA, the Developer Associate exam ( DVA-C01) focuses more on development tools like X-Ray, Elastic Beanstalk, CodeDeploy, CodeCommint, etc. Also, it is heavy on creating serverless solutions. It would be best to have a good grasp of how AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB work together.

Currently, there are no updates on the DVA exam. However, you should still be aware of the new features, changes in some of the AWS services. FreeCodeCamp has a free DVA course on youtube that you can check.

If you're looking for high-quality, up-to-date practice tests, try our [practice exams](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams/) on our portal. You can also first check our free [practice test sampler](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/free-aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams-2020-sampler/).

Our practice exams come in four modes:

* **TIMED MODE** ‚Äì mimics the actual **AWS Certified Developer Associate** exam environment under time pressure
* **REVIEW MODE** ‚Äì where you can view the answer and explanations after every question
* **SECTION-BASED TESTS** ‚Äì where you can focus and answer questions on specific topics/domains only.
* **FINAL TEST** ‚Äì We randomly generate 65 items from our entire question bank to gauge your readiness for the actual exam.

Did you watch the video?

I started with machine learning fundamentals - not even touching AWS for a couple of months, solely focussing on the machine learning side. Sure, I'm by no means a machine learning expert now - could anyone really say they are after a few months? - but I know enough that I've been able to work on real life projects that require actual problem solving and data science skills.

The first course I followed taught the calculus of neural networks from scratch, for example. I then went and implemented a basic neural network in python without any high level libraries to aid my own understanding. Bit of a stretch to call that cramming and memorisation.

Next I started working on projects involving ML at work, implementing an object detection system with a lot of optimisations and finicky implementation details. This involved data wrangling, model training, inference and building an API around the deployed model.

You have to have a solid understanding of ML to pass this cert. You will be asked to calculate metrics, suggest strategies to improve a model, troubleshoot overfitting and underfitting and know the ins and outs of each of the default algorithms as well as how to go about implementing your own.

I don't think you can readily cram for this exam. Memorisation skills are certainly helpful for some of the obscure bits of info you're expected to know, but they're not enough.",12.0

I definitely did not cram for this exam and don't encourage you to either - I focussed heavily on properly learning machine learning for several months, starting with a course focussed solely on ML with nothing to do with the exam, and a variety of real-life projects.

After I was comfortable with that I followed three separate AWS ML courses while working on a complex machine learning pipeline at work.

I'm not an ML expert at this point but to say I crammed is a bit insulting to the amount of work I actually put in. What's the point in cramming anyway? The certs may get you in the door but you're going to need to pass a job interview at some point and then actually do the work...",6.0

It's a delicate balance between positioning your content effectively versus coming across too strong, especially with an audience like reddit who like to consider themselves immune to marketing (I know this because I fit that definition myself...). But the truth of it is, people are more likely to be intrigued by claims like the ones I make in this post title - all of which are true, by the way - and therefore more likely to watch the video and learn something than if I was more neutral about it.

g7o3yi5,j3hqj9,"&gt;Are your videos monetized?

Nope, there are minimum channel size requirements for that. I'm currently about 5% of the way there in terms of subs and view hours. I'll cross that bridge when I get to it but assuming I'm still going strong producing content by that point I'd definitely consider monetising. A bit of side income would be great motivation to keep making videos like this on a regular basis.

&gt;It seems like you‚Äôre more interested in click bait titles for your own ego rather than genuinely wanting help people.

Well, I'd love nothing more than people to message me telling me I helped them accomplish a difficult goal, or helped them decide on a path to follow. And of course that would stroke my ego if that happened - I know this because it has happened and it's impossible not to feel great about it. The two are inseparable, why not just have both? Others benefit, I benefit, it's literally the definition of a win-win situation.

And I'd argue that these aren't click bait since I did everything I said in the title, and none of it is misleading. Click bait would be if I said I got them all in a week, or got a perfect score, or something along those lines. People click the video because it looks interesting, and then hear about exactly what they are told they will hear about.

&gt; I personally feel like you can‚Äôt make the argument that you‚Äôre marketing yourself to help people.

Me in particular, or in general? Marketing is just a collection of strategies for promoting products and ideas, and it's amoral in the sense that the product or idea could be beneficial (like meaningful professional development, or exercise) or harmful (like smoking, or highly processed food).

I feel that I'm helping people with these videos, they seem to agree, so I see more people watching them (who fit the right demographic) as generally a good thing. The only variable that's not certain here is whether the benefits of humility (small, trusting audience) outweigh those of self promotion (larger but less trusting audience). I try to have both but like I said it's a fine line.",3.0

Too many people spend time collecting certificates instead of getting real world experience. You took a good first step.

Then you might enjoy Amplify as a front end developer.

You might as well add Docker/Fargate to your tool belt.

g74a9rl,j283bd,"Definitely second all this. It's worth getting to know AWS inside out for the things you actually want to do with it - after all you're using it for a reason, right?

Learn Lambda, SAM, maybe Serverless Framework if you want another point of comparison.

Then learn ECS and get good at distinguishing when containers or serverless are more appropriate.

Learn the Code\* suite, then learn another CI/CD tool like Jenkins or CircleCI.

Learn CloudFormation inside out...

At that point it may be worth going for Developer Associate and/or Solutions Architect Associate. Lots of cloud jobs require them and you'll have many of the foundational skills required. For that I'd recommend Adrian Cantrill's course at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io)",3.0

OP mentioned an interest in development oriented technologies so that's the area I've recommended - Lambda, SAM, ECS, CloudFormation etc. Perhaps CircleCI and Jenkins is a bit far. But at the end of the day AWS fits into a much broader ecosystem of technology and if you want to get good at it it's worth learning the surrounding pieces as well at least to a basic level.

I've worked with plenty of developers and founders who have gone the exact path I described and done very well from it in terms of being able to execute a vision using AWS. I'm mostly sharing my own experience from \~2 years of working with AWS and related tech. I've mildly specialised into DevOps coming from a software engineering background so I definitely have some bias in that direction.",2.0

g79tbnb,j283bd,"Speaking out of personal experience, I did the CCP + all associates within around 2 months of each other, then gave it 15 months or so of hands on practice before I started working towards the professional and specialty level certs (which I'm doing now).

You could do something similar in terms of waiting a while to get the associate certs, but anywhere over a few months is probably overkill. If you're using AWS on a regular basis, just play around for 1-3 months or so and then when you feel the time is right go for the certs.

Associate level certs certainly aren't easy but they're not something to get hugely worked up about - having passed the CCP you could probably study for 3-4 weeks and pass your SA associate exam. But having extra experience will make you feel more prepared. Not to mention the point of certs is to affirm a certain skill level, not to just cram.

I have a YouTube channel where I discuss these certs and my experiences with them. You may find some of these videos helpful - I haven't done any videos on the associate level certs yet, focussing mainly on the specialty and professional ones, but I'm thinking of covering the early-stage certification process soon.

If you fancy joining [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) and throwing me a message ""Adrian"" i'd be glad to take a look at your resume and give you some pointers. I'm not a fan of the whole cloud resume thing, or building portfolios.. i genuinely believe in focussing your energies on learning the foundational theory and practical skills about the tech stacks that you want to work in.

The slack above has a few things which might help ... a jobs channel, community projects and some study groups. one of the best ways to learn, is to help others, so if you jump in and start getting involved I've no doubt it will help

I also make these available for free [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) some advanced demos you can get stuck in with... take them slow, work to understand each and every thing you do and it will help a lot.

Otherwise, for tech positions, focus on entry level. But I think you'll not have an advantage in that space because you're competing with college grads with impressive projects and education, who will also work for cheap btw. Your resume will not make the first cut, screening by recruiters. 

Well the only other option is fake it before you make it. Companies want people who have done the thing before, but what they really need is someone who can do the job.",1.0
g77yy30,j1hgbo,"I would suggest looking at helpdesk / ops /support  work that could potentially involve some of the skills somewhere in the organization.  Look for general jobs like ""tech support"" and get a RHCSA, Network +, etc so you have some example that you have basic tech support and Linux skills. Then you potentially have the chance of moving up one day, you can keep learning, and keep adding to your experience. Most places want experience right out of the gate, even if you know all the things. If you are really a wizard you might have the opportunity to practice with some of that stuff at a lower salary point, which will give you the experience to get a job at a high salary point (most cloud jobs).

g6vudcw,j0xm7p,"I have taken two proctored exams thus far and had a couple different experiences. First advice I can give you is do it in a room where no one will enter it or that you could lock at least. You want to be alone, from what I've heard and read you can be eliminated just for someone walking in the camera screen so I would just isolate yourself as much as possible. Also I recommend doing it in a room without a lot of extra monitors, they can have you go through and unplug them all, I've only read about this happening once.

The waiting to check in process can be quick and painless or long and make you think something is wrong and almost cancel and reschedule your test. They tell you in the comment box if something is wrong they will either reach out to you from a chat box or on your cell phone, however at this point you are not supposed to have your cell phone on you so after about 30 minutes you might wonder if they attempted to contact you. Regardless stay waiting until a chat box pops up.

My first test they came on within minutes, my second exam I waited almost an hour and they said that they were very busy that day and it is why it took so long.

I don't think any paper is allowed.

When your done they make you take a survey then tell you either PASS or FAILED no score. During this time if you pass you might have the urge to run and get your phone to take a picture of this. Well you are still being recorded so i advise not doing this. I did do this, ran back into my room realized i was still being filmed, proceeded to throw my phone across the room and then closed my exam. 

All in all it has been a great experience for me just being able to test in the comfort of my own home. I have heard pros and cons and waiting almost an hour sucked but passing me SAA-C02 made it all worth it.

g73ez95,j0xm7p,"Assume the setting appropriate for an important *job interview*. If you were interviewing for a job you would **not** want:

* to be rushed by bodily functions.
* to be in an uncomfortable location or situation.
* to make odd, embarrassing noises.
* to talk out loud to yourself.

A lot of things we can't control but usually finding a quiet, distraction-free corner of a dwelling for two hours isn't too difficult if preparations are made ahead of time.

Give yourself time to prepare the location and make sure to be early so you have time to set everything up according to the proctor's instructions. They are really patient.

They will ask you to verify via the phone or laptop camera, that there are no other work surfaces, notes, beverages, people, etc. in line of sight once you are seated. You will be monitored with a laptop camera. It sounds rough but it is pretty easy once you settle down a bit and start the test.

g6x56m8,j0vsck,"I agree with /u/tavibacala \- at a high level a cert has 3 real functions

1 - it lets you keep score

2 - it's good for employers and partnership agreements

3 - it gets you into interviews

Performance from that point onward is about real world skills .... can you DO the job you are applying for.

One of the key differences with the way i teach my students is that i don't really focus on the cert as a goal ... we learn how to DO that particular role, and then pass the exam as a result.

I've created a lot of advanced demos as part of my courses which i released for free ([https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs)) and i've suggested that anyone after passing the exams pick one... go through it slowly.

\- understanding everything you click

\- understand everything you type

\- understand WHY you are doing it, what happens if you DO it, and what happens if you dont

That way, the demo becomes a good stand-in for job based experience. Ive had several students get jobs because they've talked through this kinda thing in interviews.

There are no guarantees - but what you shouldn't be doing is passing a cert, and then feeling like you can't DO the job ... the whole point is to learn enough as you go to actually function in that role..... at least in my opinion.

If you want some  specific suggests [u/Otherwise-Diet-8634](https://www.reddit.com/user/Otherwise-Diet-8634/) give me a DM, or join [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) and DM Adrian on there and i'll do what i can to help.

I took architect associate exam few months ago and had a pretty much the same experience. I learned the exact same two things out of my whole experience: 1: Organization and 2: time.

I barely passed the associate exam (I think I had like 780). And pretty much asked myself every other day why am I even learning this.  Some things were straight forward for me, but for majority of the things I literally had to go through rabbit hole after rabbit hole to figure what in the world that tech was. For example, I think I spent like a whole week trying to understand how or why microservices architecture is better than monolithic. I had never heard of Json before.

I struggled with his pace sometimes as he would go really really fast and not mention tiny details such as the Linux commands he uses. It takes two seconds to say what Echo or cat commands does on Linux but he just speeds through them and most of the time I felt like it's just reading from the slides.

And your assertion no one is recommending Adrian's courses anywhere other than Reddit is incorrect. I have recommended them myself, on LinkedIn and Twitter, and to my coworkers. And I'm not the only one doing so.

The bottom line with any of these online courses is this:
Everyone has their own preferences for pacing, style, and depth of coverage. I'm firmly in the ""I want to be an expert at actually using AWS"" camp, so I prefer the depth of material Adrian provides in his courses. I guess I never grew out of the asking ""Why?"" about everything phase of life! For those who want to stay narrowly focused on passing the exam, Maarek's course is probably more up their alley.

Dynamo DB is a serverless service and can be both scalable and elastic. RDS is only scalable because we need to provision instances.",4.0

It all depends on your objectives....your timescales for instance, i believe they are too short. My average for students is 6-8 weeks given 1-2 hours a day study at the associate level, but thats to learn the topics AND pass the exam... obviously adjust that based on deviation from average skill and more or less than 1-2 hours a day study.

The distinction id argue for a public subnet is 2 fold (IPv4 only):

1 - it has an Elastic IP/AWS owned Public IP (unless you‚Äôre doing BYOIP which is a totally dif subject) associated with it. 

2 - the route table the CIDR subnet is associated with has a default gateway (or some sort of public static route) to an attached IGW.

As a comparative , you need IPv6 addresses that are natively routable our AWS through an EGW as they won‚Äôt nat the IPv6 space.",1.0
g6luev8,izdrsp,"Hey i never mind a good theoretical :)

So you CAN use a range which is publically routable ... say [8.8.8.0/24](https://8.8.8.0/24), and then the machines in the VPC would use that range too. But from AWS's perspective it wouldn't be treating them as publicly routable. They would still have to go through an IGW for IPv4 connectivity and that would introduce a problem ... since they also wouldn't be able to reach their real IP twin ... i.e [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) .. 

the VPC route of [8.8.8.0/24](https://8.8.8.0/24) would apply, and so say DNS to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) wouldn't work, logically.

This is an edge case which no sane person would do, but yes, as with any IP network it's possible. But conceptually... that still means your instances are using non IPv4 routable addresses in a sense, because they aren't treated as such.

I didn't really want to reply to this, because for anyone who doesn't really know networking this will seem so random...",1.0

There is a formal definition for cloud.

There is a formal definition for public cloud

There is a formal definition for private cloud

Hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private cloud.

Linking two networks like you suggest is a hybrid network or a hybrid environment, it is not hybrid cloud.

I teach my students the formal definitions based on [https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final)

And there you have it. The public ip you pass to ssh is not assigned to any of the interfaces on the instance.",1.0
g6mixgt,izdrsp,"Yep, exactly and that confuses a lot of people .. but the process isn't that complex.

so what happens is you connect to the public IP

You packets arrive at the IGW of the VPC

the IGW has a record of that instances private IP and Public IPv4 mapping

it takes your packets, and changes the destination IP from the public IP to the private one, and passes them through to the instance.

The same process happens in reverse in the other direction.(changing the SRC IP from private to public)

Thats why the exam often makes a huge deal out of 'no public IPv4 address is ever assigned to the OS interface'

A lot of content glosses over some of these foundational networking aspects which are REALLY important to become really good with AWS.

It's the reason why any data between two EC2 instances which use the public IP is more expensive ... because it doesn't JUST go between the instances, it has to go to the IGW at the edge, be translated, and come back in.",1.0
g6j7v47,izdrsp,"First of all, in AWS, subnet ranges are between /16 to /28 so [10.0.0.0/8](https://10.0.0.0/8) is not a valid subnet that you can define for your VPC.

Second, in AWS, all IP ranges are private IPs, by default. A subnet block behaves like a public subnet if it has access to the internet via the IGW. So you must define the route for that block in the IGW route table. If that block doesn't have a route to the internet, it is simply a private subnet. Instances attached to a private subnet can only talk to other services within the AWS network only. That the idea here.

P.S.- Correct me if I an wrong.",2.0
g6k2y25,izdrsp,"Public subnet is a subnet with route to the IGW. Private subnet is subnet without route to IGW. However, Private subnet can be given access to internet by adding a route to a Nat gateway. This allows outbound traffic to internet from the private subnet but blocks inbound requests.

Edit: Instances in public subnets are required to have public ip address as well. This can be created during instance launch, assigned by using Elastic IP, or auto-assigned using public subnet settings.",1.0
g6kjaxs,izdrsp,"&gt;Edit: Instances in public subnets are required to have public ip address as well. This can be created during instance launch, assigned by using Elastic IP, or auto-assigned using public subnet settings.

Thats not true, a public subnet can be public (IGW + Route + Set to assign IPv4 on launch) and an instance be explicitly set NOT to have public ipv4 assigned, thats a valid configuration.

It's not a useful configuration for most people, but its possible.

It allows you for example to have private instances and an load balancers to share public subnets, but the instances have no associated public addressing.",1.0
g6kv7gd,izdrsp,"So you're telling me that instead of having a private subnet and public subnet, you can lump both together? Instances with public ip addresses and instances without public addresses can all be in the same public subnet?",1.0
g6kvc9r,izdrsp,"that's correct yes, /u/cs50guy

You can have a public subnet (which means attached IGW, [0.0.0.0/0](https://0.0.0.0/0) route pointing at an IGW and the subnet set to allocate public IPv4 addresses) and then when you launch an instance into that subnet choose NOT to allocate a public IPv4 address.. and thats ok...

You could for example have two subnets

WEBA and WEBB (both are public)

Put an ALB in WEBA and WEBB (so the ALB nodes have public IPs)

Launch instances into WEBA and WEBB without allocating public IPv4 addresses.

That way, the ALB ONLY can connect to them, no access from the public internet and you only need the 2 subnets.

That happens all the time and its why a lot of people get questions wrong in the exam about 'what are the minimum number of subnets needed for X'

When launching an instance into a public subnet you have 3 options

Allocate Public Ipv4 Address

Don't Allocate Public IPv4 Address

Subnet Default (which is either enabled or disabled)

The flip side, a public subnet can be setup to allow public IPs but be set NOT to allocate them by default ... that's also ok :)",1.0

I can't believe you even thought about that, much less uttered that.  Like I said, it is amazing they even give the option for people to take an industry ""certification"" test from home.  Consider that when you go in, you are in an enclosed room with a proctor watching.  They require you to remove all electronic devices and lock them away outside the room.  They require you to be watched if you leave the room to use the restroom, to make sure you do not have any devices with you.  They have very purpose driven systems with monitoring to make sure you cannot do anything with them outside the testing parameters.

Threats to Linux systems absolutely exist.  Linux is not some supremely safe system.  The security of the system is only as good as the person that configures it.  But if you truly followed Linux, you would understand this already.  

I also did not say Linux was obscure, I said you are trying to use an argument of security by obscurity which is the argument that Apple tried to use for the longest time.

They have standards and qualifications that have to be met to ensure you are working in an environment secure from cheating.  If you do not meet them, you cannot get certified.  Part of this is that if you want to do this from home, you have to use what they have validated.

This is no different than having to use certain systems for a business.  Companies don't generally just let their employees show up and use whatever computer they want to.  They generally have criteria for the system, or provide their own for the employee.

You are nitpicking about a small detail that affects a very small percentage of people and you started off by aiming it at the wrong company.  You then make light of the amount of effort it would require for them to allow that.

The reality is, if you want a company to do something, to make a change, you need to get enough people to make noise about it.  So if you don't want leverage, then you really don't care that much about it changing.  Which means you are just complaining for the sake of complaining.",1.0

There were no issues from my side as I could navigate through the session window and did not have any WiFi issues also. I didn't know if that was even allowed. I asked the proctor to tell me the steps to do that. But somehow, my session was closed midway of our conversation.

When I raised a case with Pearson Vue they came to the conclusion that I had moved out of the webcam view. I mean why would I do that, if I am about to finish the exam.

Here are some supplementary materials that you can check for your review.

1. [AWS Security Practices](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Best_Practices.pdf): This paper supplements your study on the AWS services and features such as IAM, Security Groups, NACLs, etc. You should read this paper since security specific questions occasionally pop up in the exam.
2. [AWS Storage Services Overview](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS%20Storage%20Services%20Whitepaper-v9.pdf):¬† This paper supplements your study on the different AWS Storage options such as S3, EBS, EFS, Glacier, etc. It contains a good detail of information and comparison for each storage service, which is crucial in knowing the best service to use for a situation.
3. [Building Fault-Tolerant Applications on AWS](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-building-fault-tolerant-applications.pdf): This paper discusses the many ways you can ensure your applications are fault-tolerant in AWS. It also contains multiple scenarios where the practices are applied and which AWS services were crucial for the scenario.

### New SAA-C02 AWS Services that you should prepare for:

For the new exam version (SAA-C02), you should also know the following services:¬†

* [AWS Global Accelerator ](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/)
* [Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) ](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/)
* [Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking-ena.html)

I took the prep course at LinuxAcademy last year and started on the Solutions Architect Associates lessons before getting sidetracked. I also did some lessons on Google cloud a couple of years back. And a bit on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

Where I work, they jumped around with where we might go so I was poking at different cloud tech. Recently we got word, officially, Azure and AWS. Since I just completed my CKAD exam last Monday, I jumped back on AWS. My background, dabbling in cloud, and the course just aligned things right up.

We pretty much run our own cloud for ourselves but its needed for the amount of employees and locations we have. Its been an incredible experience.

g6akcst,ixwkaf,"Hey I passed the Sysops SOA-C01 yesterday with 916. 


Also an important note, the amount of learning material for sysops is way less than SAA. No single Udemy course will fully prepare you for it . Your best friend is the AWS documentation for the core services. Sysops is a tricky exam, you need to troubleshoot and have a good memory mapping of the relationship between different services. If you go into the exam just doing Udemy you may barely pass but that's a big risk. Also Jon Bonso tests are great but don't cover all the scenarios which again is impossible to cover given the breadth and depth of AWS


I am going to write a detailed post on my preparation experience for sysops. Hope that helps you

It is true that Sysops and SAA have a large overlap. But the approach to study is completely different. Sysops questions are more troubleshooting based and test you on the depth of the service while SAA tests you more on architecting a solution by selecting the right services.

You haven't mentioned the course you have taken.But whichever course it is, the core topics are bound to be similar, doesn't mean you know 80% of the sysops required knowledge already. I took Stephane's SAA and then his Sysops, the core topics are same but Stephane also includes stuff that is necessary for sysops, it is just not visible if you look at the udemy curriculum. Some topics like Route53 are copied directly from SAA. You can skip those if you are fully comfortable",3.0

SoA is deep dive into operations pillar and touches upon rest of the pillars in addition. For eg: SAA explains you all about S3. SoA dives deep into bucket policies, Authentication, OAI etc. Similarly in VPN, it majorly tests you on VPC flow logs, NACL rules.

Yes it takes longer but the goal should be to learn AWS not just pass the cert because in a CSA position you wont be answering A,B,C or multiple choice, you will need to know why you use Role when SSH into an EC2 instead of your access key or using MFA delete/versioning when creating new users.",1.0

Don't. They're awful unless you're in a tiny org with a handful of people that rarely change and only one or 2 aws accounts.

Much better to use a federated authentication provider and roles. Even if you use AWS SSO and or Cognito as the auth provider (if you dont have some other sso solution you can use).

When you start, roles seem confusing. But when you get the hang of assuming different roles it is a much nicer way of managing security and more like the way AWS services authenticate themselves.

There are only 2 excuses for an IAM user. Ses credentials and non AWS services that need permissions to do stuff in AWS. (Like on prem servers making calls to AWS)",1.0

The paid version of ExamPro is the up-to-date version of the course. I'm going to be doing a re-release of the Certified Cloud Practitioner before the end of the year as the 2021 version course. 

On the ExamPro platform, we have the old and updated content. You only need to do the new content. When the new content was inserted into the platform, it was supposed to replace the old videos but my content person was lazy and added instead of replaced the old content. So it's just something I have to adjust when I have a moment. 

The freeCodeCamp video is only slightly dated and will cost you a few points here and there. People seem to be passing with the old content, which is great. 

After I completed the Oracle Foundations and Azure Fundementals I found there were good foundational concepts I should carry over into my CLF-C01 and so that's what I updated my course with to make it easier for beginners to get started. I also expanded the technology section since AWS has way more services now.

Everyone starts with the SA, then you can get the DVA shortly after. By that point, you should have a solid understanding of AWS by that point but here‚Äôs the tricky stuff....

Getting these cloud certs will not get you a job in cloud without experience in IT. Everyone needs to pay their dues with IT and doing some sort of support or help desk role for the first year or so. 

I would look into getting the CCNA as well since that‚Äôs highly valued in IT. You could use your current IT knowledge to get into a support/help desk role or get your good in the door. Achieving these high salaried AWS jobs is quite difficult and usually comes after 5 years of experience or more.

g64tyqx,ix4byf,"So I passed my Solutions Architect exam yesterday and I bought both Stephane's and Cantrill's courses. I ended up completing all of Stephane's course and only getting through about 25% of the Cantrill course.

A lot of people say they prefer Cantrill's course because it is longer and more in-depth than Stephane's course, but I actually preferred Stephane's course because it was shorter. I generally don't find a lot of use in online video courses except to learn the basics of the topic, most of the actual learning for me comes from taking the practice tests and then reading whitepapers on the topics I don't know well enough. So for my personal learning style, short and to the point lectures like Stephane's works best for me, and I start to lose focus if the lectures are to long. I did go through a little bit of Cantrill's course and for my own personal preference I found it way to lengthy. If I recall right he spends like 45 minutes worth of video just going over DNS at a very detailed level. Knowing DNS to that degree is great, but it not necessary for the exam, and I was familiar enough with it from working in IT for a few years.

Both courses are great and both teachers are really good, you won't go wrong with either one of them. It just depends on your learning style and what you want out of a course. I preferred Stephane's course, but you might like Cantrill's better.",7.0

My experience during COVID has been good and bad. I moved to a new city for a new job shortly before the lockdown, and then a couple months after that I was hired on to my current role. It's been an extremely isolating time of my life, but also a period of career growth. So... pretty bizarre. I'm not complaining though; the pandemic has been hard on most (although I do get a bit annoyed when I hear people telling me how good/great things are for them). 

On the certification front, I did the SA Developer and SysOps exams, and I'm currently studying for the DevOps Pro exam (I already have the SAA and SAP). 

Certifications don't look bad if you have no experience. They can seem a bit silly though. If you have absolutely no experience in IT, and yet you have your SA Pro certification, it will be interpreted by many as more than a little ""cart before the horse,"" if you know what I mean. It makes more sense to get foundation level certifications and work through an admin -&gt; engineer -&gt; architect path; if you do SA certifications right off the bat you'll end up with a ton of holes in your knowledge.

g64lu6o,iwjeua,"I guess it depends on what you studied.

If you have an IT/IS degree I would look for an entry level IT position; avoid helpdesk if possible but take it if it's the only opportunity available. You can get your Comptia certifications to help you get your very first IT job, but after that they aren't really helpful.",2.0
g64sqz3,iwjeua,"For CS folks, I would say due to tough competition its almost a must have, unless you have other overpowering qualifications. What I mean is that when I was screening resumes in my company for interns, an overwhelming number of candidates already had at least 1 aws cert. These were Bachelors or Masters students. If most people in that pool have a cert, then you would be at a disadvantage not having one.",2.0
g68uzc8,iwjeua,I see. I‚Äôm currently an IT student about to graduate. I currently hold my SA cert while almost done studying for Developer as well. Junior cloud roles are hard to come by. I was wondering what else I could that could help me land a position without having to necessarily start from a help desk position.,1.0
g6937r3,iwjeua,"Cloud roles from the get go seem very unlikely to me, but some people manage to skip help desk and start in an admin role of some kind. I was able to. It's generally a combination of pure luck, being able to convince a hiring manager to take a chance on you, and showing the initiative to learn and do a few entry level certifications on your own. I also completed a 1 year IT diploma program that was pretty comprehensive.

My advice would be to work on the entry level certs that are respected by the industry (CCNA, RHCSA for example). Also, learn things all system admins are expected to know: hardware, networking, linux, programming &amp; shell scripting, security, and databases. 

I'm sure you're well on your way there, with what you've covered thus far in your IT studies. I've been through it all myself so feel free to DM me.",2.0

g64mhrd,iwjeua,"Even 4 cert is far too broad a scope IMO. In real life, you're either an Architect in which case SAA is enough, or a Developer in which case ADA or ADP is enough or an Ops person in which case you might benefit from 1 or 2 of the 3 associate certs. Doing all 3 without a real purpose is a bit of an issue, because it lack a focus area. 

If you do make it to the interview, having a good story to tell on why and how you did it, can help counter all these problems, but thats if you do make it to the interview and are able to  tell a good story that the interviewer can relate to. 

If you do a cert, because you were working on something and the cert would help the project or something like that, then that would be an ideal position to be in.

The other side of this equation is that if everyone who applies has 1 cert and you have 3, that puts you at a ever so slight advantage. Having a cert guarantees that you have a certain baseline knowledge, that they don't need to interview you for or train you if they hire.",1.0
g64mv0u,iwjeua,"I disagree. 4 in my opinion is still explainable. For example, Practitioner, Architect Associate, Architect Pro, Security specialty.

Almost everyone has missed the point of the post",1.0
g64ozjt,iwjeua,"I actually agree with you. Those 4 are a good combo. My point is more towards having all 3 associate certs as part of the 4, which would be ridiculous but some people on this sub think of pursuing it. 

I also don't consider practitioner worth counting in the 4, for tech people. When you're techy enough do do 3-4 certs, practitioner is too entry level to even be in the discussion, in my opinion anyway.",1.0

g5u0n4p,ivs5a8,"If an hour a day for 24 days is too much of a commitment for you you need to step back and evaluate your methodology of learning. Obviously you set an unrealistic time commitment / pass exam ratio for your present mode of operation.

If you not taken the CCP exam, I highly suggest you reconsider taking that exam and passing ($100) because the material is very similar, just not as deep. If you *have* taken and passed the CCP (CLF-001) exam, you might want to go back and review that material more thoroughly because as I mentioned, the SSA exam is basically more of that AWS core services material -plus a lot more.

1.) Take a practice exam with no help, no notes, no open browsers.

2.) Commit to sitting through at least two (2) lectures a day, usually 2-4 hours. Take random notes, look stuff up online, read white papers till bored, youtube topics I don't get. STAY ON TOPIC OF AWS. Focus!

3.) Don't take another practice test until I'm at least 3/4 through the lectures.

4.) After the 75% mark, take a practice test *with* help.

5.) Take practice test ***without*** help.

6.) Finish lectures and go through again, possibly with different lecture material, goal is to fill in dumb spots.

6.) Repeat 4 and 5 until I consistently get low 90s % on exams.

Notes: I go through the lectures and do as much of the hands on as possible/I'm interested in doing. I try to do at least 5-6 test exams from different sources.

You can do this but you need a plan and you need to be more disciplined because its a lot to memorize.

Good Luck.",2.0
g5uk5z8,ivs5a8,"Thanks for the advice!

It's not so much that an hour a day is ""too much"" for me. I'm able to understand the concepts fairly easily as I already work as an SRE so I've worked with services like Lambda, EC2, S3, etc, professionally. However this is the first time in my life I've ever actually had to study for an exam - I left school at 15 and found my way into tech in my 20's, and have my own method of learning on the job which works for practical tasks and skills, but I struggle when it comes to memorizing facts. I'm basically very good at ""working it out"", but terrible at remembering on the spot. My employer expects me to pass the SAA by January.

I do appreciate the advice though, as a big block for me is working out an actual method of study. Posts like yours help me visualise exacly how I need to digest the material in order to pass.",1.0
g5x377w,ivs5a8,"This is very important point to be honest and every individual has own way of grasping something new information. I‚Äôll tell you my way of handing course.

I basically listen theory or lab first time in 1x speed and repeat the same thing with 1.25x or 1.50x speed. 

Sometime still very hard to digest or may be lecture has some bullet points which gets cleared in later section so I do book Mark under to revise. 

At the end I go in to revise section and re visit in 1.5x speed and 99% I gets things cleared.... still not understand I will Google it if I‚Äôm Courious to understand but if that‚Äôs a separate service I‚Äôll leave avoid for exam perspective...

In summary, I feel like rather than going 2-3 time go multiple time each section in first attempt to have solid registrations in mind..

g5yuia2,ivs5a8,"My recommendation is don‚Äôt take notes. I was also trying to do the same but it turns out with that much content to cover you will have to go through the course again completely. Instead complete the course once(don‚Äôt worry too much that you don‚Äôt understand everything right now) then try building something, like deploying a website, creating an EC2 instance and deploying the same website there, etc. Build and break things, this way you will learn why the features and options that are present are actually there. 

Go through the course again, this time hopefully you will breeze through it and get comfortable with the services. In the end if you want to have a quick revision use flash cards or cheat sheets instead of notes.",1.0

g5sodi9,ivmn23,Thank you Adrian. I will be looking to the different courses soon and just wanted to see how people have prepared whether exclusively only the tutorials or have had to dig into the user guides as well.

g5soj4k,ivmn23,"I think the key points to be aware of in this space. There are a lot of materials which aim to 'fake pass' the exam. If you want to quickly get the cert thats one thing,if you want to learn skills which will give value later on .. i.e REALLY learn AWS then thats another.

Im not a fan of study guides or anything like that personally. They date too quickly (its the reason why i self-studied and now i create courses which im OCD about keeping up to date).

A ***substantial portion of that catalog came from the LA platform (in fact, more than 200 courses were migrated from LA to ACG***, many replaced ACG courses on the platform for similar reasons we will get into in a moment). So, a good number of the LA courses exist on ACG as is.
* There were ACG courses that were migrated to the LA platform and, in some cases, they replaced LA content. The reasons that a course from EITHER platform would replace the other would be related to currency, ratings, branding, engagement, popularity, or notoriety. in most cases, it would have come down to currency and ratings (we want everyone to have the most up to date content we have available).

The good news is, we have been working hard to combine the best of both organizations so that you can decide what material you can consume to meet your goals. ACG was known for creating shorter courses that were targeted directly at teaching you what you need to know to pass the certification exam. LA content was known to be longer form, hands-on content that would also provide context for real-world application of that knowledge.

Going forward, you will have access to either or both. Certification courses now are being built as you would expect (only they will now also have the Hands-On labs and cloud playground/sandboxes for practice), but there is also the deeper dive material to support those certification courses. Now, we have some work to do in order to make clear which deep-dive courses support which certifications (which follow the major domains in an exam), but that is all underway, we just are not 100% there with everything we would like to have done and we need to be more deliberate in clarifying how that will look on the platform.

The point is that regardless of which platform you came from or which you preferred, you will see the best from both present in our content going forward. If you JUST want to pass a certification, just take the certification course. If you need a deeper dive in a particular section within a certification course, the deep-dive will allow you to explore that topic (Hands-On).

Not everyone wants to take a 42 hour course, not everyone can prepare for a complex certification in 10 hours. Regardless of which side of that fence you find yourself on, you will find what you need, and most importantly, you are in charge of the learning journey that you find the most useful to you.

*One final note, although we may remove/deprecate a course (on both platforms) for any number of reasons, that does NOT mean it is gone. If you have the direct link to that course still (bookmark!), you can still reach the material and complete the course you may have started. If you find you have lost access to something we otherwise retired, you can contact* [support@linuxacademy.com](mailto:support@linuxacademy.com) *and we can provide the direct link so you can complete your course. We are working on a better way to deprecate and link to new/old material to provide a better transition going forward. We realize some of this has not been completely smooth for everyone and we hope you will be patient with us just a bit longer now that the migrations are complete so we can turn our attention to some platform clean up and provide better clarity about where everything is.*",1.0
g5wrdiz,ivi9nt,"Thanks u/TerryLinuxAcademy for the detailed response. That helped a little however I have some questions if I may.

1. **Just to confirm:** If you started a course on LA whether or not you have a direct link, you can still get access to the LA course by simply emailing [support@acluod.guru](mailto:support@acluod.guru).
2. What if you paid for a year long subscription to LA as well as a subscription to ACG (because you wanted access to BOTH sets of courses). Can you request access to specific LA course **that you have not yet started**?
3. If you will not provide access to LA courses that have not yet started then how do we get a prorated refund for LA subscription?",3.0
g605689,ivi9nt,"Hello again!

1. Yes, just email the name of the course you started that you no longer have the link for and we can help you out.
2. In general, no. When a course is deprecated/retired, that course may have an outdated UI in the demonstrations, it may be missing material or the material may be inaccurate. It can create too much confusion and the last thing our students need is to have to wonder or figure out how much they can trust the material in our courses.
3. If you want to discuss a refund, the support email is the same for that request as well.

Remember, both LA and ACG routinely replaced courses for the same reasons before the combination of our catalogs. Losing access to a course, particularly when another has taken its place, is not losing access to the material. You are just getting the newer courses.

g61z1fv,ivi9nt,"Thanks again u/TerryLinuxAcademy!

1. How long will the direct access links continue to work for? Do we have a deadline or will they stay active and we'll be grandfathered in for an indefinite access period? 
2. If/when you will deprecate the direct access links, how much notice will you provide and how will we be notified? Will we need to login to ACG and see a banner or something on the course landing page or will you send out emails?
3. Would it be possibly for this community to come up with a list of most requested LA courses (ie top 10) and get a list of direct links? Of course, we'd only be able to access them if we had a membership.

g61cx4t,ivi9nt,"Agreed, this has been the New Normal narrative at LinuxAcademy since the merger. I do empathize with the LA staff, having to suddenly tout the line that LinuxAcademy/ACloudGuru is amazing, when on the Community Slack long before the merger, folks at LinuxAcademy were very vocal about their differentiation against ACloudGuru. 

When I interviewed at LinuxAcademy a few years back, /u/acantril was directly cited in the interview -- as a strong differentiator, like, ""Look, we're so good, ACloudGuru staff members like Adrian Cantrill want to come work for us!"".

So to hear folks at LinuxAcademy suddenly tout that ACloudGuruis so great, and start practicing the Three Corporate Pillars of Apology, ""(1) We're sorry (2) nothing will change (3) a new team and/or effort will be put in place to make sure nothing wrong happens"" is very *very*  discomforting. This is standard M&amp;A (Mergers &amp; Acquisitions) PR strategy.

Make no mistake, I think the folks at LinuxAcademy are working very hard. But the new oppression from Bain Capital/ACloudGuru is so damn obvious.


\--


What I really worry about as with any M&amp;A, is how long the M&amp;A investor (in this case, Bain Capital) really wants out of the lifecycle of ACG/LA. Is this a ""pump and dump"" or a longer-lasting business lifecycle? Only time will tell. No amount of internal company meetings on ""strategic vision"" or ""product strategy"" or ""business strategy"" will be a guarantee. Good investors know this.

g60uqz2,ivi9nt,"We hear you, I totally understand that it's frustrating to see content changes, and maybe not in a direction you would like. The combined ACG + LA content catalogue is in flux at the moment, and we're working hard to make sure there is the same level of content you're used to seeing. 

We have been doing a huge amount of work to make sure we're creating the best content we can, and combining the deeper content from LA with the cleaner presentation of ACG. Doing what's best for our learners is really our number one priority. 

I know the certification courses that are geared towards passing the exam is not what LA subscribers are used to, and we definitely are aware of that. The issue with the deep dive style courses in the context of certifications is that while there is a good portion of people that want that deep deep content, there's an equal or larger group that just wants the information they need to pass the exam. We need to balance these things, and are actively working on ways to fulfill both needs. You should be able to see this materialize in the near future.

If you had started a course that's been retired from the LA platform you should retain access to that content. If you hadn't unfortunately you will not be able to access that content. We value your feedback and are hard at work applying the feedback we get from our learners to be sure everyone that uses our platform is served in the best way we're able to.

There's many reasons that content will be retired from our platform, a good portion of it is out of date, it doesn't meet our current standards, or the person who created it is no longer with the company to maintain it, are just a few of those reasons.

And it is very much a debate whether the ACG courses are enough to pass the exam. As I have said in other posts, I took both LA‚Äôs and ACG AWS SA Pro and Security Specialty, and there is ZERO chance I walk into both of those exams only prepping with ACG material and pass. In fact, SA Pro course‚Äôs practice exam was woefully irrelevant compared to the real exam.

Totally understand about the legacy courses or courses from instructors who have left the company. But why not just move them to a deprecated/legacy section of the course? I just don‚Äôt understand the decision to delete them.

Listen, ACG is totally fine for what they are (were). You are absolutely right that people want to take short courses that teach you the bare minimum and then walk away with an SA Associate cert.

When i see or use the term golden AMI, i assume that its been prepped for others to use.

An AMI.. is wider than this, its just an AMI (no specific prep needed).

g5pjtkt,iv639x,"This is impressive work. It's clear that you have many traits that would serve you well in an IT career.

But... I think you may have skipped a few steps, sort of like studying calculus without learning algebra. You may be able to understand high level ideas, but you will have large knowledge gaps and you will be lacking context in a lot of areas.

I would recommend skipping out on the DevOps pro exam (as you would again be skipping steps if you do this), and instead build out a well-rounded foundation of IT knowledge. Employers will expect you to have this, and it will help with filling the knowledge gaps I spoke of earlier. I would work on learning hardware, Linux, shell scripting and programming, networking, security, databases, and virtualization. Certification wise, things like A+, Network+/CCNA, Linux+/RHCSA, and Security+ will help.

I get the impression that a lot of people in this sub don't actually work in the industry; they rack up AWS certifications and think they will land a job. I've heard that this can happen, but it seems unlikely.

Alternatively you could look at learning a lower level language (lower level means that you have to do more of the programming work yourself, compared to higher level languages that abstract those details away from you) like C. Lower level languages are traditionally taught in computer science because it forces students to learn concepts that higher level languages automatically handle, and because going from a low level languages to high level languages is generally considered much easier than the other way around.

It actually gets quite a bit lower than C. Take a look at the book The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles.

g5p8oi7,iv5x9r,"For the first question, it never says anything about 30 days, so that part seems like irrelevant information for answer B.  The regulation says must keep a minimum of 5 years, after that they don't care, so you could keep it longer or delete it. If it was a maximum of five years, that would indicate that you had to delete it at five years, but could delete it sooner.  If it said exactly five years, then you would have to do what answer A says. Answer is A in this case, because while you could keep it longer that would be extra expense beyond what the regulation would require.

As to the second, I suppose it's more along the lines of On-Demand is the answer when you need extra resources and need to have it available. 

These tests always have tricky questions, but I suppose real life is kind of like that. Rarely a clear cut answer. Key is to not over think it and watching out for extra information that distracts from what they want as the answer. Good luck on the exam.",4.0

That isn't really being *cost-effective* in this scenario). **Avoid trying to invent an answer outside the question's parameters**.

These are not tests of intelligence or deep problem solving, they are mini-games set up to get people to the next level and start making Amazon some of that filthy lucre -or filter out. AWS puts up these samples just so people can get used to the *format* of the exams.

In my opinion, the Associate exams are not tests of how smart you are or even what you know. They are advertisements used as filters to prep people as salespeople for all the mesmerizing AMAZON PRODUCTS and SERVICES -to make money for Amazon. You don't get into the hard-core technical material until the Professional or Specializations certs. Don't overthink the associate exams: the most simple answer is usually the 'correct' answer.

g5oeyf5,iuzx7m,"That storage is instance store not EBS. and it is included as a package, there is no separate pricing for instance store and you cannot add more if you want it. You can only add EBS.

You need to be careful with ""instance store"". It is wiped every time you shut down.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html

So, yes you get an SSD attached but you can't reliably use it for data. It is a temp store or swap file location. (But you need to customise your startup scripts to even use it for that, (eg mkswap /dev/ephemeral0 ; swapon /dev/ephemeral0)


You're probably reading that link and thinking ""but it says if instance restarts it doesn't get wiped"". Correct. There is a difference between stop and restart.

So, you will need to give all your instances an 8G ebs even though they have 1TB of ssd. Because you can't put the OS on the SSD.

These disks are quite small in the grand scheme of AWS costs. If your project costs are that finely balanced that it makes a difference, you WILL blow your budget on some other tiny feature that you hadn't even realised was an extra cost. My rule of thumb is take compute and storage and any big service costs and add 10%.

Of course if you're doing AWS properly, your project is fault tolerant across AZs. In which case the on demand pricing is mostly irrelevant and you can use a spot fleet (coupled with one or 2 on demand instances in case there is a demand surge.)

If you use spot, any storage is quite tightly coupled to the lifecycle of your instance anyway, so whether it is a deleted on stop becomes irrelevant.",2.0

I am not saying you cant become an architect for aws at all. I am just being realistic. You will be expected to do more than just aws even in a help desk role. As an architect, nothing will be off limits. What I mean is architects are expected to know how to fix or find a solution for every problem. At my company I am expected to figure out everything with no help as an admin. It is weird because the developers at my company do get lots of help. I just dont want to see you get a cert and think you will be able to get by on only that cert. At least that hasnt been my experience. I also have like 10 certifications.",1.0

Not necessarily in that order, but you get the gist.

But try the developer route first and transition to devops if being an architect is what you really want to do. But without some hardcore experience its gonna be very difficult. Most places by far that I have seen have hybrid setups. Which means you will have to design in aws, and design and configure their on premises network as well. It should not be a huge shock to hear this. For example, if I  said to you I want to be a senior programming consultant, with no programming experience. But which programming certification will get me to my goal? My guess is the advice would be about the same. In the 90's it was probably possible to get a cert and just get paid.",3.0

To top it off they were building on Linux and the lead architect had no idea how to start a process on Linux. Expected the current working dir to be In the path and types the command to run the process and it says command not found. I tell him dot slash.

Now , i think that the main obstacle for global cloud adoption, is just the lack of information regarding how secure the cloud is , when you talk with an it consultant who doesn‚Äôt know anything about the cloud  , he says usually that the cloud is like a public github repository which is just completely wrong, when this mental will disappear.

I too  know someone who's also 16 (also not making it up) based out of Northern California who is AWS certified on the Associate level and is working their way up on the Professional side. For fun, they have set up Docker containers hosted on self-hosted EC2s as well as managed container services like ECS on AWS Free Tier (and non-Free Tier for the non-Free Tier stuff obviously). They told me last week that they're learning Kubernetes and Istio and they're even trying to learn Anthos which is obviously expensive but they're figuring out a way to leverage course credits to subsidize the cost.

On a broader note: It's really refreshing to see the newer generation adopt newer technologies. A lot of the times when you go on subreddits like /r/ITCareerQuestions (which full disclosure, I *am* a moderator there), you'll see a newbie, often times young, like you, make a thread like ""hey i'm new to IT what should I do"" and you just get these incumbent responses from usually older IT workers who say things like, ""just get an A+ and slave your way up helpdesk like I did""-- I really feel like helpdesk is no longer the best entry-point into IT especially as more development and operations teams interface more with each other. 

I'm not just talking about DevOps. In the past, IT jobs were mostly just ""hey we're a non-tech company that needs an IT department, hey we'll hire you to fix my keyboard and mouse"" but today's needs...  Well, you're 16 and just finished doing stuff on AWS so you've seen yourself in courses: Companies are digitally transforming to adopt and consume more technology services, and cloud is just one of those service offerings available for companies to choose out of many. Fixing your keyboard and mouse is barely relevant if at all to an AWS career.

For my students (full disclosure i create courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io)) normally take about 6 weeks given 1-2 hours of study per day - no matter what the level of difficulty.

I teach to actually learn how to use AWS ... not just pass the exam, so my study periods are a little longer .. but the time doesn't really change with the difficulty of the exam because the skill levels of students increase at the same time.

There is no right or wrong here - your objective isn't to pass a cert, its to obtain knowledge required to pass the cert legitimately and so you should take as long as you need.

getting the best value .. means learning all the things, not working to a specific time frame and everyone is different.

Cloud will definitely dominate the job market in the future. Even non-technical roles now are required to have some kind of foundational knowledge of the Cloud. In fact, I have a non-tech savvy cousin who's working as a manager in a big company. He just took and passed the AZ - 900 Azure exam.

If you're just starting out, check our free book about Cloud Computing. This eBook is specifically made for students and career shifters like you who want to transition to the Cloud Industry.

1) Create a great tool that interfaces with cloud APIs.  Could just be an inventory tool, or perhaps some ""glue"" that connects a third party tool that you love to AWS.  It doesn't really matter what it is, but host it on Github.

2) Update your resume.  Find a way to highlight all of the practical work you did while you prepared for your certifications.

3) Perhaps volunteer if that is an option to build some 'experience'.  AWS meetups are good ways to do this - and even if you don't live in an area that hosts them - they are all virtual now, so there is no excuse.  Get involved and publish that on your resume.

4) Be relentless in your approach to finding work.  You aren't going to win on experience - so you will have to compete on what you do know, tenacity, well roundedness (not an actual word), and just general attitude.

Ok, with that out of the way, I personally got all 3 associates certs before I got the SA Pro, and I'm currently working on my DevOps Pro. I personally believe, for me at least, that getting all three associates certs helped me tremendously for getting the SA Pro cert. While not everything is going to be in the associates certs for the SA Pro exam, nor is everything in the pro going to be based in the three associates exams, just understanding a large swath of AWS services and how they all interact together was extremely helpful. The SA Pro is also a different beast compared to the associates certs. I feel like The associate certs test you on your knowledge of services whereas the pro certs test you on how to actually use them in somewhat ""real world situations"". 

How I approach these certifications is I take what I think I'll need to know for my job and then once I have those I take what I think will be fun or ""for me"", which is why I'm working towards devops Pro now. Will I ever actually be a devops engineer? I highly doubt it, but I'm a Solutions Architect now so I got my sa pro and the devops engineer cert is fun for me.

Hopefully that's not a non-answer answer for you, but I guess a tl;dr is get the certs you need for your job or what you want to do in your near term career, and when you have those then take the certs you want to take to round out your knowledge.",3.0

But frankly, you could read many a blog post too, including this one that I wrote when I passed the exam last year: [https://blog.thecloudtutor.com/2019/03/18/Passing-the-AWS-Certified-Machine-Learning-Specialty-Exam-MLS-C01.html](https://blog.thecloudtutor.com/2019/03/18/Passing-the-AWS-Certified-Machine-Learning-Specialty-Exam-MLS-C01.html)

If you have AWS down and need some help with ML, then that is where my course is focused.  50% of the exam is about general ML concepts, and these concepts are around ML Operations, so the intuition behind the algorithms.  To put that in context, I have had PHD Maths students reach out for help as they understand the maths but not the practical side of ML that you need for this exam.  The rest of the exam is about ML in AWS, so SageMaker, and EMR Spark, and the AI services.  

I recommend that people have at least an AWS Assoc cert before starting out on this one.  so if that's you then you're ready to go!

If I can help in any way then please reach out, this is an amazing cert, and an amazing subject!

g57anmf,isal0u,"Thanks for your replies Adrian and Mike! 

The course looks really well put together! But since I believe its still in development, would it make me exam ready per se?
Also, I was wondering if taking the associate certification is an absolute necessity since I recently passed the CCP and was hoping to get the ML cert because I'm into the data science side of things. 

Inputs are really appreciated :)",3.0
g57bf28,isal0u,"You're right, the course is in early access, so people who take the course now get early access to content, a driving voice for change, and access to a private Slack channel.  New lessons are being released frequently.  

The reason I suggest people have an associate-level cert is two-fold.  First, it means you have a good foundation in AWS services and how to use them.  So for example, using IAM to secure S3 buckets and other services, the basics of how EMR works, and a launch point for using new AWS services and being familiar with how they 'usually' work. 

Secondly, the exam itself.  Speciality level exams (well most of them) are interchangeable with Pro level exams in regard to the question depth and structure.   So to dive straight into Pro level exams without having seen Asscoatte level could be quite a shock.

If you get a chance to watch the first few lessons in my course which are available in preview (free) I go into some of this in more detail.

If you're interested in studying for SAA then definatly take a look at /u/acantril's course on the subject.  I have a few students who have joined my course while taking his.  

Hope this helps.",2.0

g56tiq5,is6xg6,"Congrats! That is a good AWS Cert.

I suggest you do a AWS Specialty Cert. or go flat to get Operation and Developer Associate Cert. Until you get more experience working with Cloud solution, to jump to Professional level.

Don't let be intimidating for job description, go and apply for job. After you read the description and you see you can do 50% of what they are asking for, apply.  Amazon have a lot of job posts, but I suggest you try some Amazon partners too. Check the career webpage of this companies.

g55s3n7,is4tro,"/u/myungji83 I can only comment on me specifically. 10 years ago I lived in the UK and i had a ton of experience but very little in the way of IT certification (I was that tech guy who didn't think they added any value).

I started the process of emigrating to Australia, i needed certs, so got about 30+ in the year leading up to my move (stuff like MS, citrix, vmware etc) - this wasn't that hard because i'd used them all for a year, so it was pretty much just evidencing existing skills

It made getting a job when landing in AUS really easy ... i got SO MANY interviews and then i could talk about my real skills in that interview.

Once in AUS i decided to get all the AWS certs over time, and thats led me to becoming an instructor creating AWS courses

I know colleagues of mine who have started on say AUD $50,000 p/a (which is pretty 'meh' wage for an IT person in AUS) and 3x their wage in just over a year by gaining a few AWS certs and making some smart job moves ... each adding $$

I firmly believe a few things

1. Most $ bumps are gained via job moves, and certs help job moves massively as they help with interviews (i've seen that first hand...me, and with people I've helped out over the years)
2. Certs on their own are useless...yes they get you into an interview, but if you don't have the skills which come along with them (or should).. you will be found out. Don't fake pass exams and don't use content designed JUST to pass exams.
3. Have a plan ... 99% of people don't. They just move aimlessly between jobs, randomly get certs and thing it will help. As corny as this sounds, have a 1,2,5 year plan. What type of job you want, what experience you need, what certs that means.. and then work towards them

Full disclosure I create courses over at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) and i've been working solo since mid 2019 after working at 2 of the larger vendors in this space. My 'thing' is that i hate 'fake passing' exams so all my courses are designed to give you actual experience at being an X or a Y. (right now that's SA)

I have loads of extra stuff I work with my students on

[https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) so they can learn to improve communications, it's amazing how much benefit talking to other techs about architecture brings.

[https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) all my free demos ... certs are great but people need experience too. You can get experience in a job, via personal projects or by doing demos .. and the above repo contains loads of simple and advanced demos to work through ... stuff like advanced networking, BGP VPNs, hybrid DNS, hybrid directory, implementing a serverless app ... all for free.

Tl;dr you can get MASSIVE benefit via the process of getting certs. Certs are just the final step, its the learning process, the skills and knowledge you gain along the way which matters. If you just focus on the certs you miss out on that.",22.0
g56xkc1,is4tro,This is solid advice. Do aim to create courses for the data analytics and machine learning certifications as  well? I'd be super interested in those as I've seen your curriculum for SA and its jacked proper :),1.0

g55x15d,is4tro,In the DMV those certs are a way to get a new job if you already have security clearance.  I know of several companies in that area looking for AWS certified IT guys that are already cleared.  Hit me up if you in DM and we can talk if you want.

g588wnv,is4tro,Hey maybe you can answer a question for me if you dont mind. About at what experience level would an uncleared person be qualified enough to get sponsored for clearance by a company? Im trying to go cloud and wondering if I would NEED to go military to have a chance at a clearance. I know a clearance isn't necessary but a lot of appealing jobs have that as a requirement so it has me curious.,1.0
g58qkg2,is4tro,"You don‚Äôt need military to get clearance as I‚Äôm not former military.  It is much harder to find a company to sponsor you though.  To get to GovCloud non cleared you would need AWS, MCSE, Security+ CE or CASP+ CE certs generally, and at least 3-5 years exp or more.  Not always the case but it also takes a bit of luck to find a company willing to sponsor you.",1.0
g5d6mjd,is4tro,"This post makes me sad. I live in the DMV and have my network+, security+, CCP, SAA, CDA, AZ900, have a public trust clearance, and about 6 years sysadmin experience... and I still make damn near 20k less than this guy.",1.0
g57at81,is4tro,"I had my SAA and SAP when I started my current role as an AWS SA. It's the job I was looking for and it came with a very good pay bump. But I also had about 17 years of IT experience spanning many roles, and about 1 year of pre-sales experience working as a generalist solution architect.

Certifications alone will never get the job done. They are generally a small, but helpful piece of the puzzle. They can open doors and lead to interviews (but those interviews will generally lead nowhere without experience). Other critical areas are your experience, education, and soft skills. 

I studied a lot, and did a fair amount of hands-on work with the platform. Even so, certification experience merely scratch the surface of the platform, and it will take me a few years before I stop feeling like a novice (which is to be expected). Certain types of questions come up in the real world that certifications just can't help you with. For instance, the nuances and gotchas of particular services that are uncovered in large projects, or understanding how to position services against a competitors, or knowing how to price solutions based on limited information.

Think of certifications as the very beginning of your AWS journey, get as much hands-on practice as you can, and be very honest with employers about your experience and what you know. That way they will have realistic expectations of you and will understand when you need help.",3.0
g57dx5u,is4tro,"Im in your bucket, I have about 15+ years IT experience ranging from just about everything.  How did you land your current role? im only sitting with an SAA.",1.0
g58h79s,is4tro,"Going from a standard IT role to AWS SA directly would be pretty unlikely, because employers will generally be expecting both AWS and presales experience.

I took a generalist solution architect position before I started as an AWS SA. The role served as a stepping stone to the AWS SA role, because I was able to build my AWS knowledge and get some presales experience in it. My current role involves both presales work and delivery (hands on keyboard work, as the sales people say) work. I'm not sure how much I like presales yet, but it seems like the purely technical cloud roles don't pay as much.

You could probably move directly into a cloud engineering role, if you have the knowledge for it, and then move into a cloud architect role (non-presales) once you build enough experience.",1.0
g586ywt,is4tro,Yeah this sounds more realistic. I‚Äôm always honest about my skill set. I generally tell everyone that I don‚Äôt know everything in the world and the team around me is what makes me and that I‚Äôll eventually get it and be good at it. I think that‚Äôs how I landed my 2nd IT job. They were perfectly fine with my novice skills and very patient with me and willing to teach and train. My hope is to find another team just like that with an AWS role.,1.0

g56uhln,is4tro,"For me personally, it made me aware of how the company is utilizing AWS services and how inefficient they were (ie. Lack of auto scaling, lifecycle policys, turning off ec2 instances when not using them). So improvments are being made as well as proposed POCs to help improve the product overall. 

I can also say that the AWS certs help build a case for my promotion which I'm currently waiting for approval. **Fingers crossed**

Other than that, it makes my resume and LinkedIn more marketable so I'm getting messages from recruiters about new opportunities",2.0

g55qneo,is1nwa,"It depends if you are talking about just the certifications ... or the knowledge you should have which comes along with them.

(full disclosure i create courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) \- i say this only so you know, its not really relevant).

Many of the courses people use to get certification are aimed 100% at passing the exam, meaning they are minimal effort and super focussed. This is fine, it gets you the cert - but what then..... you have little to no experience to be able to talk about in interviews.

What I try to do is give my students the experience they need to do well in interviews. For example i give these labs away for free [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) which are also part of my SA Pro course (but in video form). Students who go through these - will have design and implementation experience of Hybrid Networking, BGP VPN, Directory service, R53 hybrid using endpoints, building a serverless app, systems manager and so on. I've had students get jobs, because they've talked about these in interviews as examples of 'experience'.

You will see people comment on this sub reddit that 'certs are useless without experience' and thats true, in part. Certs should evidence your real skills. And certs get you through the door for an interview.

If you 'fake pass' a cert by just cramming for it ... you don't get the experience and skills along with it - and that's useless for interviews.

If you already have the experience and the cert is just to evidence that, then ok, you will be fine.

If you don't have experience.. you need that, along with the cert - and thats where you need to do demos, design things, or use a course which includes that (which is one of my things).

So to answer your questions ... they are useful, but only if you have studied for them in the right way.

/Adrian",4.0
g559ffv,is1nwa,"I didn't have any external interview after the exam but it helped me a lot at work when we were discussing designs and solutions, or just the concept of solutions and reusable frameworks. So I am sure it helps if you can add value to a conversation with it. But it doesn't help you describe your previous accomplishments and that is what they usually looking for more in an interview. Except if they ask to quickly design something which happened to me before my exam.",1.0

I will say a few things

1) join [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) its a free community, lots of architecture discussions, exam practice, community projects, study groups and even a jobs channel

2) as you do the pro course do demos.

3) I'm Adrian on that slack and if i can help you with a study plan, or to explain anything, im always online (except the few hours a day i sleep UTC +10)

4) Ive designed my SA Pro course to allow continuation from SA Associate, i don't believe people should have to do all 3 associates to get SA pro, it's inefficient. Importantly though, my SA Associate course goes into significant depth so depending on how much knowledge you have retained from the associate level .. there may be some gaps to fill.

My student average is 6 weeks with 1-2 hours a day study regardless of level because while the pro is harder than the associate in theory your skill increases too.

Hope this helps, and give me a yell on that slack if you want to talk more (UTC+10 :)

g4rknya,iqdt3q,"1. Take Jon Bonso's Practice Exams. Best in the community, hands down. 
2. Review each practice exam question thoroughly, no matter if you've gotten them correct or incorrect. If you're still averaging in the mid to low 60s, then you're either not reviewing properly or those are your first attempt scores. If the latter, don't worry, as a lot of people (me included) failed the practice exams the first time around. If the former, then you really need to be properly reviewing each and every question
3. The ""small"" things you are confused about - RDS vs. EC2, Kinesis Data Streams vs. Kinesis Firehose - aren't small at all. If you've done Stephaane's courses (which I've heard are good) you should know that EC2 is completely different from RDS, and they are only comparable in certain, certain situations (i.e. when deciding whether you want to host your DB on EC2 or RDS). You should also know the difference between Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose, which is significant. This is worrying, because you either didn't pay attention during your course, or you just have a hard time wrapping your head around the concepts. 
4. If you can review 6/7 hours per day and for almost 2 weeks, that should be sufficient time to pass your exam on the 23rd (if you delay it that far back). When you're studying, **really study.** Don't have your mind wandering off or be taking a ""quick break"" every 10 minutes. 
5. Don't memorize ""everything"" on the cheat sheets provided by TutorialsDojo. One, that's near impossible (presuming you're reading more than a few cheat sheets), and two, it would be a waste of time. I'm studying for the Solutions Architect Professional Exam, and Jon Bonso (co-founder of TutorialsDojo) provides the exact same cheat sheets on his SAP-C01 practice exams to read up on. That should be saying something. Get the base knowledge down and look at guides that inform you what knowledge is actually required.
6. Hopefully you've taken notes while you watched your course. It sounds like you're new to AWS, and if that's true, then I hope that you have a document with all the information you've learned. If not then look online; there should be some really good ones. Spend time on reviewing your notes (this is what you should be memorizing) and, of course, read whitepapers, read cheatsheets, and watch recommended vids on YouTube.",5.0
g4rwbqa,iqdt3q,"Hey thanks for the answer. 

1. I have the Neal Davis ones, are they good enough? I've read they're quite good too and don't want to spend more on buying another pack
2. Yup it's my first attempt. I've only had 3 weeks so haven't had the most amount of time to get ready.
3. Think I misworded myself there. I meant smaller things in each one, no idea why I wrote it the way I did in the post. So for example there was a question today in the practice test I did on about whether it would be cheaper to use EC2 with instance stores or s3 storage, that's what I meant. I have the basics of most of the services ready to answer, it's the in depth stuff I'm struggling on. 
4. This is what I'm struggling with most. Haven't done an exam for almost 2 years now so no need for concentrated revision. Need to find a way to get past that and get into the zone. 
5. You're right. Going through the cheat sheets, there's so many it would be impossible to remember all. 
6. I do have notes but the problem is I've had to balance my normal dev job with revising. So I've had 2-3 hours maybe 3-4 times a week to get through the course. So I usually had the videos on 2x speed to get through them and I'm guessing I've missed some things which didn't seem important at the time but obviously are now. I've talked to my manager and he's giving me more time to take for revision which should be good. I am new to aws, I'm a junior dev in my first year of work and was offered the chance for a free certification and thought it would be easier then it's turning out to be.

For what comes next, I'm planning to look through the cheat sheets with my notes and include in the stuff I haven't got in there already. Then spend 2-3 days just going through my notes, revising that as much as possible. After that, do the exams again as a proper first attempt, and go over the ones I get wrong and revise the sections if I'm weak on any particular thing. Do you think that's a good plan?",1.0
g4rymsw,iqdt3q,"1. Neal's are okay, but Jon's are the best. If you don't want to buy another package, then it should be okay. 
2. Then that's fine. You should be scoring 85 or 90+ on your attempts after that. 
3. Alright, good. Was getting a little worried there lol
4. Search up the Pomodoro technique on google. Might help you
5. Yes, not all of the info is directly related to the exam
6. Yea, watching the vids at 2x is definitely not a good idea, even if you're stressed for time. It hurts you more in the long run. Keep in mind that it should take you much longer to complete the video courses than the actual total video length, as you should be constantly stopping the video and taking notes down on a doc. 

That is a good idea. But, you first have to review all the exams before you attempt them again. Go through every single question, even the correct ones. During the exam, it might be a good idea to flag every single question that you are not confident with, so when you're reviewing the exams, you specifically know what you have to spend extra time prepping on.

&gt;What other kinda of things should or can I be doing?

Practicing with hands-on labs specific to the areas your struggling with.   AWS has a GitHub repo with tons of diy workshops on just about every service - https://github.com/aws-samples

Remember, this exam assumes you have had at least a year of hands on experience building stuff in AWS, so rote memorization without actual familiarity won't do you any good.  I took the exam in 2018, and what struck me was that the questions were nothing like the ones I had done in practice tests.

Most questions are going to provide multiple answers that will technically solve the problem.

The Pro exam is difficult, though not as difficult as many make it out to be. It's more of an endurance test than anything else. The people I know who have failed, generally have been working in IT for a while and only narrowly miss passing.

The certifications don't go deep enough to be a substitute for actual experience though. The platform is nuanced, complex, and full of caveats that take time to uncover.",2.0

g4ny9zl,iq06pc,"Hey so I'm wondering about your study process in detail.

&amp;#x200B;

So for me, I went through stephane's course 1 time, did not take any notes, and did probably 70% of the labs. Then I took his first practice exam and got a 63%

Now I'm going through his course again, but this time I'm literally writing down almost every single slide in a notebook. I'm skipping the hands on labs this time. Then I will take his second practice test then Bonsos. I'm almost nearly done with Stephanes course for the second time with note taking with my exam scheduled on the 17th. But I might push it back depending on my practice exam scores. I also forked that guy's page on github because it's awesome!

Can you elaborate a bit on your process?  Just wondering if and when you actually wrote things down?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!!!",7.0

g4og52z,iq06pc,"I can tell you about mine. Anything that was written on screen for Stephane‚Äôs course, I wrote down on my computer in point form. I made separate word docs per section but writing it down helped me tremendously because now I had most of the notes that I could easily refer to later on when studying. Doing Bonso‚Äôs test really helped as well and make sure to write the answers that are wrong and why they‚Äôre wrong. Understanding key words is extremely important in questions and make sure to understand that part",1.0
g4oi9ai,iq06pc,"awesome, thank you. 

A lot of people discuss their sources for their study but dont really say their process which I think is the most important thing. Of course Stephanes course + bonso will help you pass, but only if you study the right way.  

Thanks again and this feedback makes me feel like I have the correct approach.",2.0
g4pbm5s,iq06pc,"Ya no worries! 

Having your own set of detailed notes is important for studying. But one of the best methods was understanding why my wrong answers were wrong for Bonso‚Äôs tests and understanding key words. The key words will help you pass the test. 

For example, what kind of replication is asynchronous vs synchronous. 

If a question calls for MySQL, then dynamoDB will not be one of the answers. 

If a question calls for a relational DB that‚Äôs ACID compliant DB, and MySQL then aurora could be a high chance of the right answer. 

Etc. goodluck!",3.0

g4pmnbg,iq06pc,"Thank you for the amazing details! As someone who‚Äôs taking the exam soon, I‚Äôve been scramming for details methods of how people passed! However I had a question- I also averaged 60‚Äôs first attempt on Bonso‚Äôs exam after taking Stephane‚Äôs course, then a few days later I retook them and scored in the 80‚Äôs. I wonder if your better scores were due to taking a second course or simply subconscious memory of keywords and answers in the exams? 

Asking to see if i should get Adrians course as a last step in my studies! My exam is on the 18th so I‚Äôd love any feedback! :)",2.0
g4ptjf7,iq06pc,"the answer is both.  when I was studying for S+ I was getting like 70s on the first round of practice tests and near perfect scores on the second attempt, but while I did more studying in between 1st and 2nd attempts, I also very easily remembered the answers.

The fix for this is to just do 1 practice test then do a ton of review all of the stuff you got wrong and also review what you got right that way if  you had a lucky guess, you still learn the topic. Then take the 2nd practice test and repeat all of this. By the 5th practice test you should be all set. I feel repeating a practice test offers little value and I would only be concerned about my first attempt scores.",3.0
g4q2h7n,iq06pc,"This is same approach that works for me. After Marek course took and practice test to see how many stuff my memory retain. (Low scores).

Most of our students tend to go for either the Solutions Architect Associate or Developer Associate after passing CCP but SAA seems to be more popular. I recommend taking the Solutions Architect Associate if you're planning on applying for a cloud-related job.

Since you don't have any experience yet, I suggest going for the Solutions Architect Associate and getting some hands-on experience first. There is a [free course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia-UEYYR44s) offered by Freecodecamp on Youtube if you don't want to spend any money. Alternatively, you could also purchase a course on Udemy ( check Stephane's ).

After completing the course, gauge what you know by doing practice exams. We have six sets of [practice tests](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/) for the SAA that comes with five exam modes:

\- TIMED MODE ‚Äì mimics the actual AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam environment under time pressure

\- REVIEW MODE ‚Äì where you can view the answer and explanations after every question

\- SECTION-BASED TESTS ‚Äì where you can focus and answer questions on specific domains only

Thats a huge difference right there as a starting point

Consider the specialty exams as 50% AWS and 50% the specialty subject (in this case networking)

For any specialty i normally recommend a 'pro' level in one of those things .. AWS or Networking.

So either good networking skills ... or good aws skills.

That's excluding the fact that the adv networking is easily the hardest speciality exam and most people (non network specialists) are going to find it the hardest AWS exam.

g4jane5,ipb7fy,"If you have the time, u/acantril's course i'd say is the gold standard right now. So in depth but easy to follow its crazy. Add the jon bonso practice tests and you will be set.

The only suggestion I would have for adrian is that lots of stuff is auto set up for each of the demos, by just one click deploying a cloudformation template. It would be useful to have a quick top level run through of what each one is setting up (in terms of security groups, routes etc) before doing the demo. Only as there can be a tendency to be reliant on these templates and lose sight of all the other bits that are required for these things to work :)  Only minor though.",6.0

Even after working with cloud and virtualization systems including Openstack, I can say the CCP exam is worth doing so that you can get a good grasp on how far and wide the AWS service offerings are. It's pretty complex if you don't know much about this kind of computing. There is a lot to wrap your arms around in the AWS ecosystem. CCP lays a solid foundation, as intended.

Is the CCP necessary to move on to the other certs? Probably not, but you might find yourself at a loss when you are wasting time down a rabbit hole looking for info about some random feature of a service you never heard about before. The CCP exam preps you well for what's next. I guess a lot of people fail it nevertheless for some reason or other.

OAI's are designed so you can remove all policies from a bucket, leaving the implicit deny, and then add an OAI so that ONLY that CF distribution can access it ... so the bucket can be limited and under the control of whatever restrictions you have on a CF distribution (no direct access)

SignedURL's ... allow you to access objects via a private CF Distribution (one object)

Signed Cookies ... same as above, but multiple objects, paths, file types etc

Generally ... only S3 .. presigned URLs

CF .. not presigned URLs and either signedURL or SignedCookies

OAI is just about restricting access to S3 for a specific distribution or distributions in CF.

You could in theory use S3 Presigned URLs while you are using CF ... but the bucket would need to allow the identity who generated the presigned URL to access it. If you ONLY had an allow for the OAI and nothing else, anyone generating the S3 Presigned URL would be denied.",10.0

g4e8274,iohswt,"hi /u/Glamdring85 at the associate level there are a few things

1 - there is an optional Domain purchase to make the demos more realistic ($15) this isn't required, and you can use an existing domain.

2. Assuming one run through of the demos, i think students on average use about $1 in AWS costs (there are some things like NAT Gateways which don't come under the free tier).

3. If you do multiple runs, or do anything extra there are costs ofc.

My pro course has more costs... but the demos are significantly more complex [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs)

The key thing, is that with my courses you are learning about how to really use AWS. Enterprise like account structures, cost management, shared resources, Orgs, SSO etc. So i decided to do this, rather than sandbox accounts like others ... because they are limited and prevent you learning about certain things.

The courses are demo heavy and they are real world like .. so that level of learning can cost a little more. But as above, at the associate level i've aimed for almost entirely free tier. That's why i get students to create 3 brand new accounts for the course.

Last 40+ took my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate course

No previous AWS experience.. literally hadn't heard of it days before enrolling on my course.

Studied like a machine, hard work, loads and loads of questions.

it was messy until 2 weeks in.. when i could see things start to click and then it accelerated from there.

She sat and aced the exam.

Started posting on social media, ended up getting an interview.

Unlike most people she didn't exaggerate or lie, brutally honest 'im a noobie, but ive studied hard and learned X, Y and Z, including all of this practical demo stuff &lt;details it&gt;'

anyway, fast forward a few days, she got a Junior SA role ... and is on a decent multiple more $$... and her job is secure during the pandemic too.

i have more of those ... the common theme ... don't aim for certs, aim for actual knowledge, and pass the certs as a result. Dont BS in the interview, admit you are a noobie.

/Adrian",2.0
g4azi0x,inozn5,"I can‚Äôt say my certs helped me get a job at all. But, I realize my path was part dumb luck and part just taking advantage of opportunities. 

3 years ago, I didn‚Äôt know anything about AWS. I thought it was just a bunch of hosted VMs. I was a dev lead working on two green field projects. They decided to ‚Äúmove to the cloud‚Äù and hired a bunch of ‚Äúconsultants‚Äù who in hindsight were just some old school infrastructure people who passed one exam and could click around on the console and treated AWS like an overpriced colo. 

I started studying for the SAA just so I could speak intelligently about AWS and know what I didn‚Äôt know. I knew I was going to have to dig through the SDKs to actually implement anything. 

By the time I was prepared to take the exam, the company decided it didn‚Äôt want to be a software company. I changed jobs, went back to being a developer to get some hands on experience. 

The new  CTO who hired me wanted to be ‚Äúcloud native‚Äù. I jumped onto every initiative that would let me dig deep into AWS. Less than two and a half years later, I had projects under my belt dealing with a lot of the core parts of AWS dealing with serverless implementations, dev ops, etc. 

In parallel with me getting experience and leading development and Devops projects, I was also getting certifications - six in all. The certifications solely served as a guided learning path so I would know what I didn‚Äôt know. 

A few months ago, a recruiter from Amazon reached out to me out of the blue about a software dev position at Amazon Retail. I asked about a consulting position at AWS, and the rest is history. I‚Äôm a consultant at AWS with less than three years of AWS experience. I do have a lot more enterprise development experience though. 

I just want to emphasize that it wasn‚Äôt about the certs. It was about digging in and getting experience.

when you say

&gt;prep for and pass the AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam from beginning?

It's worth noting there are a few 'ways' you can prepare for the exam

1) Cram it .... bad idea

2) Study using material with an exam focus ... faster, but questionable value after you have the cert - you won't walk away with real skills

3) Study for actual skills... and pass the exam as a result - takes longer, but more long term value.

My courses are the #3 approach, and my average is about 6 weeks .. assuming 1-2 hours a day study and an average level of general skills (but no expectation of AWS skills at the start). With this approach my students gain skills they can use in a real role, and they pass the exam as a result.

You can pass it in 2 days for #1 and 2 weeks for #2 .. but only #3 gives YOU real long-term value IMO.

g469gvz,in8112,"it depends on the course you are using and how much effort you put in.

People study for different reasons 1) to pass the exam only 2) to evidence skills they already have or 3) to learn the AWS skills and pass the exam.

Courses are designed for all of those cases too.. many courses focus on surface level stuff to get cert passes with minimal effort...

full disclosure i create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io)

As far as I know for example .. nobody has failed using my associate course... it has a (as far as i know 100% pass. rate). The average completion time is 6 weeks, assuming average skill level with 1-2 hours study a day... 

I don't really teach just to pass exams, i tech for skills and exam passes are a result. Given the right material, and right amount of effort everyone should pass 1st time really. I think many in the industry have created a culture of 'minimal' effort and this comes with a higher chance of a fail - which is a shame.

g416frd,imk9ab,"Sysops covers a lot of networking stuff as well - VPCs and Load Balancers. There is no pre requisite but people usually prefer to do Architect Associate before it. I personally don't find any use for it because I am an Ops guy myself and a lot of stuff covered in SOA, I have been doing as part of my job in an on-premises environment. I guess you have been too as a networking guy. 

The downside for you might be the Database, Configuration Management and Monitoring part that you might not have exposure to and you'll have to get acquainted with. Freecodecamp YouTube channel posted a video on SOA a few days back, so you might wanna take a look at it before deciding to go ahead.",2.0
g41cssi,imk9ab,"Thank you very much for taking the time to respond. Yeah, I‚Äôve zero database experience so that will be fun, however, having looked at the course outline I‚Äôm not put off.

g41tvz0,imk9ab,"Personally, I think Solution Architect Associate -&gt; SysOps -&gt; Networking Speciality. Since there are a lot of overlapping areas with the Solutions Architect and the SysOps but the Solutions Architect covers wider range in less gradularity and is known to be easier than SysOps (from my experience). SysOps is more focused on monitoring, troubleshooting, and some networking. Haven't taken the Networking Specialty but since you're a Cisco guy should be up your alley.",1.0

A+ is just rudimentary and I wouldn't even put it on a resume unless I had little to no IT experience and it was for a bottom of the barrel entry level position.

Net+ and Sec+ you can kinda flip a coin on if you don't know what your path will be later in life. If you could tell the future and know you'd prefer networking, net+ is a good choice.  Security+ gives you more generality and also complies with the (American) DoD 8570 Baseline Certifications, which means you could potentially grab a high paying contracting position.

4 solid hours a day could get you there in a month with no IT experience.

2) Visit his website and purchase the $10 (I think) consolidated course notes. Print them out, laminate them, and carry them around with you to review when you have free time. 

3) Its essentially bulk memorization of a lot of terms. So using flip/index cards (or anki if you know how to use the program) work really well. 

4) Find practice exams and practice taking them over and over.

g3xafzs,im0j87,"You shouldn't think of RDS and Aurora as the same product, conceptually they are almost nothing alike.

**RDS**

RDS Multi AZ is two pieces of compute, each with their own storage, replicating at the compete level synchronously between them. You have the DNS endpoint, which points at the primary ... you cannot use the slave for anything useful, it just sits there. You can also only have 2.. 1 primary 1 secondary.

Read replicas for RDS allow read scaling ... they sync asynchronously and you can use them for reads ... but you have to manage all the individual endpoints yourself.

**Aurora**

With Aurora... there is cluster storage. It's replicated at the STORAGE level between at least 3 AZs. Aurora instances (replicas) are just units of compute which consume that storage. You can have 1 of them, 2 , 3 , 4 ,5 etc. The key thing to understand is they don't have their won storage, and when added, they just use the cluster storage so are much quicker to provision.

Also... you get a cluster endpoint .. which points at the one instance which does R&amp;W, and you get a reader endpoint which load balances over the instances in the cluster.

So with Aurora you have the benefits of multi-AZ and read replicas in one ... and the cluster manages read scaling, by giving you the reader endpoint which balances over read instances.

It's faster to add and remove aurora replicas because there is no storage provision.

You can have more than 2 replicas, meaning more resilience.

And if you need it ... multi master (multi writes).

Aurora is not just 'a different RDS' it's a different animal.",7.0
g3y0qvc,im0j87,"There's too many things wrong with what you've written here...

Aurora is a set of engines that run within the Relational Database Service. Period full stop. Aurora is part of RDS not its own service.

Aurora does use a unique clustering structure which uses a primary storage cluster with compute nodes attached. These compute instances or nodes, have a writer flag which can be passed between them, and the cluster will distribute the nodes between the subnets in the subnet group that the cluster is assigned. By default if the writer goes down another node will be passed the writer flag and the cname for the cluster endpoint will be changed to point to this node.

Other engines in RDS (SQL Server handles things differently because Windows) use a warm standby for multi-az which does not run the database engine while the instance is the standby, and block level replication is used to keep the two instances in sync. If the primary fails, a failover occurs to the secondary and the failed primary instance is replaced and becomes the new secondary. A similar DNS update occurs as part of this failover.

They're not magically different. The big difference is in how Aurora's storage cluster works and what it enables.",-3.0

g3yagp8,im0j87,"&gt;, replicating at the compete level synchronously between them.

Not at the compete\[sic\] level, Not synchronous. It happens at the block level after changes happen on the primary.

&gt;the primary ... you cannot use the slave for anything useful

Might as well point out that you used half the correct terminology here, and half of the old offensive replication terminology here. Not really important except that it could confuse someone who is not familiar with the subject. And you have a reputation as a instructor, so -10 points there.

The secondary is a dummy instance sitting there doing nothing but running the block level replication. There's no live database engine on it, it's not functionally a database instance until a failover occurs.

&gt;they just use the cluster storage so are much quicker to provision.

They don't provision any quicker, and in fact are often slower to provision because of the cluster management syncing that has to occur in the process of adding them to the cluster. They still have standard block storage volumes attached to them, that store the operating system, database engine, logs, etc.

&gt;It's faster to add and remove aurora replicas because there is no storage provision.

&gt; You can have more than 2 replicas, meaning more resilience.

Again it's not faster to add and remove Aurora NODES. Aurora does not have ""replicas"" there's no user data replication that happens at the instance level. There are a few meta-objects that the cluster nodes replicate like which node is currently holding the Write flag. And yes, as I said there is storage provisioning involved just like any other RDS instance. The storage isn't used the same way as other RDS instances but take the database engine away and the configuration of the underlying hardware is identical.

The added resilience is entirely a function of how the cluster storage engine works, and is completely decoupled from the compute layer of the cluster configuration. That's why you can make any Aurora cluster ""cold"" by terminating all of the cluster nodes (with the API, CLI, or a SDK if you do this with the console it will kill the cluster completely.) And then when you need to access the database(s) in the cluster you can add compute nodes back. This also enables Aurora Serverless which adds a light weight proxy instance which handles connections and compute scaling in front of the compute layer of the cluster. 

&gt;And if you need it ... multi master (multi writes).

If it wasn't super clear that you don't know this engine yet... multi master is a bit of a misnomer, it does not handle multi-write workloads, and is more of a hot-failover technology. YOU CAN send writes to multiple instances, but it tends to blow up, like most other RDMS systems that can be configured to do this.

You happy? Did you learn something? I hope so.",-2.0
g3ycdpg,im0j87,"&gt;Not at the compete\[sic\] level, Not synchronous. It happens at the block level after changes happen on the primary.

compute, it was the typo... and you are arguing with AWS then, because they use the term synchronous replication. Are you suggesting the vendor who created it is wrong, or just me?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Might as well point out that you used half the correct terminology here, and half of the old offensive replication terminology here. Not really important except that it could confuse someone who is not familiar with the subject. And you have a reputation as a instructor, so -10 points there.

Master/Primary Slave/Secondary, both well known words, both valid in their usage. You seen to be stretching for things to be wrong if you are commenting on a typo and correct term usage.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The added resilience is entirely a function of how the cluster storage engine works, and is completely decoupled from the compute layer of the cluster configuration.

Again, i didn't say anything otherwise. I was discussing aurora... that includes the compute and the storage components and so saying it offers improved resilience is correct. But factually you aren't correct since from a failover perspective MySQL RDS for example offers a primary and secondary in 2 AZs.. aurora can from a compute perspective offers 3 AZ resilience. That's independent of the storage layer resilience.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If it wasn't super clear that you don't know this engine yet... multi master is a bit of a misnomer, it does not handle multi-write workloads, and is more of a hot-failover technology. YOU CAN send writes to multiple instances, but it tends to blow up, like most other RDMS systems that can be configured to do this.

Not correct, multiple instances can write at the same time. it doesn't provide advanced mitigation of write conflicts, but assuming you are not writing to the same data page you can perform writes at the same time. Again this is based on my experience and what AWS state themselves, so you are arguing with the vendor, and someone who has used it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You happy? Did you learn something? I hope so.

All you have proven here is your personality. I asked you to cite things, to show evidence of a vague and invalid set of comments and all you are trying to do is brute force an argument win.

g3wjpsn,im0j87,"With RDS, you have a main instance and a stand-by instance which is only for resilience / failover.  You can't use the stand-by instance to read data for example.

1) AWS Documentation and FAQS ‚Äì with a strong focus on RDS (includes Aurora, not necessarily VMWare), DynamoDB, and a bit on DocumentDB, Redshift, ElastiCache (Redis), Neptune, and QLDB. During my exam, it was 70% on RDS (includes Aurora)   

2) [AWS Support ‚Äì Knowledge Center](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/) ‚Äì Many questions from the exam will be based on how well you understand the body of thought surrounding the questions posted here. When you get stuck in understanding which areas to study further, check them. Particular focus on the **Database section**, **Amazon Redshift, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail.**

My tips:

\-Don't forget about the Well-Architected Framework. In most questions, a lot of the choices are possible solutions, but the keywords in the question are critical to separate the best from the rest.

\-Think like AWS. Even if AWS works with a lot of technologies, they'd want you to focus on the features that make AWS such a great product. e.g. why use the native backup and restore method, when you can use a snapshot?

\-make sure you can distinguish how Aurora is different from RDS (MySQL and PostgreSQL)

full disclosure first - i create courses for AWS at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) \- this isn't relevant, but i want you to know about a potential bias.

I think firstly, its useful to split things up a little

when studying ... you can study in one of 3 ways

1) Exam dumps - cheating the exam

2) content focussed on the cert - much narrower than #3 below, and focussed on surface level education for JUST the exam

3) Learning to be a X (SA for example), pass the exam as a result.

The thing is.. many people think #2 is efficient ... I don't agree, the knowledge you gain is narrow and artificial. Not only is it not good for real world usage, but its suboptimal in the exam, especially if it changes or questions are asked in a slightly different way.

Study method aside... also understand that knowing AWS.. and being good at exams is two very different things.

So your situation is either

1) you aren't yet good enough with AWS

2) you are bad at exams.

We can fix both, but the tactics to fix both are radically different.

Let me ask you to check out these links

[https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html](https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html)

and

[https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course](https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course)

Read through them and then let me know how you feel ... do you know most/all whats on them? or do you have a 'WTF' moment. If its the former, you are bad at exams, the latter, your AWS skills need work.

In both cases. i would suggest [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) we have study groups, exam question breakdowns and i think it would be beneficial just to join that.

If your exam technique is bad, thats fixable, but we need to be very targetted. For example, you mention getting bad results on tests, ok... so what then ?

What.i normally suggest is 

1) record all the questions you get wrong

2) group into area ... compute, storage etc

3) pick your worst area

4) review every question with the same process

4a) confirm why you picked what you picked

4b) why were you wrong?

4c) why are the right answers, right

4d) what keywords, or facts did you miss in the question which led you to pick wrongly

4e) record all of this information down, ideally attached to a screenshot of the question &amp; answers... use this as a flashcard of sorts.

5) repeat that process for all questions in all areas.

You might just be doing what most humans do... rushing through questions, skipping key facts, skipping 'NOT' statements. And thats fixable with practice. Or you might now be absorbing the AWS knowledge well enough .. thats also fixable.

I would say I know most of them, but on a surface level. Like I recognize the terms and acronyms and generally know what everything is related too. But then using them in the level of detail the test is asking is an issue. I would say it is probably that I don't know the stuff in enough detail. I don't have tons of experience with AWS, so it is experience and knowledge issue. Like it just feels like I am drinking from a fire hydrant taking in all this I guess. So it is probably a combination of study technique and things similar.

I think I can combine what your second suggestion is with what the person below suggested. As in, focus on one area for the practice tests and treat is like flashcards. Seems the Tutorial Dojo thing I got does break down sections as well, so can do it that way. I know the test I took broke down what I did well and not well in. Basically get good in that area on the test and move on.

One other thing that I know would help but I just feel I don't even know where to really begin is working on some project using all the AWS stuff I have learned about. I have taken your course (it is the second one I took) and it is very good. Went through your tutorials, uploaded the cloud formation templates and followed along. I only stopped doing it slightly towards the end out of time constraint of wanting to get this test done by this month. But the majority of them I did follow along on my own account. I probably wouldn't normally cut that corner, except I felt I did some of the stuff being reviewed in a previous course.

Just sort of not sure a good project to try for that utilizes all that.",1.0
g3nkkxi,iktb5s,"I don't think you are thinking about it 100% correctly.

If you just know the tech on a surface level like you suggested above, then focussing on flash cards and the jon bonso exams is just going to continue that surface level thing.

You mentioned the linux academy course originally.. i create that one. Did you follow all of the demos and theory? focussing on actually learning the stuff. Have you created multi-tier custom VPC's over and over, have you done the docker &amp; ECS demo over and over until it sticks? what about the serverless app demo?

If not sure if you have done my new course? or someone elses? but have you done the demos in that course?

I think you should be focussing on bringing your AWS skills from surface level, or a good deep level of knowledge.

It sounds like you are so focussed on the exam, you are avoiding the requirement to actually LEARN the tech stack end to end. My comments on exam technique are ONLY when you actually know the tech.",1.0
g3qzbdx,iktb5s,"Yes, I followed the demos up to a point in the first one. But then stuff wasn't working after a while (I think some may have been out of date or older screens, hard to follow), so I just started watching at that point.

I got your new one though and did follow those until very recently towards to end when I was aiming to take this exam soon. Then I failed the practice exam...so realizing I don't know as much as I think.

&gt;Have you created multi-tier custom VPC's over and over, have you done the docker &amp; ECS demo over and over until it sticks? what about the serverless app demo?

I have done each demo once (with your new course) in your course except towards the end videos, following along with them and using the Cloud Formation template with a lot of them (as they build on each other, so it was used to save time as was mentioned in the the tutorial).

&gt; It sounds like you are so focussed on the exam, you are avoiding the requirement to actually LEARN the tech stack end to end. My comments on exam technique are ONLY when you actually know the tech.

Yeah, I agree with your strategy. I guess my biggest issue is I would love to just find a large project that uses ALL these things at once and doesn't involve me using cloud formation template. Almost like a giant ""final"" project that utilizes everything covered in the course. 

Do you have any idea on something like that, and maybe it give a guide if I get stuck? I feel the only way for me to learn this is by doing it like you are saying.

g3lnpew,ikht5g,"The difficulty was on a par, but the 15 of 65 most difficult questions on the exam were probably only matched by the toughest 30 of ~390 questions by John Bonso. But in terms of options for practice exams they are the best I could find. As I mention above, Tutorial Dojo are already getting outdated, two examples being:
- EBS is now also multi-instance, and not just EFS (although EFS is still the choice for large scale multi-instance), and
 - ""connection draining"" is an older term phasing out with ""Classic Load Balancers"", and it is now ""deregistration delay"" with the ALB

There were more inconsistencies, but if you have solid background and reference as many resources as you can, you will start identifying these, and doing your own research in the AWS documentation, which is a great way to learn. 
But again, the Tutorial Dojo exam sets are excellent in how they give you full detailed reviews of why the right answers are right and the wrong answers are wrong in most questions, including links to AWS documentation. For me after going through the six timed tests once, I was remembering questions if they appeared again so make the best use of the first go.
I got a link here on Reddit for 6 free older tests on Udemy, that were also great practice, but much easier facts and figure questions, so I assume they were SAA-C01 test sets.

I regretfully got the official AWS practice exam on the day of the test in fear that I was missing out on something, and the 20 questions were definitely representative of exam questions but a little poor with some grammar mistakes. I wouldn't recommend spending the money.

Hope it helps",3.0
g3nq6u7,ikht5g,"Congratulations! Thanks for sharing your feedback and for using our practice tests. We are always updating our content to ensure it is on par with the actual AWS exam. The connection draining and deregistration delay have the same concept but they are different features of CLB and ALB respectively.

By the way, take note that EBS is NOT entirely multi-instance per se since you can only attach a certain EBS type to multiple Nitro-based EC2 instances. You can only do that with PIOPS, not for gp2, sc1 and st1 types. This is the reason why we still choose EFS as the  POSIX-based storage service for multiple instances:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html

It‚Äôs also incorrect that CLB is already phased out and replaced with ALB and the official AWS documentation can prove that, as well as the AWS Console. 

For the Classic Load Balancer, it is still a valid service in AWS. I know that some folks here thinks that the CLB is obsolete, but it‚Äôs actually not and if you take the Advanced Networking Specialty, SA Pro and Specialty Security cert exams, the CLB is used for variety of scenario that ALB can‚Äôt.

On your comments, I did not say ""phased out"" nor ""obselete"" above, so nothing extra to add for now - my original comments still stand.

To put it in context for others, it was only on the day of the exam that I realised that it is ""deregistration delay"" for the recommended ALB - which means in the material I was using I had seen more references to ""connection draining"" for the CLB.

Adrian himself comments openly that his prior Linux Academy course is out of date, but it is out of his control to take it down, so the let the buyer beware. 

The pace at which AWS announce new products, and/or improvements and changes to existing products is ridiculously frequent, so you really need the latest material. And as of today, for SAA-C02, that is Adrian's course. For me, I also really happen to like his visualisation, demo code, depth and pace over others.
For the price, it is stupidly good value for money.

g3ldhoa,ikght0,"I went down the same path as you for the Associates where I used Stephane's courses. Great price point and he knows his stuff for sure. With the SA Pro, I was not 100% convinced that just slides alone were enough to help me pass the SA Pro. Having watched about 20% of both courses, I find that Adrian's course is very detailed and more of what I was looking for in terms of depth. 

Stephane's course is a great refresher on things, he does some additional deep dives and adds depth to certain areas he thinks you will need to know. 

In terms of length, Adrian's course is not done yet, but I'm already about 10 hours in (with following the demos) and I'm sure its another 30 or so hours if you do all the demos correctly. 

If you can afford it, I'd say use both. However, if price is a concern, the cost of not passing the SA Pro is going to higher then getting both sets of courses and passing. Especially for such a hard exam, I would rather be over prepared. 

Another way to think about this as well, if you don't remember something from the Associate course (like as API Gateway timeout from Developer, CloudWatch monitoring details from SysOps, etc etc), you will have to rewatch/find them again in Maarek's courses since he states he assumes you should know it. 

Lastly, I think its about experience and style. If you have some experience in AWS, I think Maarek's course should be enough. For someone like me (DBA by trade, but not too many interactions with other parts of AWS), I need the demos to show me what I am doing and how I am doing it. Otherwise its just theory. 

Either choice is solid.

After reading this subreddit for a few months now, you will notice that many people like the variety of choices they have because every teacher's style is different or presents something in different ways.

I do NOT teach to pass a cert ... i teach people to gain real world skills.. the cert at the end is a natural result of this.

You are doing the inverse, suggesting that if you have experience certs are useless and that is factually not true. The way the recruitment industry is globally ... prescreening happens all the time and certs are one of the only thing which matters at that stage of the process, together with the right to legally work.

and to be honest normally i advise my students against studying for CCP in isolation.

(full disclosure I create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io))

I created my SAA course to include the cloud practitioner material because I don't think seperate study is worth it. You learn all your need to pass the CCP by studying for the SAA (assuming a good course).

Many of the longer certified people on here, also never had the opportunity for the CCP, since we got our SAA's before the CCP was even a thing.

In my view, efficiency wise

1. get a good solid SAA Course (new release, SAA-C02 topics)
2. study for it
3. (optional) take the CCP exam, pass and get the 50% off voucher
4. sit the SAAC02 exam (optionally with the 50% off voucher)

Im consistently making the point that you don't need the baby step of the CCP, the issue is most SAA Courses make too many assumptions on starting knowledge.

Doing the CCP exam and then SAA wont cost you much more because of the 50% off voucher you get .. but cost efficacy wise.. you don't need CCP material and then SAA Material .. or you shouldn't :)

\## No Prerequisite

AWS no longer requires you to take certain exams to advance to more difficult exams.

\## Should you skip it?

Should you skip the Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-CO1)?  I  generally do not recommend it. CLF-C01 contains foundational knowledge, and some knowledge not found in any other exam. Specifically to Governance, Billing and other enterprise-wide services. The update to the Solutions Architect Associate from SAA-C01 and SAA-C02 remove overlapping knowledge so CLF-C01 in my opinion is its own thing.   Even someone who holds a Pro Certification would be surprised there is valuable knowledge in the CLF-C01.

\## But should you get the CCP certification?

If you have limited funds than I recommend that you study the CLF-C01 but not sit the exam. The CLF-C01 will carry knowledge into all your other certifications and your career into AWS.

The real reason to sit the CLF-C01 is to get used to the exam experience so you are not stressed when you take a more difficult exam or you do not fail due to unexpected technicality during your exam-taking process.

\## Free CCP

I have a free video course for the CLF-C01. You could watch the whole thing in a day or two and then move onto the Solutions Architect Associate.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE)

I also have a free SAA-C01 course. I have an updated SAA-C01 but honestly, all I did was add a few sections, The SAA-C02 will be released soon, just been busy publishing my free SOA-C01 course.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia-UEYYR44s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia-UEYYR44s)

The question asks for the situation where

1. The company must manage the encryption keys themselves
2. use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption.

There are 4 types of encryption

1. Client Side - you encrypt the object, and then upload to S3. You handle keys, and you handle encryption process. S3 is not involved in any way, it simply stores encrypted data. This is NOT correct because YOU encrypt and NOT S3.
2. SSE-C - you manage keys, provide key and object to S3 and it encrypts for you (SSE-C is server side encryption, client managed keys) this is what answer D is, the correct answer
3. SSE-S3 - S3 manages keys and encryption.. you supply object, its encrypted. This is NOT correct, because S3 handles keys NOT you.
4. SSE-KMS as above, but with extra features. This is NOT correct, because S3 handles keys NOT you.

D = SSE-C which is correct. D is NOT client side encryption, because that would mean both key management and encryption happens on the client side. D is SSE-C where keys are managed client side, but encryption happens server (s3) side.

A Cannot be correct because bucket default encryption only works with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS (S3 manages keys, and does encryption). SSE-C or Client Side Encryption are NOT supported with bucket default encryption.

g3io61f,ik0t8u,"If you only have time to do one, 100% do Jon's. I passed my Solutions Architect Associate exam last summer, and even though that was the C01 exam, Jon's exams were better than that of Neil's by a landslide. You have a much, much better Q&amp;A forum, more realistic questions, more in-depth analysis of each answer choice, etc. Taking more practice exams won't necessarily help you, because to fully get the use out of practice exams, you have to spend may more time reviewing the questions &amp; answers and reading/watching the provided learning resources than actually taking the exams. Thus, a lot of people don't have the time to do that and/or don't want to spend the time doing that for 12 practice exams. As you're getting Neil's for free, I advise you to thoroughly take and review Jon's exams, and then once you think you're prepared for the actual exam, take a few of Neil's exams to see where you are. If his C02 exams are anything like his C01 exams, there are multiple unreasonable and illogical questions, so be wary of that.",3.0
g3lfd2h,ik0t8u,"Hey its Andrew Brown  üëã

I create practice exam questions but I'm not here to recommend mine today lol.

**Jon Bono's Practice Exam Questions**

Jon Bono's practice exam questions are:

* not worded like the exams
* are much more difficult than the actual exam
* the crux to his question is a technical factoid instead of a conceptual reason.

So there is good and bad to Jon Bono's practice exam questions. His associate questions are designed to make you think and go digging for the answer.

The bad to this, it will increase your study time since you're spending time looking things up. Also, it will really mess with your confidence because your Jon Bonso final score does not correlate to the exam, so you'll end up overstudying.

I would say Jon Bono's is a good study companion for Pro Certifications but you're still going to need practice exams that similar to the exam.

**Neal Davis Practice Exam Questions**

Neal's practice exam questions are more similar to the actual exam, in terms of wording, the framing of the question and your final score after a practice exam set.  The only problem with being close to real exams is that most people will become over-confident if they study the same set of questions more than once. Neal gets around this by having lots of questions.

I would say to have faster study time and more confidence to go with Neal. Especially if you are studying at the associate level.

**Stephanne Marrak**

Stephanne's questions are good as well. I think he has two sets in his Udemy course which is all he can include. The only issue is that is you can be prone to be over-confident by practicing the same sets due to not enough sets.

**My Approach**

My practice exams are very similar to the exam,  and I have very specific learning technologies such as my mastery system, variation system and video explanation companion. All these systems sound cool, but I haven't had the time to actually fill out my practice exam questions. So until I do my sets are on par I'd say with Stephanne's

**My Recommendation**

If you want the shortest study time and greatest confidence passing, especially at the associate level I recommend **Neal Davis** practice exam questions.

Full disclosure I teach a course for this cert, and I‚Äôm an AWS ML Hero, so I have biases...

While it‚Äôs true that 50% of this exam is nothing to do with AWS, the other 50% is made up of AWS specific questions around SageMaker and other AI services. 

If you know ML inside out then you would have to have at least some intuition about AWS services at the very least to be able to pass. 

Having said that, AWS SageMaker has been designed to support a ML Engineer using relatively native and open tools. So to address your current concern about not knowing where to start, you should be able to largely continue to work as you have in other environments. 

From there you can explore the finer points of SageMaker such as the built in algorithms but with your background you may find yourself exiting SageMaker altogether and using raw AWS infrastructure to create highly bespoke solutions. 

This book came out yesterday (I think) and you might find it interesting: https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Amazon-SageMaker-developers-scientists/dp/180020891X/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sagemaker&amp;qid=1598910682&amp;sprefix=sagemaker&amp;sr=8-3

1. The AWS exams (starting at C02) require you to have AWS Org knowledge, cross account knowing, advanced IAM knowledge and that is all difficult to deliver in sandboxes which are often pretty tightly controlled.
2. They aren't free - although from a marketing perspective you think 'no AWS costs', all you are doing really is paying upfront for AWS time via the sandbox. You commit to a certain length, and you have 0 risks of cost blowouts - but you ALWAYS have that cost - using it or not.

As you can see from my profile, I work(ed) at Linux Academy (and now A Cloud Guru). After the acquisition, we evaluated the content catalog to determine the best material in order to end up with a unified, and consistent, catalog.

Part of that included determining which courses were the most current and where we have the staff to continue to update it. Ryan Kroonenburg's course met that standard. Ryan just completed updates a few weeks ago and, for Linux Academy fans, some of those updates were authored by Linux Academy alumni Mark Richman. Additionally, Mark is working on more than a dozen labs to add to that course which will increase the runtime somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 hours or so.

The great thing about the combination of Linux Academy and A Cloud Guru is the opportunity we have. Each organization took different approaches to content creation. Each organization was successful in doing so. When we brought those organizations together, our new 'third way' of content creation draws upon the strengths of each organization.

Want to get in and get right to cramming for the exam in question (as you say above) - we have content for that!

Need a deeper dive in a topic for study or for understanding the context of real-world application of that knowledge - we have the content for that!

Have a question about how to do something specific - check ou our 1400+ Hands-On Labs and get your hands dirty in PRACTICING that skill!

Going forward, you will see new content from ACG that follows the best content you came to expect from A Cloud Guru AND Linux Academy - and we still have the Training Architects from both ACG and LA around to be sure you will!",0.0
g3lunta,ijfhe3,"Mmmm what a very nice, rehearsed answer that didn't actually address any of the concerns in my post.

The new AWS-SAA course is a little over half of the length as the old one. Now I doubt that the topics that the certification exam covers dropped by 40%, so why did the prep course for that exam shrink by 40%?",4.0
g3mb7ft,ijfhe3,"Glad that sounded rehearsed, I made it up on the spot!

So no, the certification did not drop by 40%, but that does not mean that that 40% is necessary to pass the certification. Not everyone is willing or able to commit to a course that is almost 60 hours in length, so we try to be respectful of our student's time. The way things work as a result of the combination of our platforms is this:

* Certification course - designed to cover 100% of the exam objectives and prepare you to successfully sit for the exam. The labs provide hands-on practice of those concepts, in real-world scenarios so you also see how and when those skills you learn need to be applied (i.e. context).
* Deep Dives - some students appreciate deeper coverage of one or more topics (Cloud Formation Templates for example). In the certification course, CF Templates will be covered, but their coverage will be more limited in scope to the objectives for that domain in the exam. A separate Deep Dive on that topic concentrates on all the ins and outs of CF Templates

In this scenario, YOU are in charge of how you learn and where you spend your time. You can take a detour and explore the details of one subject (or multiple) but otherwise, you are learning what you need to in order to succeed at the exam if that is your primary goal.  The entire reason we are here at ACG is your success, so we try to provide different ways for different students to be successful.

The motto we have lived by since acquisition is 'better together'. I realize that may sound a bit corny but it really does represent that for our students, the combination of ACG and LA means a better experience for students from both platforms. We can now provide training and guidance that reaches more students and appeals to more learning styles.

Whatever you decide going forward, we appreciate your having been a student and wish you nothing but success on your learning journey!",2.0

You're grossly overestimating the amount of time you need. You can easily fit an amazing amount of stuff in a year. 

Even if you do get into paid area you're not going to leave services running 24/7 and nearly everything will be billing at pennies per hour only during the time you practice.

Given that Cloud Practitioner is $99 and the rest of the associates exams are $149 you will be spending way way more on the exams than you'd reasonably rack up in hands on.

If you do create an account, set up a budget that will simply freeze things once you cross $5-10. There's no ""gotcha"" involved.

Also, the exams themselves are not ""practical"", meaning you aren't tested on hands on work. They're multiple choice exams that are mostly theory and terminology.

g3dbqso,ijbs4u,"&gt; Obviously if you want to get good with AWS you have to train on it.

There's a difference between getting good at it and passing the exams. Someone able to learn for 100% by theory and reading, would be able to pass the exams without even creating an AWS account. This, knowing that the exams are multiple-choice questions about the topics. 

&gt; But I see you can possibly get billed for using AWS!

Of course! They're not a charity!

&gt; Does this make sense? How can you get good at something and practice with but fear of being billed?

Knowledge comes at a price. However, Free Tier should be sufficient to get hands-on experience and confirming the theory. Like 5GB of storage in S3 is covered by Free Tier. This is enough to demonstrate what S3 does and how it can be used. 

&gt; Does the free tier offer everything needed to pass an exam?

Maybe not 100%. Example: Free Tier will only cover one EC2 instance type, and one type of storage for it. However, even for CCP you should be able to tell the difference between instance types and the storage types. 

&gt; From what I understand the free tier is for 1 year. When it expires do I sign up with another email to continue practicing?

Partially correct. Some services are only in Free Tier during the first year after account creation (ie EC2, S3), some services have permanent Free Tier allowances (ie the first 25GB storage in DynamoDB, 62000 outbound e-mails with SES). Signing up with another email for the sake of getting Free Tier for longer might breach the T&amp;C. 

&gt; I‚Äôm nervous of starting to work with AWS, don‚Äôt want a hidden bill to come out of nowhere.

Set up Billing Alerts to get an e-mail or SMS when your estimated monthly bill reaches a certain threshold to minimize this risk. 

I think the most important thing to consider is that Free Tier, especially the first year's additional offers, is primarily meant for hands-on experience and a bit of experimenting. It should not be seen as a sandbox environment for educational purposes.",1.0

g3919uv,iiu9kr,"The private IP ranges listed are all the possible IPs that are considered private according to the specification RFC 1918. So for [10.0.0.0/8](https://10.0.0.0/8) , that is 16,777,216 IP addresses.

For VPC, they only allow a max of /16 so that means a total of  65536  IP address. So in the case of the  [10.0.0.0/8](https://10.0.0.0/8) range, you can only pick  65536  out of the total  16,777,216 ip addresses. Same thing applies for  [172.16.0.0/12](https://172.16.0.0/12). Max of 65536 out of  1,048,576. You can mix and match different ranges up to a max of  65536.

Edit: Max of /16 is per CIDR and you can have 5 CIDR per VPC. So it's 65536 x 5 =  327680 max ip per VPC",3.0
g392nla,iiu9kr,"Subnetting is what you seem to be confused on. The private IP range is the three you mentioned, a.k.a. RFC1918. So let's use 10.0.0.0/8 as an example.

Within 10.0.0.0/8, you can create 10.20.20.0/24, which uses 10.20.20.0 thru 10.20.20.255, which is within the range of the /8. Max in this case means the maximum amount of IPs, so if you do 10.20.0.0/16, that's the biggest pool vpc allows and takes 10.20.0.0 thru 10.20.255.255. In the case of 192.168, since private IP is defined outside of aws control as /16, you can't have anymore cidr block if you create cidr of 192.168.0.0/16 because you just used the entire /16 but for 10.0.0.0/8 space, you still got plenty more to use if you wish. So for the rest of 4 cidr, you can choose to grab them from the other two continuous block. 

On the other hand, /28 is for instance, 10.20.20.0/28, which has a range of 10.20.20.0 thru 10.20.20.15. That range is still within the range of 10.0.0.0/8. 

For instance, 8.8.8.8 for public Google dns is outside of all private range, 1.1.1.1 is outside, 11.0.0.0/25 is still outside, and 192.167.0.0/16 is also outside

Full disclosure i create courses for AWS at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) (i mention it because you will see links to my courses below in the links i paste, but i'm not trying to get you to buy)

I have a few links which will help

A student of mine wrote this [https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course](https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course)

I created this [https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html](https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html)

they cover the main topics and areas to focus on

I would also suggest joining [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) which has study groups and architecture channels etc

It's doable ... but it depends on your objectives, make sure you know if you are studying to learn or studying to pass the exam. I recommend the former, but many people do the latter .. which long term is worth less.

g37kqrk,iijvxo,"The A Cloud Guru course might not be enough if you do not have hands on experience with AWS. I suggest you to purchase Jon Bonso's mock tests on Udemy or his website (Tutorials Dojo) and appear in a couple of them to gauge your preparation. After the test, go through the explanation for all the questions to understand why the answer you chose is right or wrong. You can identify your weak areas from the test results and then dive deep on the individual topics. I passed SAA-C02 last week and felt quite challenged by the exam. The syllabus for SAA-C02 is a big bowl of spaghetti and so is the AWS question bank. I got very few questions on VPC but my colleague got lot of questions on same topic. Some people may get more questions on vpc while some may more on migration services like DataSync. My point is - Do not just concentrate on core topics (EC2/VPC/S3) but all topics equally and thouroughly. I personally did not find the A Cloud Guru course to be enough, so I purchased Stephane Maarek's Udemy course and I felt this course alongwith Jon Bonso's mock tests were the key to me passing the exams.

g36nawp,iigbth,"1. Starting with either Cloud Practioner or Solutions Architect Associate might be best starts. Stephane Maarek and Adrian Cantrill have great courses for SAA-C02. Pair either one with Jon Bonso's practice tests, you should be good to go along with practicing.

2. The free tier offers most of what you need for courses within their free tier. Make sure you setup billing alerts, stop/terminate any unnecessary resources and be careful when choosing specific things (instance type, database, etc). They do a good job of showing you what falls within free tier when you go to create resources.
3. Im not sure about requirements, but you can study the courses and definitely pass. In my opinion, you should understand why and what to use for specific objectives. Also, research other topics that can only help with understanding, which is: networking, security and so on. I think it's important to understand more then whats on the exam.

I did the other two associate certs after I started as an AWS SA, though. They were non-events; I did both of them inside of 4 weeks. I feel that people make too much of the SysOps Associate exam, it shouldn't be difficult for anyone who has prepared and has industry experience.

You don't have to pass, but at least going over the architect associate learning material would be a good idea before starting to prepare for developer associate.

g36lbzi,iiacdk,"I have no experience with the developer associate exam, but I did take the Solutions Architect associate exam last summer and passed it. I'm currently studying for the SAP exam, so I hope the info I'm gonna give you can somewhat help you lol

Biggest tip anyone can give you now - reschedule the exam if you're not feeling confident and/or need more time to polish up on some topics. I had to reschedule my SAA exam last year twice because I felt I needed more time. 

Moreover, if you're failing practice exams and it's the first time you're taking them, it's completely fine! Many people don't pass their practice exams the first time around (just like me), so don't beat yourself up over it. If it's not your first time taking the exams, and you're failing them/getting low passing scores, you should definitely reschedule your exam...you should also reschedule your exam if you've only taken your practice exams one time through, as you don't have enough time (2 days is 110% not enough time) to review your weak topics and get all of the practice exams done twice. Taking the exams twice is extremely important as you get an overview of what you still need to review. 

I don't know what you need to know for services in relation to the dev associate exam, but here is a brief overview of the services you mentioned above (excluding ""EC2 specifics"", as that's quite broad and what you need to know varies from exam to exam)

Elastic Beanstalk - used to quickly turn your code into AWS infrastructure (IaaS). Suited more for those who have no experience in AWS and simply want to get their app running as quickly as possible on AWS. Compared to CloudFormation, with Elastic Beanstalk, you're trading a lot of the flexibility with your resources in return for greater simplicity/less admin overhead. OpsWorks (idk if you need to know about this service) is a balance between the flexility of CloudFormation and the simplicity of EB. 

API Gateway - at it's basic form, it's a door/gateway to your AWS resources. Read more about it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).

X-ray - solution to debug your app. Can trace and analyze user requests. Read more about it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/)

You get a red ring around your face if the software thinks you‚Äôre looking away from your screen. If your ring is red for longer than 10 seconds then the exam is automatically terminated. 

I set my Logitech webcam on a tripod to the right of my Macbooks screen and the software thought me looking at my screen was me looking AWAY from the screen. So I had to awkwardly turn my head towards the camera and look at the screen out of the corner of my eyes. I asked the proctor if I could adjust my camera but received no response. 

I found myself more worried about looking at the camera and avoiding the red ring of death versus focusing on the exam/questions. 

Other than that, everything went extremely smooth.....",1.0
g32afi2,ihs55n,"Thanks for your feedback. I'm planning of using my MacBook for the exam so the camera is in front of me.

Now I have to wonder to choose the screen of death or to wait for a customer service rep from Vue by telephone or chat.

I think that Vue need to change the rule to allow to book the exam online if you choose the ELS +30. We are in 2020!!!",1.0

g2zn62l,ihcqaq,"Hello!  Disclaimer I teach courses on this cert, I am biased... But I'm also an AWS ML Hero and have my honour to uphold! :D

SO... This cert is a little different from other AWS certs in that 50% of the questions are general ML/DL, with the other 50% a mixture of AWS specific ML services.

AWS does not have any restrictions on who can take this exam, so you could take it now, however, I always recommend that students have at least an associate-level cert under their belt first.

The reason for that is that AWS Cert exams are not easy, and having an idea of what to expect before heading into a Pro/Specialty level exam is a good idea.  Also there is a level of AWS knowledge that is required as a base under all that AI/ML/DL stuff. 

My course, which is available in early access, reflects that and is designed for students who have SAA-C0\[X\] certification.  However, there are some students who are looking to study both at the same time.    (And seeing as most of them are taking [u/acantril](https://www.reddit.com/u/acantril/) 's AWS SAA-C02 course I can understand that they might need a break from him to listen to me every now and then &lt;- lol joke :p)

I have been teaching for this cert since it came out, and AWS recently made me an AWS ML Hero as a result, so I have some insight here. 

Specifically in your case, having the SAA-C0X is a great place to start MLS-C01 study.

The ML Specialty is a little different from other AWS exams, as it focuses far more on the pure concepts of AI/ML and DL.  That is to say that 50% of the questions are NOT AWS specific.  Then 25% are about SageMaker, and another 25% are on other services including AWS AI services.  

I am currently creating a premium course that goes in-depth into ML/DL and AWS AI/ML/DL specifically for passing this cert.   It's in early access now, which means that while I complete the course, we have a vibrant group of early access students working through the content and making sure they get what they need out of me, whilst also helping each other.   There is a range of students there from complete ML noobs to experts who have already passed the exam.  Everyone rocks.

g2v7055,igpcus,"I find this a hard one because i do value a lot of the experience of going to college and/or university.. but one of the things which the COVID pandemic is highlighting is the questionable value of physical in-person training.

Many of the original training providers were created because of the lack of value for 'in-person' AWS training ... several thousand $ for a week long course which covered 25% of what you needed. or a $40 course which covers it all and you can do it at your own pace.

The same critical analysis of many universities is happening now .. because people are still learning, remote, at their own pace and not getting into huge debt.

The thing is, there are elements of IT knowledge which are timeless ... logic, hardware, architecture, algorithms and various systems design methodologies. Everything else changes so often that i question the value of long university courses like this - and this is excluding the cost that is associated with it.

Looking at the topics covered .. i can see anyone who is dedicated covering the same stuff in less than 2 years, while holding down a job ... earning money at the time time as getting the same knowledge and potentially gaining more appropriate skills.

There is a lot of unrelated stuff grouped together in that 2 year course

VMware Certified Professional (VCP)

Azure Administration

Cloud Automation/DevOps (100% this is outdated by the time you take it)

Advanced Scripting for Cloud (there is no 'cloud scripting' ... its scripting )

I think its a big choice you have to make, but consider a few things

1. The cost
2. The time you use ... 2 years vs ....
3. Can you hold a job at the same time to avoid student debt (avoiding this means you could FIRE - financial independence retire early)
4. The relevance of the skills you gain

If i were anyone looking at this ... knowing what i know of the industry and seeing the changes occurring .. i would seriously consider creating my own 2 year long program of training using quality online sources &amp; working while i was doing it.

I went the traditional route.. degree, then work experience, then IT certification, by any objective measure im doing ok for myself. If i had to do it over again, i would 100% skip university (for IT careers). Save the time, the debt, the learning of outdated topics. I'd get a part time job (minimal time to support myself) and create myself a study plan which would be much more effective than than any university course.

A university degree shouldn't be seen as a default or a standard. It should be considered based on ROI. For some careers its needed, for some, you can do better without the debt/time shackles.

But, when I was looking for my next step after having some AWS experience under my belt, most of the consulting and SA roles involved migrations where having some experience and knowledge about on prem architectures were needed and the fundamentals beyond AWS.  

I am *still* weak with respect to knowing anything about networking or Devops outside of AWS specific technologies. I have never had to administer a server - Linux or Windows. By the time I was at a point in my career where Inwas responsible for infrastructure, we were spinning up managed servers and all of my ‚ÄúLinux development‚Äù was deploying to Lambda and Fargate. 

But that‚Äôs not the real world. Most of the world is still running on VMs - even on AWS. How many other companies can hire someone who specializes in serverless architecture?  That being said, somewhere down on my list is learning Linux better. 

VMWare is still so big in the enterprise, AWS is even offering VMWare hosting.

Someone just coming into the IT field should have a wide understanding of technology. For instance while the tools change. The fundamentals of Devops has been the same for twenty years. Windows and Linux administration isn‚Äôt going to change that much in two years.

Colleges cannot teach AWS material without being an AWS academy, and therefore, must use official AWS prep courses.

Look at it in the abstract.

There is a pool of knowledge required to pass the SA Pro exam (if you want to pass it the right way).

There is a subset of that which will let you pass the SA associate exam

If you can really pass the PRO, you can pass the associate as well

Passing the $150 associate .. gives you a 50% off voucher on the $300 PRO (so a 2-for-1)

Normally the route for most people is all 3 associates followed by SA Pro.

I've created my courses ([https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io)) to allow associate SA -&gt; Pro SA .. and im not aware of anyone else doing this (I could be wrong). I cover a lot of stuff in the associate level which the pro level course requires and most pro courses are the same.

Its a tough one, in 99% of cases I'd say SA Associate then SA Pro if you want to be efficient, but it is possible you are that 1% - only you can answer that one.

g2vqa7c,iglfop,"Hello u/muk80

What makes our [AWS Cloud Practitioner Practice Exam](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams/) popular to CCP takers is because of its effectiveness. We make sure that it always contains the relevant and updated information based on the feedback of students on what appeared on the actual exam, as well as through external benchmarking.

Aside from that, our practice exams come with different exam modes to help you prepare and review better for the real exam. For example, we have a Section-based mode where you can focus and answer questions on specific topics only. This is a helpful way to pinpoint your areas of weakness.

You can also check our [ebook](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/tutorials-dojo-study-guide-and-cheat-sheets-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/) for the Cloud Practitioner Exam.

g2ter4m,igf6up,"Start with the SA Assoc. and then go to the SA Pro (alternatively, you could also get the other 2 Assoc. certs then go for the SA Pro).  See how you do on the SA Assoc. exam and then decide your next step.  If the SA Assoc. exam is a cake walk then you can go direct to the Pro.  If it is hard for you then go for Dev and SysOps next on your way to the SA Pro. All of these build on each other. I have passed all 3 associate exams and am now studying SA Pro.  From what I hear, the Pro and Specialty exams are significantly more challenging.

Either way. Check out Adrian Cantrill's AWS courses here:

Just get the bundle with both SA Assoc. and SA Pro. 

Adrian's courses are terrific!",5.0
g2til4t,igf6up,"Also, you should be expect to have at least 2 phases to your study for each exam:

1. Complete the course doing the hands-on in each section while hopefully taking notes to help you retain what you're studying.
2. After you finish the content, do as many practice exams as you can.  However, note that the point of the practice exams is not the memorize answers.  Instead, what you want to do is understand why the answer for each question is the best answer.  John Bonso's exams, which you can get here:

g2qq5tf,ifz3bl,"Hi /u/MrPositive1

I can't comment for myself since it was so long ago... (full disclosure I create courses for AWS at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) \- focused on learning AWS &amp; Jobs &amp; cert, not just passing a cert)

the average for my students on all my courses is 6-8 weeks - regardless of the actual cert

This assumes a few things

1. Learning the tech... not just cramming for an exam
2. 1-2 hours of focused study per day
3. Good study technique focused on understanding not just remembering
4. Average skill level

You can obviously adjust the 6-8 weeks based on adjustment of any of the above 4 factors.

Interestingly enough, this doesn't change based on the level of the certification. While they do get harder, generally students also increase in skill level to offset the increase in difficulty.

If you are interested ... join [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) \- there are study groups and architecture channels which will give you an advantage even just via background absorption.

Just don't rush it .. if anyone tells you they got it with \~2 weeks study. Then one of a few things are true .. 1) they are skilled already 2) they crammed/dumped it 3) their methods mean any knowledge gained is lost days after the exam. Take you time, think of it as building the foundations of future things. No matter how hard you think the associate SA is ... its the foundation to much more.

Resources: Pluralsight and practice tests from Jon Bonso",3.0
g2rdzez,ifz3bl,"depends if you study regularly and can spend atleast 4-5 hrs a day then you should be probably ready with the required knowledge in a month

then comes doing practice tests which might take 2 more weeks so overall 6 weeks prep time if done honestly everyday

2 weeks more to revise and read through the faqs, other items that you have to consider as well

Fairly 6-8 weeks is the usual overall timeframe

Follow stephane maarek course on udemy (also one of the highly recommended courses that covers SAA C02 totally), adrian cantrill's course on learn.cantrill.io(the best and thorough knowledge of AWS go for this if you want to really deep dive) and neal davis on udemy(also a very nice extended course with precise details)

For practice tests go for jon bonso and stephane maerek practice tests on udemy they both are good (score somewhere between 85%-90% might need multiple attempts to reach that score)

With all this completely done you can happily book the exam without any hesitation

g2qnp3z,ifym9a,"Lambda

* Its a serverless compute service where you upload your code and create a lambda function.
* AWS lambda takes care of provisioning and managing servers to run code.
* No need to worry about OS, patching, scaling etc. Serverless.
* Use lambda in the following ways:
    * Event driven compute service such as change to data in S3 bucket or dynamoDB table.
    * Run code in response to HTTP requests using API Gateway or SDK API calls.
    * Use to build a stateless application that can scale horizontally.
* Lambda functions scale out. If n events, n lambda functions. One function will never respond to multiple requests (lambda functions are independent : 1 event = 1 function).
* Lambda function can trigger other functions.
* Lambda duration is a maximum 15 minutes or 900 seconds.
* Components:
    * Function
        * Script or program that runs in Lambda. 
        * Lambda passes invocation events to your function. 
        * The function processes an event and returns a response. 
        * Lambda stores code in S3 and encrypts it at rest.
        * To create a function, first package your code and dependencies in a deployment package. Then upload package.
        * Once function is in production, Lambda automatically monitors functions on your behalf and reports metrics through CloudWatch.
        * Basic function settings include description, role, runtime.
    * Runtimes
        * This allows functions in different languages to run in the same base execution environment. 
        * Runtime sits in between lambda and function code, relaying invocation events, context information and responses between the two.
    * Layers
        * Distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes and other function dependencies.
        * Lets you manage your in development function code independently from the unchanging code and resources it uses.
        * Use layers to manage function‚Äôs dependencies independently and keep deployment package small.
    * Event source
        * AWS service or custom service that triggers your function and executes its logic. 
    * Downstream resources
        * AWS service that your Lambda function calls once triggered.
    * Log streams
        * While Lambda automatically monitors your function invocations and reports metrics to CloudWatch, you can annotate your function code with custom logging statements that allow you to analyze execution flow and performance of your Lambda function.
    * AWS SAM
* Environmental variables:
    * Key Value Pairs that create or modify as part of function config.
    * Dynamically pass settings to function code or libraries without making changes to code.
    * Environment variables are always encrypted at rest, and can be encrypted in transit as well.
* To prevent lambda functions from running continuously, there is a timeout. When timeout is reached, lambda function is terminated. Default is 3 seconds and max 900 seconds.
* Memory allocation is 128mb to 3008mb (in 64mb increments). If max memory is used further function invocation is terminated.
* Increase memory allocation of function to increase CPU available.
* Libraries need not be installed prior to function execution and can be executed during runtime.
* It is continuously scaling.
* ‚ÄòSimple Microservices Permissions‚Äô allows Lambda the execution role when building role/policy.
* Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to save connection strings when connecting Lambda to Databases.
* Event source mapping maps an event source (Kinesis, SQS, DynamoDB) to a Lambda function. It enables automatic invocation of function when event occurs.
* Best Practices:
    * Separate Lambda handler from core logic.
    * Take advantage of Execution Context reuse to improve function performance.
    * Use Environment Variables to pass operational parameters to function.
    * Control dependencies in function‚Äôs deployment package.
    * Minimize deployment package size to its runtime necessities. 
    * Reduce time it takes Lambda to unpack deployment packages.
    * Minimize complexity of dependencies.
    * Avoid using recursive code.
* Lambda supports sync and async invocation. You control using the following:
    * Sync : ‚Äòinvoke‚Äô RequestResponse (default)
    * Async : ‚ÄòEvent
    * Validation : DryRun
* Asynchronous Invocation
    * Asynchronous events are queued before being used to invoke Lambda function.
    * If Lambda is unable to process an event, it will automatically retry twice, with delays between retries.
    * If a Dead Letter Queue is specified, failed event is sent to SQS queue or SNS topic.
    * If no Dead Letter Queue specified, (which is not required and is default setting), event is discarded.
    * Configure the application to asynchronously process the requests and change invocation type of Lambda function to Event to prevent app from being unresponsive.
* Supports following languages - 
    * Node.js
    * Java
    * C#
    * Go
    * Python
* Poll based services used
    * SQS
    * DynamoDB
    * Kinesis Streams
* AWS Lambda@Edge CloudFront triggers:
    * Lets you run functions to customize content that CloudFront delivers, executing functions in AWS locations closer to viewer.
    * Viewer Request
    * Viewer Response
    * Origin Request
    * Origin Response
* Lambda policies to write to CloudWatch
    * logs:CreateLogGroup
    * logs:GetLogEvents
    * logs:PutLogEvents
* Lambda Triggers
    * Synchronously
        * ELB (ALB)
        * Cognito
        * Lex
        * Alexa
        * API Gateway
        * CloudFront
        * Kinesis Data Firehose
    * Asynchronously
        * S3
        * SNS
        * SES
        * CloudFormation
        * CloudWatch logs/events
        * CodeCommit
        * Config
* Versioning
    * Publish multiple versions of Lambda functions for development workflow.
    * Each function has a unique ARN.
    * After published, version cannot be changed.
    * $Latest is newest version and can be edited. (Qualified ARN has this at end).
    * Split traffic using versions (cannot use $Latest).
    * To avoid new version instability, and minimize impact, use ‚Äòrouting-config‚Äô parameter in alias to define percentage of incoming traffic to each version. 
    * For routing config percentage - use in decimals (5% = 0.05)
* Alias
    * Alias is a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. Remember to update ARN to use new code.
    * Alias cannot point to another alias.
    * Alias can be pointed to max 2 versions, assuming:
        * Both versions have same IAM role.
        * Both versions have same Lambda function dead letter queues or no DLQ config.
        * Both versions must be published.
        * Cannot point to $LATEST.
* Lambda Pricing
    * Number of requests
        * First 1m free. $0.20 per 1m requests after.
    * Duration
        * Time code begins executing until it terminates. $0.00001667 per GB-second used.
* Concurrent Execution Limit
    * Safety feature to limit the number of concurrent executions across all functions in a given region per account.
    * If you have too many Lambda functions running in the same region and you suddenly start seeing new invocation requests being rejected, you may hit your limit.
    * Reserved concurrency guarantees that a set number of executions which will always be available for your critical function, however this also acts as a limit.
    * Default 1000
    * 100 allocated towards unreserved concurrency pool.
    * TooManyRequestsException / HTTP status code 429
    * Request throughout limit exceeded through AWS support center.
    * Calculate : (invocations per second) * (average execution duration in seconds)
* Lambda and VPCs
    * When you require Lambda function to access resource in private VPC with no Internet access.
    * Allow function to connect to private subnet.Must have a NAT gateway since Lambda loses Internet access when you enable a VPC.
    * Lambda will need following VPC config info:

g2p1xb0,ifimad,"Hey man!  This has been a general feeling for me the last little while. I've got 2 young kids at home, so general lack of sleep and constant change of focus is a thing.  I'm also getting on in age (will be 50 in a few weeks), the idea that it's 'normal' for memory to not perform as well as we get older is there.  I've had the feeling that I just can't remember anything clearly...

I started studying for that exam a few weeks ago, and I'm about 30% thru Adrian's course.  And I quickly realized that this is a lot of information to process and if I'm to retain enough of it to be of use, I need to change the way I learn.  So with that in mind, I started looking into how people who have a ""super"" memory do it.  Turns out, it's a skill that can be learned, that memory is a lot more like a muscle that can be exercised, and that there are a variety of methods and tricks to help with retention of information.  A gross over-simplification, it involves tying new information to existing information in your head.  For example, using a well known room or object, and 'attaching' new ideas to existing ones.  The more creatively you do this, the more chance it has of sticking.

I have by no means integrated any of this stuff yet, and I haven't quite figured out how to structure everything yet, although the I'm playing around with the idea of a container transport ship.  If I have any success with this, (ie pass the exam) I will post.

The book I listened to (audible) is Kevin Horsley's Unlimited Memory.  It's pretty short so doesn't require a huge time commitment.

With the practice tests you are doing, don't just 'do them' for all the questions you fail you need to record the question, the right and wrong answers and challenge yourself to prove why you were wrong, and why the right answers were right. Review the question, what scenario elements or keywords should you have spotted to pick the correct answer.

Unlike most vendors Ive designed by architect path to be doable without the other associates.

SO instead of Architect associate, dev associate, sysops associate and then SA Pro... my courses enable SA Associate -&gt; SA Pro in an efficient path.

My SA Associate also allows people to skip the cloud practitioner .. as it starts at beginner level.

Anyway, as others have said, its doable ... infact you have plenty of time. My student average across all levels is 6 weeks given 1-2 hours a day. That goes for associate and pro, because your skill levels increase along with the exam.

Students have fed back that my C02 covers 60-70% of the dev and sysops associate so im going to create those courses split between \[C02/Common\] lessons and the dev/sysops specifics, it means people can use them as bridge courses really easily.

g2juh0h,iew8i8,"/u/neeaws A public VIF doesn't connect into a VGW (internally)

A public VIF provides access to AWS public space services/IP ranges ... SNS/SQS/S3 etc

When you create a VGW and VPN connection, you are allocated a pair of external IP addresses (in the AWS public space networks) which you normally connect to over the internet.

You can connect to these over a public VIF .. meaning your on-premises router can initiate an IPSEC tunnel between it and the public addresses the VGW has, over the public VIF .. in effect its the same architecture as using the internet, only you use the DX as transit to the AWS public space network

So its

On-premrouter -&gt; publicVIF -&gt; AWS Public zone IPs -&gt; VGW

rather than

On-premrouter -&gt; internet -&gt; AWS Public Zone IPs -&gt; VGW

That means you could have private VIFS to a VPC and public VIF + IPSEC tunnel to the VGW attached to the VPC..

You probably wouldn't want too though. The whole point of public VIF + IPSEC is to get the benefits of direct connect in terms of performance, and the security/encryption provided by IPSEC. If you use a private VIF and PublicVIF + Ipsec.. all the privateVIF gives you is a less secure version.",6.0

You get to go into a situation ... either stuff is on fire, stuff is performing badly, or a customer thinks they want/need or actually want/needs something and you have to translate that into technical designs. You get to play with all the bleeding edge tech and propose designs for clients.

Whats more..the skills needed suit someone with some skills, pushing back, working out needs vs wants ... cutting through the organisational BS ... it's amazing fun.

DynamoDB is for OLTP workloads, while Redshift is for OLAP. If there was a better answer for the exact question then he could still be right - while DDB + OLTP is usually correct, it‚Äôs all situational",2.0
g29u6l6,idh8k2,My understanding is that DynamoDB in the past did not support OLTP but just recently it does does support OLTP. It could just be that the practice exam question needs to be updated.... Shout out to Bonso for the excellent Practice exams by the way.,2.0

g29smqb,idh8k2,"Yes thanks! It‚Äôs question 30 on practice test 5 for the AWS Cert. SAA. 

A company is migrating a DB to AWS. The DB has over 50TB of consumer data, handles highly transactional (OLTP) workloads, and is expected to grow. The SA should ensure that the DB is ACID compliant and can handle complex queries.

Amazon DynamoDB was marked incorrect. The correct answer is supposedly Amazon Aurora.",1.0
g29yo1l,idh8k2,"Hey bro, so for this one, it has these 3 requirements:

- handles OLTP workload
- ACID compliant
- support complex queries

NoSQL and RDBMS databases can handle OLTP workloads but the latter provides optimal performance than the former. Please see the reference link below that explicitly mentioned that RDBMS is more suitable for OLTP. 

https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/

Second, DynamoDB is not natively ACID-compliant. You have to use DynamoDB Transactions to make it suitable for OLTP. Yet still, it may not be enough depending on the type of transactions or system you‚Äôre building.

Third, complex queries means having JOINS, UNION and other SQL queries that relates 2 or more tables. Since DynamoDB is schemaless, it is not capable of having table relationships, like having a foreign key etc.

More information can be found in the explanation part of our practice tests.

I understand that technically, DynamoDB can handle OLTP workload, provided that it uses the DynamoDB Transactions API. But in this case, the option didn‚Äôt mentioned anything about it. And again, DynamoDB is not natively ACID-compliant and incapable of having complex queries where you have table relationships.",7.0

AWS is more about the ways &amp; parts that make the machine, while programming is telling the machine what to do..  close but different. Both are good, but you need to put an investment in one, now.

For programming you don‚Äôt need cloud, all you need is a laptop. For working AWS, you need internet and account as well.

Yes, you can start building code into AWS infra and learn that along the way, but decide from what direction are you approaching your learning :

Programmer who utilizes AWS tools, or AWS ‚Äúguy‚Äù who knows some programming.. those are different approaches.

If programming, the language is important but not as important in learning the right way to code these days, how to organize code, design, document it and more.. writing a good code goes miles beyond the programming language",2.0

g29uz7e,id9ycu,"u/WaitAtMilano

yeah I read that and I also read somewhere else that if your queue is FIFO then make your DLQ also a FIFO.

What's confusing is that if according to the AWS documentation we do not use DLQ, but even if a single message fails and goes back to the original FIFO queue( not DLQ) , what happens to the rest of the messages that are being consumed by the consumer? How is the ordering maintained in that case?",1.0
g284mlf,id9ycu,"I think the issue here is the concept of 'transaction' and separating different message of a single transaction , and hoping that the GroupId will allow you to still group and handle rest of the messages like a transaction will.

If 5 messages actually belong to a single conceptual unit , which should be treated as a transaction, then it should be a single message,not 5.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit : I wonder, if step functions could help you to manage transnational aspect of what you are trying to accomplish, if number of messages in a transaction is fixed , then you can combine all messages to one, and handle that in a state machine,if one of the step  fails, you can handle that in your state machine.

but in that can what's the point of even having a FIFO in sqs ? I can just have 1 message and use a standard queue. 

I was under the impression that FIFO gaurantees order as long as you messages have the same groupId.

So consider this scenario:

5 messages - all have same groupId

1 consumer consumes all these 5 messages. Now while processing it, for some reason message 2 failed to be processed so it's visibility Timeout expires and it goes back to the queue, now what happens to the rest of the messages that the consumer is consuming ? how is the ordering handled in this case ?

g2663om,id00iy,"hi /u/nottyheadedboss

so... full disclosure i create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) and founded a learning community at [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) (mentioning both below, which is why i mention it).

I want to start by advising against looking at the cloud practitioner study as its own isolated thing. I've taught 100,000's of students and one common thing is that there is a ton of overlap between the CloudPractitioner (CCP) and SA Associate (SAA)

If you study for CCP, and then study for SAA ... you are going to be double studying a shared amount of stuff, and it's inefficient.

I created my first course for the new version of the SA Associate exam ( [https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02) ) with the intention that it be welcoming for beginners ... helping to avoid the double investment of CCP and SAA Courses .. which makes no sense to me.

My usual suggestion ... is

1. Study for SAA...
2. Sit the CCP exam (the content required is a subset of SAA) - this is a practise run :)
3. Pass and get 50% off voucher
4. use that to sit SAA ... 50% off
5. Pass ...

That way, one course, 2 exams for very little extra cost vs one exam.

For me there are a few really important things for learning AWS.

1. Use structured training - i know i have a bias (disclosed at the top) but before i trained people I got all the AWS certs - and you cant do better than structured training ... people have made the mistakes for you - what you get is efficiency
2. As part of the above, create AWS accounts and start practicing. My course above gets you to make 3 AWS accounts, uses the free tier and you work through theory, and practical lessons in there. Very little if any expense, and you gain real world practical experience.
3. Join a learning community such as [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) .. it has general community discussions, community projects, study groups and jobs channels. By immersing yourself in this ... you will learn a lot.
4. My above course has a load of practical demos in... based on real world stuff you would do as a solutions architect. When you get beyond those I make these available to the community for free [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) these are AdvancedDemos which will get you to implement actual mini projects (i really recommend these for later on).

I might get some downvotes for the above, but beyond me making courses i spend hours a day trying to help new people in the space get started. I love helping newcomers and career shift people so even if you don't take my advice above .. please do join the slack team above.. and i'll help you however i can.

Good luck.

\## Should you skip the Certified Cloud Practitioner and go straight to Solutions Architect Associate?

I recommend not skipping the Certified Cloud Practitioner because it contains information not found in other certifications. Even AWS Professional Certification holders have sat the CCP and have been surprised they never knew about services like AWS Artifact or Inspector or a variety of others. 

You will not gain foundational knowledge in Associate level certifications because it will be assumed you have that knowledge.

You study path will be slower because knowledge gain will not scale with the difficulty of the exams.  if you proceed directly to Solutions Architect Associate, you'll end up over-studying increasing your chance of failure and then just going back to the CCP.

Another factor is experiencing sitting the exam. The first time sitting the exam is very stressful because of what can go wrong during the test-taking process. Reduce your risk by gaining confidence and understanding of the test-taking process on the easier certification.  

\## Can you study for the Solutions Architect Associate and the pass the Certified Cloud Practitioner?

Maybe, leaning towards no. The update from the SAA-C01 to the SAA-C02 has dropped a domain (section) on the exam and pushed that knowledge into the CCP. 

The passing grade for the CCP is 70% so you have large margin of error, but I still don't see any reason for you to gamble your efforts, When it's just faster and more reliable to study the CCP first and the move to SAA",4.0

there is no fixed timeframe. People will make comments as though they guess, but ive seen things feature VERY soon after release. I know for a fact that SAA-C02 has started to have new questions arrive that im 99% sure wern't on it a few weeks back.. even though no formal change has happened. My C02 course has had 6 updates since release to cope with that.

Generally smaller iterative changes are made all the time with major point 1.1/2/3 made less often and a C01 -&gt; C02 style update less often too.

It also seems over time the higher levels receive less updates then the lower ones, but when the higher ones are updated its super extensive. Like when the DEVOPS pro was changed to be 50% code\* ... what was a fun one.

It used to be that course creators like myself could relax a bit (hah) but now i get into the habit of updating stuff as soon as i can.

Networking skills are valued, i'd dare say essential to work in any meaningful way with cloud.

If you already have a comp sci degree, you probably already have the basics in most areas of IT so i would suggest to just start building on that.

If you want to work in the networking space then there are a few worthwhile things

1) AWS certified Solutions Architect Associate (foundation to AWS ... don't waste your time on the cloud practitioner study)

2) CCNA/CCNP

3) AWS SA Pro

4) AWS Certified Advanced Networking Specialty.

At that point (assuming you study to learn, rather than study to pass the exam only) you will have a good solid understanding of networking in AWS, networking in general and solutions architecture.

g1t628p,ib6eku,"/u/cool_shal2020 I suspect this might get voted down as its a bit of self promotion :) but ... i want to try and save people some $$

My AWS Solutions Architect Associate course ( [https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02) ) covers all of the topics you need for both the CCP and the SA Associate SAA-C02. Its in one course, suitable for beginners to AWS and means you get one set of material which is enough to cover both sets of exams.

One think I will say, its not the right material if you just want to quickly pass an exam .. the course is comprehensive, full of demos and aims to teach you AWS from beginner to associate architecture level.

Search the subreddit a bit for reviews ... but its been really successful so far.

I have a growing list of students with no prior experience who've used it to learn AWS, passes certs and got jobs. A lot of students doing career switches into IT/Cloud and this together with [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) is a killer resource pair IMO.

Anyway, thats it, just wanted to try and help save the whole .. 1 course for CCP and 1 course for SAA thing, when its really not needed.

‚ÄúI have a higher IQ than everyone because I only use the free material and don‚Äôt have to pay anyone for my training needs!‚Äù


There is a LOT of complete garbage free material out there.   There are some relatively inexpensive paid content that is highly recommended and easy to find.  

So yeah,  great,   You can easily spend 100hrs going thru all sorts of free material ranging in quality from complete crap,  to wonderfully insightful and useful...  but you are spending a lot of your time searching for it online and don‚Äôt have any real way to know if you are in the rubbish bin or finding the rare gem before you spend the time actually watching the material.      You also risk absorbing a lot of bad information in the process and having to unlearn stuff from one item to the next.  

Or you can spend 40-100hrs in high quality inexpensive paid content that is highly rated,  high efficient in its presentation,  and easy to absorb.  

You would think someone with an actual high IQ would realize it‚Äôs actually a pretty smart idea to be as efficient as possible,  especially when your time is literally money.    $40 paid course that will take you half the time as the search and digestion of a variety of ‚Äúfree‚Äù content.",3.0

g1t17a1,ib5t00,"/u/haimanon1 I suspect the problem is that you are trying to learn via remembering.

You have a limited short term memory and your long term is only used if you really 'learn' the tech and for many people this means via repetition or by doing.

You're already using Stephans course so this isnt an attempt to sell you anything   but in my course ([https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io)) i use a technique called layering where i introduce something, and then teach something else which requires the thing before (which requires you to use that knowledge and thus locks in in long term memory).

Over time the more and more layers added.. the more firmly the previous layers are retained without attempting to 'actually remember'.

An example is that in my course i have a long running demo theme

1. Wordpress on EC2 with DB
2. Move DB to another EC2
3. Migrate to RDS
4. Migrate to Aurora
5. MIgrate to aurora serverless
6. Learn EFS
7. Use EFS
8. MIgrate the storage of the above solution to EFS

and so on and so on.

The architecture evolution is designed so that each stage, requires you to recall and reestablish the knowledge of the step before which helps commit it.

Also.. im a strong believer in learning communities ([https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com)) by being part of study groups and architecture channels you will keep everything fresh/refreshed.

I get your frustration, my students have told me before starting my course they had the same thing - but the layering approach has fixed it for most people.

* Take notes as you go through each module in Notepad or Onenote.  Then go back and view the notes again to reinforce what you learned.  
* Make sure to Follow along with the course and do the hands-on with an AWS Free Tier account to reinforce the concepts.  
* After finishing the content, try your hand at practice exams to identify any gaps in your learning., I took Bonzo's test exams on Udemy which were helpful.  The point of the practice tests is to see what areas you need to focus on.
* It also can be helpful to go through courses from multiple providers.  Different course authors explain things differently, and it may help cement things if you hear it from different teachers.

I have passed the 3 assoc. AWS exams and am now studying the SA Pro.  I purchased Adrian Cantrill's AWS SA Assoc. and SA Pro courses from [https://learn.cantrill.io/](https://learn.cantrill.io/) and am going through the Associate course first to reinforce what I have already learned before I move on to his SA Pro course.

g1tuiyq,iaygrc,"Hi [u/Dubya12](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dubya12)

With the vast online resources we have today; you can pursue anything as long as you stay focused and committed. For starters, you can check our [free ebook](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/journey-to-cloud-a-free-beginners-guide-to-aws/) about the beginner's guide to cloud computing. Getting certified is a major factor if you want to break into the cloud industry.

Since you have an IT background, I recommend you to take the Solutions Architect Associate Certification instead of the Cloud Practitioner. In terms of value, the former is considered higher and more in demand. Freecodecamp has a [free course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia-UEYYR44s&amp;t=12191s) on Youtube if you don't want to spend money.

After studying, validate your knowledge with our [high-quality practice exams](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/). We offer questions in different modes. For example, There is a Section-based test mode where you can focus and answer questions on specific topics/domains only. This mode is helpful when you're studying and want to pinpoint your weak spots on particular services.",2.0
g1wgvyw,iaygrc,Thank you for the response. My biggest worry right now is my lack of experience and lack of coding skills. Would skipping the CP cert hurt me on the job hunt? And would I be able to land a job as a Solutions Architect without relevant experience? I am willing to put in the time and effort while working around my current job to get the certifications but I am worried that won‚Äôt be nearly enough for me to land a job,1.0
g1yaoyv,iaygrc,"that is only promoting his own offerings like the rest of the leaches. have no clue besides that he wants to get rich quickly.

i think that if you have no experience and no coding skills you have to start somewhere. the CCP is the lowest, the entry level where some of the basics are mentioned. You have to start somewhere. you can start reading the white papers from aws, the shorter ones and get a feeing for the topic and the services. try some of the mock questions to find any of the services you want to start looking into more. like i said you have to start somewhere since you are a freshman. check out the free concepts courses on youtube for the ccp. if they are too fast in covering the topic, go back and listen to it again and cross check&gt;/consult  the white papers or ""dummies"" series. books can be a little outdated so the aws web is a good bet. print out on paper if that feels better.",0.0

g1s8odn,iaygrc,"Most solution architects that I know are also software engineers. I only have experience with startups. It might be different at an enterprises level company where SA's are a dedicated role. 

TLDR: in my experience SA's are usually software engineers and there usualy also devops.",1.0
g1uksli,iaygrc,"Yes you can learn I had no previous tech experience before I started.  Just start with the Certified Cloud Practitioner Course and then the Solution Architect Associate.  I used ExamPro's CCP course, it has hands on, practice exams, flashcards etc.  they also have free video's on freeCodeCamp but if you go to there website they have free videos there as well but I would highly recommend there practice exams.

g1uu559,iaygrc,"There are plenty of resources to help you get there.  You don't need development experience to move into a DevOps or admin role, but it does help greatly. As for a SA role, you definitely need dev experience.  Plenty of good replies already but my advice is to dive into each of these areas - not too deeply in any one to start, test your knowledge with some hands on, then revisit the weak spots or anywhere you pause and have doubts when testing or playing.  As you spend time learning to do hands on, you will find where you really need to go deeper.

areas:

\- networking - you do not need certs here just need to really understand the basics, and you will run into the need to get deeper on other areas. 

\- security - again concepts to start including firewalls, VPN, TLS/SSL/SSH, and then focus on cloud based security concepts.  Roles - if  you were on a domain  you should have been exposed to some role based sec groups, etc.  This transfers generally to cloud sec roles in concept, then hands on will force you to understand the specifics in the platform you choose.  

\- code/dev - not sure your preference, I'd suggest Python due to simplicity and wide use in dev and in AWS.  Check out Automate the Boring Stuff (course on Udemy or the book - which you can get free from the website I think).  It will get you some basic concepts and bootstrap you a bit to work on other pieces in AWS. Take on some small app / web projects to add to your skills there.  

\- virtualization - VM, containers, serverless, PaaS, IaaS, etc. so many branches now, but all related to the core concept you should get very familiar with to start. Then you can get into finer details.  

Lots more for a SA role, but these are some critical areas I'd suggest.",1.0

g1s2i9r,iaxdye,"So far I have not failed any AWS Cert test. But I would say that I start with failure (on practice tests) and then while watching Maarek I pay attention to those areas I failed (or didn't know) to reinforce what I didn't know. 

I would say...that before I started my AWS Cert journey....I ""failed"" in thinking pluralsight was the best site to get information on. It wasn't until I stumbled upon this subreddit that I realized I probably would have failed the SAA due to the really bad Kaplan/Transcender tests and just lack of ""cohesion"" in the material. Udemy has way better teachers in Maarek, Davis, and Vora (depending on which style suits you).  Still need to shoutout to Jon Bonso and his practice exams.....still the best!

Thanks to this subreddit, I avoided failure, rescheduled my test for 2 weeks later and watched Stephane Maarek's course in that time to give me a full month to study. 

From that point on, its been success. 

However, no matter how many cert tests I take....by the time I'm done, I always feel like I failed. I'm always pleasantly surprised at the ""PASS"" I get.

So sorry there is no concrete ""failure"" but I think failure has driven me to search our for new resources and hear different opinions. That way.......you can look at the same material in different ways. The SAA is a prime example of sooooo much material and practice tests out there. No one way is right......but each way can teach you something new.",3.0
g1s5433,iaxdye,"I passed the CLF-C01 on 8/16/19.  I failed the SAA-C01 5 times and the SAA-C02 Beta exam over the course of 10 months.  The last time I took the SAA-C01 was 7/31/20, I got a 700.  But then I stopped overthinking the questions and was able to pass the SAA-C02 on 7/15/20, then passed the DVA-C01 on 8/7/20, then passed the SOA-C01 on 8/13/20, then passed the SCS-C01 on 8/19/20.

The key is to not get discouraged, use lots of different training materials, and know that you will pass when you understand the material enough.  

My job required me to have the AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert, so there was pressure about getting it.  Now that I have it, I don‚Äôt feel that pressure and feel that I‚Äôm past the mental block I was having.  I‚Äôm taking the AWS Alexa Skill Builder Specialty exam before the end of the month.

g1qs6vr,iatgao,"Just FYI, Jon Bonso tests are rock solid for SAA an CDA but for SysOps you will need to explore other resources. After I was done with Stephane course and Bonso's test, I spent few days reading exam experience of recent SysOps test takers which were posted in this sub-reddit. You will find few topics which are not covered thoroughly in SM course and JB tests. You will need to check AWS documentation to cover those topics.",4.0
g1t3nn9,iatgao,"I just passed the SysOps (waiting for score) and I did not use additional resources. Only Stephane Maarek and Jon Bonso. I read the threads which did say that SysOps was harder but I did not find my version ridculously hard at all. 

That being said, many test questions were similar to Bonso but some of them did not go deep enough for sure. I think the best thing for me was being able to read the questions quickly and narrow choices down to a 50/50 answer or eliminate processes. 

If you are taking taking the test over and over, you can have some bad side effects if you only memorize, you do not fully understand all the services being presented to you, etc. 

The topics I felt that were not well covered (and I want to preface this with.....SM and Bonso are still the best combo) are:

AWS Organizations advanced
AWS service catalog vs Deployment with Cloudformation and ways to tag resources
AWS Billing in depth (mainly to do with more scenarios that would be test like)

Without knowing how I did I felt weak there. But using the techniques bonso and maarek have shown me on the SAA, DVA and CCP, I limited down the possible answers and talkdd myself through them.

There are not as many resources out there for this as there are the for the SAA or DVA. So do your best with what you have. 

A personal tip that I do on Bonso's test is to talk to myself and explain why the wrong answers are wrong. Like maybe the service mentioned has nothing to do with Auditing, or that this service uses a server and the question is asking about serverless.",4.0

g1uvl4r,iatgao,"In all honestly, not really. No questions about cfn-init or cfn-signal like I got through Bonso's practice exams. Maybe it was just my version of the exam. 

CloudFormation was a possible answer for a few questions but most were related to how to keep Cloudformation Windows AMI updated over time. I believe the answers here lied in SSM features.

I do remember a question regarding Change Sets/Nested Stacks that were similar what Bonso has in his practice exams. 

I felt like I got more questions on AWS Billing/reporting/tags etc than I did CloudFormation.",1.0
g1v0xxx,iatgao,"Bingo. So I had same ""easy"" version of the exam which is passable just using SM course and JB practice tests.

g1v2elq,iatgao,"I hope that SM and JB will go through revisions and update the courses. I know they spent a lot of time for the SAA. But the amount of material out there for the SysOps was not as much as the SAA or even the DVA.

I'm going to be prepping for the Pro level certs so hopefully I won't have to take the Associate levels for a good long while and I can keep them refreshed with the pro ones.

If you are not really familiar with cloud computing or AWS, the AWS Cloud Practitioner is a great starting point.

If you are looking for hands on labs in AWS, there are plenty in LA but don't expect support or people to answer any questions in the community or on Slack. The quality you'll see is just not there compared to the Adrian's Slack channel. It has been my personal experience to get blown out by Sean Gaulin on the Slack channel asking a question on migration and I receive no followup on questions I post in the community. So, if you need a gentle introduction to AWS and a few other courses like linux or containers, sure try it out. I personally would not at this stage and am actually considering closing my account.

 If your company is paying for it, go for it or get a 7 day free trial and check it out.

As an example, the IAM course from acloudguru is about 1 hour long and not specific to AWS. No info on using the CLI or setting up federation or SSO. It is so bizarre to see actually. The previous IAM course was about 8 hours long, was specific to AWS and has labs.

With your own AWS account and PDFs of AWS documentation including the FAQS and user guides, you'll do just fine on the exam if not better. Then use Adrian's course as a source for ""need to know"" for the exam.

g1q21wh,iak5le,"I havent passed , yet.  But here is my take:

So first , lets leave Cloud Guru aside. on udemey I have taken their course and practice quiz. They are too easy and dont compare with the other two. 

But I will tell you that even Stephans' test don't come close to Jon Bonso. Based on the price , I would say get both Stepahn and Jon's Practice tests. Saving money (probably 15$ on udemy) is not worth it. You should  be exposed to various question writing style.",3.0

You can cut out answers pretty easily just by asking if it's serverless or not. EC2/Elastic Beanstalk are easy ones to cut out since neither are serverless, and neither can store data natively. I don't think I'd consider ElastiCache a serverless service, as it's not really related to ""servers"" and more just deals with the edge location caching.

g1nbwkk,iadho7,"Don‚Äôt do the cloud practitioner on its own. It‚Äôs next to useless on its own. The exam *is* worth doing, but it‚Äôs worth doing on the way to Solutions Architect Associate. The content is a subset of the SAA, the exam is cheaper, so you can do it as a nice intro to the exam system before taking the more expensive SAA exam.

If you have no IT experience, get the right course. There is a great trainer here on Reddit u/acantril who makes his own courses at http://learn.cantrill.io . His course is great because it includes lots of supplementary lessons on surrounding topics you need to know about general IT topics if you don‚Äôt already have that knowledge, which you need to then apply to AWS. It really is an all inclusive course. 

So to answer your question yes it absolutely is possible to go from your position into aws. But go for SAA, and just take the CCP exam along the way. Adrians course for example covers both so you can get the two certs for the one course. 

Although I have years of IT experience, I was able to certify up to Professional level with Adrians courses. My years in IT just meant I could skip the IT background lessons and focus on the aws specifics. But it‚Äôs all there.",4.0

g1oc5s7,iadho7,"Hey, Thank you so much for sharing this information. I will check the course that you mentioned. Any idea how long it could take roughly if I dedicate 5-6 hours each day and if this certification can fetch me a job. I am not working at present due to the market scenario here in Toronto and one of my colleagues mentioned that this could be a game-changer for me.",1.0
g1pu0z5,iadho7,"That‚Äôs a bit difficult to answer but the course has to be 50 hours minimum, if not more. There‚Äôs a lot of good stuff in it. 

Make sure you follow the hands-on demo lessons, there‚Äôs lots of them, and some of them you may want to go back over and do again just to make sure it‚Äôs sunk in, so that may take a little time. 

The practitioner won‚Äôt land you a job, but the exam is still worth doing anyway (plus when you pass you get a 50% off your next exam voucher, which makes the architect associate one cheaper). The SAA has the potential to open some doors for you. Just without any IT experience you‚Äôre going to be relying heavily on explaining on your resume about your interest in it and time spent re-training. Apply for some entry level aws roles and it will certainly help start the conversations. 

If you have any interest in it and you have the time to study, absolutely go for it. All the material you need is in Adrians course.",1.0
g1nvh2b,iadho7,"People that get the CCP usually are in sales and need a foundational knowledge of what AWS is but it is a step in the right direction.

[https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-test/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-test/)

I really enjoyed the ACloudGuru course because they were very detailed about everything despite it just being a regurgitation of the white papers for the most part. It included ""Labs"" as well as lectures. The labs mainly consisted of following the video through configuring all the services in your own AWS account.

The Udemy practice tests were immensely helpful. I went through them all and got \~60%-70% on my first try, and then retook them over the course of a week and a half with 96%+ in every test. Most of the questions on the Udemy course were almost identical to the questions on the actual exam, but with different multiple choice answers. If you do use these tests, make sure to read the explanations on EVERY question, including the ""Why this question is incorrect"" parts, because I learned a lot of relevant information I didn't even know from them explaining that X service is not as relevant as some other X service.

I just took the test today and passed it, still waiting on my results! I will most likely continue using ACloudGuru to study for the SAA exam, as I'd like to use my current CCP knowledge for that, and then decide which direction i'd like to go from there.

g1jqhvq,i9kj5p,What‚Äôs the correct answer?,1.0
g1jyeor,i9kj5p,"When I wrote the question, I did not know the answer. But I think I have come to following understanding.  


EBS volumes, in order to have a snapshot feature, keep a table /bitmap view of all the blocks. The table contains information whether a certain block has changed since last snap shot was taken.

When a snapshot is initiated, the snapshot process picks up all such block which have changed since last snap shots and copies those to snapshot, there by creating an incremental backup.

Consider the case, when a large number of such blocks needs to be copied and the volume is being used. If such a use writes on to a block that is needed to be copied to snapshot, going through with the write operation will mean that the state of snapshot will not accurately represent the state of the volume when the snapshot was initiated.

For that reason, such write operations will need to be delayed, so that copy operation finishes before the write operation.

All of that is when you have only one snapshot is in progress.  When you have multiple snapshots in progress, such collisions are bound be amplified.

Hence I would select ""Even one in-progress snapshot can degrade the performance. ""

One important note: Only write operations can cause such collisions.",1.0

g1hsq52,i9ftym,"Hello!

We have indeed merged. While the companies have been merging for some months into meshing all of the various gears with a focus on providing the best combined platform for our learners.

The magnificent Terry Cox (SVP of Content for Linux Academy) has continued that role in the combined A Cloud Guru. And we've done a ton of work to get the best of both platforms in terms of content. Most of the Linux Academy content creators are still here, and we're all learning a ton from our A Cloud Guru colleagues, and they're learning a lot from us. It really has been a great experience which I was very apprehensive of personally when the acquisition was announced. But at every turn the combined car has gone the direction I've hoped for. 

I'm currently working on a course that I'm excited for people to see as it will be some of the first content created for the combined platform that brings both styles together into something new. 

So, will the style of content change? Sure, will we keep the Linux Academy depth? You bet!

One of those turning points that we learned about very early on was that we're continuing our commitment to grandfathered pricing. So the Linux Academy subscriber that has had an active account since they were $5/month will keep that price and the same features they've had access to since they signed up. 

To end this ramble... everyone should know we're committed to, and driven by doing what is best for our subscribers to help them reach their goals. We have some bumps to navigate in the road, and some rough edges to polish still, but internally seeing the process I have faith that the right skills are in place to provide the best learning experience possible.",1.0

If it were easy, everyone would have it. They design it specifically to be tough. 

I would say, wait and get your test score, and see how close you were. See if it‚Äôs worth going and retaking straight away, or if you need to regroup and go back through material.",3.0
g1febjn,i9e00j,"Hey, I have had that feeling about an exam multiple times. It will pass no worries :) Also, considering you were attempting to pass an exam that requires over 2 years of experience crammed into one test, you failing it doesn't reflect badly on you but stands as a testament to how challenging it can be. 


That being said I did pass the SA Pro on the first attempt. The key thing you should focus on is time. If you see a question that takes up the full page in text it's probably worth flagging. And this exam has a lot of questions that has you reading pages to answer a relatively simple question, which brings me to my next point. Instead of reading the entire question carefully, it's much more time efficient to search for key words that ring a bell. Eg when you hear relational database you think RDS, if you hear querying s3 you think Athena, running docker containers -&gt; ECS, etc. 

This way, when you see a long question, you're not spending time reading fillers but actual parts that are vital to the question itself. Also, in case you're uncertain whether or not you're ready if you pass the practice test you can usually pass the exam.",3.0

g1dxfqf,i8rfe9,"Unfortunately, Udemy doesn't have this capability. And unfortunately as well, creating Pro-level practice exams require a tremendous amount of effort. It took us an average of 3 hours to come up with, polish, and further finetune each question in our SA-Pro practice test course. And I think it's also the reason why you won't see a lot of high-quality practice test providers for Pro-level exams.

When we have the bandwidth to expand our pool of questions, we will certainly add more. But not in the immediate future as Jon and the rest of the technical team are pretty swamped with the maintenance and creation of new courses, including a few non-AWS ones. üôÇ",2.0

Why 'anything' is not a resource ?",1.0
g1gfwel,i8plfv,"""**Anything**"" here in this context is an Action Type. A very important distinction because you could, in essence, '**eat**' many different things from the cookie jar. ie you could perform many different types of **Actions** (eat a cookie, eat a chocolate or eat anything at all) on the **Resource** (cookie jar). From chocolates, to cookies to sweets to whatever other crazinesses you choose to store in your cookie jars :) But here we are specifying ""**eat anything**"". Where in AWS Policy syntax we could write eat a cookie as `eat:cookie`, for the Action type for ""eat anything"" we describe this as `eat:*`. What this means is all things that can be eaten, because the asterisk (\*) is a wildcard in AWS. A legit AWS example of a specific Action Type could be `ec2:startInstances`. And an example of a wildcard in AWS could be `ec2:*`

I hope that clarifies things :) thanks so much for reading my blog and I really hope you enjoyed it! Feel free to leave a clap on the medium post that would mean a lot!

g19xwrr,i8n931,"This type of post bothers me as much as the inverse (because there is nuance)

The whole concept of 'getting a certification' bothers me. You describe it as 'just a piece of paper' and there are many people who think the same way ... i call that a 'fake cert'. It has literally 0 value.

If people are going through the effort to get certified, the only sensible thing is to also gain the knowledge and skills you should gain through that process. A cert should be evidence of capability and skills .. if you have both you can easily get a job.

I have a list of students who've taken my SAA-C02 course, achieved the certification and got a job - and keep in mind before hand they had no AWS experience. But this isn't the same 'get the certification' as you describe in the video....(because I value real skills)

I think we .. as an industry, need to stop describing the process of 'fake passing' a cert as 'getting a certification'. If you don't have the skills, confidence and capability to back up a cert - you really don't have the cert...not really :)

A fake cert benefits nobody - no value to you, because it's fake. No value to your employer because if they are an AWS shop, their lack of real capability will be found out.

A real cert + associated knowing is valuable to you, to your employer... everyone is happy.

Full disclosure I create courses for AWS at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) and I proudly DONT aim for just certs .. i teach skills :) and maintain AFAIK a 100% pass rate. Courses which just teach to pass certs are a scourge on our industry IMO :)",9.0

You should always do the Solutions Architect associate first IMO /u/joeyfine 

Its a foundational certification with a broad scope and it helps you learn about all of the AWS products and services and how they fit together.

Once you have that... then you can either do sysops associate or security specialty.

My concern re. speciality certs is that normally i suggest viewing them as 50/50 split between AWS skills and the speciality area (security in this case)

I normally advise on doing a specialty only if either 1) you have PRO level AWS skills or 2) you are REALLY good in the specialty area, ideally both.

My normal suggestion for anyone thinking about specialties would be 

SA Associate

SA Pro

Then the specialty of choice.

The security specialty is one of the easier specs though... so you might be able to handle it without issue if you do SA Associate , sysops associate and then security spec.

All of the above is based on my assumption you want to actually learn the tech to a level where its useful for a job ... not just passing the certification.

The fact is if someone exploits any form of admin style credentials on an AWS account .. the account acts as the boundary for that exploit. Nothing for example that you put in place within an account covers account root user credential leak.

Creating additional accounts with seperate credentials is a great fix for this so your boss is right.

/u/Network94 regarding your comment about SAA cert scheduled for the weekend and you being concerned you should know this ... you absolutely should know this.

Full disclosure i create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) including one for the SA Associate

One of the first things I teach is AWS Account architecture .. what they are, how to use them and what benefits they provide for authroisation and authentication - security credentials and blast radius being one core thing i teach.

g12b1mw,i7j28s,"HI /u/thebrownmadman

I'm going to disagree with you, but not for the reason you think

&gt; I know you can‚Äôt land a job with just a certification

Most people who struggle to get jobs ... do so because they get a cert, but don't study with the idea to get the skills which should go along with it.

The way i often look at this, if you imagine what an Associate level AWS SA should now ... lets say thats 10 'units' of knowledge. You will find there are exam crams which teach you the exact '2' units required to answer just the exam questions. There are courses which focus on the exam teaching say '5' - '6' units. And then there is courses which focus on real skills or self study or real world experience which represents the '10'

Full disclosure (i create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io)) and my stuff is designed, unapologetically, to get people into work in this field - the 100% pass rate is just a side effect of that.

I spend time giving students demos and mini projects to do (available free here [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) ) which help give REAL skills.

I know of at least 10 of my students now who have used the demos in the above github link as justification of experience in job interviews .. 

Focus on learning stuff, focus on implementing mini projects. Join a community such as [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) and get involved. Join linkedin (if you havent already) and start networking. Find a mentor ...someone who will help guide you. 

Do all of that and jobs will come. It's not just about certification, but certification and the knowledge is a good first step.

(full disclosure i create courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) )

The normal route is all associates and then devops. THis is mainly because most devops pro courses expect a certain level of knowledge and most associate courses are exam focussed and not skills focused.

I created my SA Associate course for example to be Associate SA (150%) or thereabouts, meaning my students will be able to jump directly to SA Pro without much trouble. I'm going to also design my Devops course to allow that same jump.. and also to directly jump from my upcoming developer and sysops associate courses.

The jump to pro has to happen at some point ... it just depends more on your skill levels and the courses you've used.

I made my course so that other resources aren't required - even while I was studying back in the day i never liked the way its accepted that multiple courses are needed. In other areas of life, we buy 1 thing for 1 task - seems silly that its the norm to use multiple courses for 1 exam.

Anyway, this isn't a reply about using my course of Stephane's ...

Its just me saying that my associate course AFAIK has 100% pass rate, jobs as a result and the vast majority of my students only need this single course.

I'm a total cloud/technical noob (I've been in sales roles, but this AWS sales role is technical and requires me to know more about the technology/services), so I found the CP to be helpful in establishing a base-line -- then the SAA dives deeper into each one and you start piecing together theory + real-life application.

(full disclosure i create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) )

So the warning signs here 

&gt;The practice questions seem to have these obscure details and it's quite discouraging. 

The SA Associate isn't an exam where you should be focussing on remembering details - what matters is a knowledge of the products and how they fit together. What situations should you and should you NOT use a certain product.

if you feel like the sentence above ... obscure details .. then i dont think you know the topic enough (that might be hard to hear, but i genuinely want to help)

Those tutorialsdojo scores are really worrying, there is no way i would attempt the exam with those .. and the danger is you are probably 'remembering' some of the right answers too

So i would suggest this

1. Join [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) there is a #saa-c02-studygroup which might help
2. Have a look through [https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html](https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html) and [https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course](https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course) and make sure there is nothing on there which you are freaked out by.
3. Do those practice tests from [tutorialsdojo.com](https://tutorialsdojo.com) and record all the wrong answers you get (the Q and the A). Group them into subject areas (compute, storage, networking and so on)
4. For each area .. go through all the wrong questions
5. With NO assumptions, and no arrogance .. review why
6. (a) the right answers are right and (b) the wrong answers are wrong.
7. Reestablish patterns of why you are misreading questions and not picking up on the key parts which give you the right and wrong answers
8. Repeat this for the other question subject areas.

(full disclosure i create training at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) \- it's not relevant to my answer below, but I always disclose)

I get my students of my courses to setup 3 AWS accounts brand new for every course (as i teach AWS organisations, SSO, cross account stuff).

All you need is a unique email address for each ... and if you use gmail you can use the dynamic aliases feature to essentially have unlimited emails via the one account

i.e

[adrian@gmail.com](mailto:adrian@gmail.com) (assume this is my normal gmail)

[adrian+aws1@gmail.com](mailto:adrian+aws1@gmail.com) also goes to that account

[adrian+aws2@gmail.com](mailto:adrian+aws2@gmail.com) also goes to that account

and so on - anything after the '+' can be set to whatever you want, and it all goes into the same account.

Think of AWS accounts as throwaway, make one, use it for training, discard it, make a new one. You get the free tier benefit and you get to isolate your training from everything else meaning no risk.

I keep all my training close to 0 cost based on that.

Do I need to basically put my full normal address as is? I feel like that will throw a red flag up if they ever check as they can query and see I have multiple accounts associated with the same address.

Is there a basic solution you suggest for that? I forgot AWS asks for all this stuff.",1.0

expect the exam to be equally as hard or more so.

I had similar experiences to what‚Äôs already been mentioned, and only did the first exam:
 - The wording of the questions and answers is SUPER brief, which is good to focus just on knowledge retention (I.e. almost like flash cards). However this needs to be positioned correctly because this Q&amp;A format doesn‚Äôt replicate the exams
 - Some of the answers didn‚Äôt look correct, or were potentially wrong
 - Following on from above, what other practise exams do well that really aids the learning experience is provide detailed worked answers. Adding this can help clear up discrepancies with the correct answers per the test vs what I think are the answers.

g0s1wvg,i5ndu8,"I'm going to slightly disagree with u/acantril I don't think its useless but not for the reasons you might think.

The CCP is a subset of the SAA. Adrian's course covers it, you could probably take the first third of his SAA course and pass the CCP along the way.

It is worth it because it's cheaper than the other exams. You can take that, and then get a 50% off voucher for your next exam (which will be more expensive) so is a nice incentive and makes it a not overly expensive exam to pass in the grand scheme of things. Passing the CCP is also a nice little personal boost along the way to achieving SAA. So you can effectively pass two certs for the price of one course.  Also it's a nice intro to the testing system, so you can go through the process of an actual exam and be acquainted with it before going and doing a more expensive one.  Plus it helps to pad out those aws certs on the CV.

I would say absolutely go for it.  It has its uses, but not so much for helping land a job. It's not overly highly regarded or sought after compared to the SAA, but it has uses for you if you are going to continue the AWS education path just not so much on its own.

Its actually (knowledge wise) a subset of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate cert ... but the CCP is so much less well regarded by employers or anyone else in the industry, it's hardly worth it.

I've had a few students who have started my SA Associate course, who were newcomers to IT (people career switching) or new comers to AWS and they managed fine on the SA Associate. I'm sure there are others who disagree and thats ok :)

I designed my SA Associate course to be newcomer friendly, it starts from the foundations (probably the same level as CCP's entry point) but at the end you will have skills which are much more valuable to an employer .. and the skills gained will be more valuable to you personally.

I'd also recommend joining a community if you are serious about learning ... [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) is a good one ..

g0plro4,i5hl79,"I used basically the same for every thing:

Mareek course + Jon Bonso tests.

One thing to be extremely aware of when your taking the tests however:  On the first pass - really try your hardest on the first go around.  This is when you will learn the most and have the best representation of how well you know the material.

It is still important to go through the test more than once, however I find that once you have seen the question no matter what there is a sort of ""comfort"" due to the fact you have seen the question already and don't gain anything new.

So be careful mindlessly going through the tests.  If you find yourself answering just based off memory I think its kind of pointless.

I personally think Jon or udemy should add some sort of shuffling feature for the tests so that the order is not the same.

I personally did two passes of every jon bonso test every time.  The stuff that I did not understand well I rewatched mareeks courses on the topics to solidify, also in addition to reading jon bonsos explanations.

On the day prior to the test, I made sure I got 8 hours of sleep.  On the day of the test I did one practice test early in the day and reviewed topics up until it was test time and made sure to carb up for food.",3.0

Learn how to automate with the AWS CLI -- this may involve learning enough bash/shell scripting to write simple scripts to automate creating a bucket and updating public settings. Sometimes you need something quick and dirty to get the job done.

Learn boto3:  [https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) 

boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. I spend a good part of my day reading boto3 documentation while I'm creating/updating Python scripts for my job.

Also, as a part of learning Python/boto3 read up on handling exceptions (try/except):  [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) Some parts of boto3 won't cleanly handle when something is missing.

For example, if you try to get a s3 bucket policy from a bucket that doesn't have a policy, an exception is thrown and your script will die \*UNLESS YOU WRAP THE CALL IN TRY/EXCEPT BLOCK\*. You will need try/except so your script can do one thing (create a new bucket policy) versus another thing (update an existing policy) cleanly without manual intervention.",15.0

Learn how to do basic things like if/then, while and for loops, and how to create an executable shell script. It's something you can spend a day or two once you've got Python/AWS CLI/boto3 down.

The main thing is if you are repeatedly doing something manual, try to see if you can automate it.

If you have to do the following multiple times, can you write a AWS CLI/bash script or Python script to do it (eg just type [scriptname.py](https://scriptname.py) bucket to do it all)?  
\* create a bucket  
\* change public permissions  
\* assign a role with certain permissions

Finally, learn to use source control (try something like [https://github.com](https://github.com) to store stuff you write). If you get a job, you'll often be using source control to access/create/modify scripts and code to do your job.

The SA associate focuses on what the main AWS services can achieve for businesses when used together. A high-level understanding of what each service does, how it fits in and integrates with other services, and how they ultimately solve business problems will earn you a passing score. There are lots of questions on limitations and details about the services - but all of this you can get from AWS FAQs, whitepapers, other AWS documentation and from online courses. I‚Äôd recommend ‚ÄúA Cloud Guru‚Äù - it‚Äôs helped me pass five exams now.

If you are lacking understanding of a particular service, I highly recommend watching re:Invent videos about them. The speakers from the videos really go from a high-level overview of AWS service to its demonstration. It is free and you'll get a lot of valuable information from it.

Validate your knowledge through our [practice exams](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/).

Also, before taking the exam, I recommend checking first a rundown of a [comparison of AWS services](https://tutorialsdojo.com/comparison-of-aws-services/). The real exam will trick you into asking about services that have ""similar"" features and goals ( i.e. CloudFront vs. Global Accelerator ). So it is really critical to know how one service is different from another. Good luck!

The whizlabs was excellent and the most similar and realistic to the test by far compared to any other practice exams i took. I also highly recommend the free AWS courses on the Solutions Architect i found those videos extremely helpful especially when breaking down the process of elimination in the questions and answers.

Exciting !!! so I have a few things I would throw your way

Full disclosure - i create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) but none of the stuff below is specific to me, just general help.

1 - [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) \- this is i think the best online learning community available. 7k members but unlike some of the bigger communities this one is super active. We have general topic channels, study group channels, job channels, community projects and if you wanted to create your own dedicated study group channel - just give me a yell.

2 - [https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html](https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html) i wrote this with some topic suggestions to focus on.

3 - Study notes from one of my students [https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course](https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course) really useful

4 - Once you get started keep an eye on this [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) i make a lot of the demos free which i create for my courses to help out the community.

Hope this helps... the advice I would give

1 - Don't rush - whether you take 2 weeks, 2 months or 6 ... in a year or two's time, when you start to get the value from the knowledge you gain, it will seem like a pointless difference

2 - make sure whatever content you choose, you are using SAA-C02 content, there is SO MUCH which is really C01 ...

3 - Focus on learning AWS... gaining skills (theory and practical).. and passing the exam as a result of that. Don't think about the cert as the end goal ... the end goal should be knowledge, the cert just evidences that (this will change how you study)

g0etuq8,i3s8oz,"Start with AWS innovator island found on YouTube, 5 part series. Do the resume challenge, found on google easily. Just think of something you want to build, break down in to small pieces, watch videos on those pieces, find step by step projects with those pieces in it, build it out. Fail and fail again. Learn things as you go like taking a python course once you get to writing the lambda functions; use github repositories to find similar functions and play around with it.

It‚Äôs not easy, but if you know how things should interact or be set up it‚Äôs just a matter of tweaking things and knowing what you‚Äôre looking at or how to find what you want to be looking at. 

Every piece of my project was discussed at length in Internet forums or YouTube videos. Obviously you need to know how route53, CloudFront, API Gateway, ECS, EC2, S3, cognito user pools/federation, and lambda works, and how to trigger/direct environment pieces to endpoints within your environment, then back to the front end. You learn some of that while studying and then just play around with it, and when it doesn‚Äôt work go down the google rabbit hole of endless forums and videos.

Example project: users create accounts on a simple website to upload media files to a library in their account and create thumbnails of those media files. Allow user to be able to download their files from anywhere in the world. Make sure no other users can access their files, and that everything is encrypted. 

Break it down. Go down the rabbit hole. Learn it along the way. Trial by fire bae beeeee. How are you going to direct the user to their account page? How are you going to create the web UI medium that connects user to back end processing and media send/receive? How are you going to save their session state? How are you going to secure their files and make sure only they can access them? Where are you putting the files? What about their meta data? How do you direct media requests to where it‚Äôs located in storage? What are the best practices? How the hell do you write a lambda function to create the thumbnail? Can you do that? How do you map the back end? Are you using step functions state machines? Are you using S3 events which send to sqs que which triggers lambda or ec2 or ecs worker group? How the hell do you show the user their library on the website UI? What parts of this need to be CI/CD to help with easy updates/changes? How much can I deploy using CloudFormation? How do I even start learning to write CloudFormation templates? What do you do when you have no idea? What process do you create to break it all down and figure out each piece and how it goes together and how to implement it effectively? 

That‚Äôs a Developer Solutions Architect. 

Now that my friend is a rabbit hole filled with hard earned knowledge and skills and a fortified mental map of how things work.

Anyone can post git hub repositories and step by step guides, but that won‚Äôt make you ready for real world application. Because when they ask you how do you do this or how WOULD you do this, and why? There are two ways you respond; with a surface level and fumbled answer which was rehearsed and has no ability to discuss deviating paths, or a deeply learned explanation with visuals burned in to your head of the trail and errors which you can go in to detail about and discuss possible modifications and options within services, functions, or the front/back end mapping.",9.0

But at scale AWS, architected correctly, using the most up to date best practices, is the best.

AZURE fan boys are in denial. And if you think you can do something better on another cloud platform, you just haven‚Äôt heard of new AWS releases which address shortfalls as they come about.

this is normal ...nobody should beat themselves up over it.

I normally tell my students that the first practice exam they do will be a 60-70% average because exam and question technique is a different set of skills to actually being able to work with AWS. There are two phases ... learn AWS well... and then translate this into being able to answer exam questions.

I always recommend the tutorialsdojo questions because they really force you to perfect your exam skills .. combined with the knowledge i try and provide in my course ive found it super effective.

g0d3pka,i3ohwt,"Personally, I find it pretty easy to switch between Azure and AWS, they are much more alike than different. 

AZ-900 is pretty similar to AWS Cloud Practitioner, in many cases it‚Äôs a case of just learning to translate service names from AWS to Azure. There are some minor differences (e.g. availability sets), but nothing much, and often if a service exists in AWS, it exists in similar form in Azure but with a different name. The entry Azure cert is much easier than AWS SAA. However, like AWS Cloud Practitioner, AZ-900 is much too high level to be very useful.

5. Take your time, do this for each question you get wrong
6. Maybe 1-2 days per subject area - go back to the course to get the answers

g09ghbd,i35erz,"Hi /u/howtopassawscert

I'll jump in since you mentioned my course ([https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) for anyone interested)

Im not going to jump in and suggest you buy another course  - im not going to say not too, but i dont think thats the issue here

Passing exams and knowing content are two different skills.

Most of my students get 60-70% on the first practice exam they do, because they are not yet practiced  at how to spot keywords or break apart question scenarios and pick the right products .

My suggestion would be as follows

AFAIK that freecodecamp thing is for SAA-C01 ... if you watch the first few videos it has the SAA-C01 exam document there... so focus on C02 content only.

1. Go through a practice test (Stephanes and Tutorialsdojo seem logical)
2. For any wrong answers, group them together by subject area (compute, storage, networking and so on)
3. Assume NOTHING
4. Review each answer .. research why its wrong (even if its stupid, UNDERSTAND why its wrong). Confirm your understanding of why the right answer is right.
5. Take your time, do this for each question you get wrong
6. Maybe 1-2 days per subject area - go back to the course to get the answers
7. Repeat the process and then move onto a new practice test.

Eventually you will re-train your brain with the correct links between topics/keywords/scenarios and answers.

My advice would be you're focussing on LOTS of stuff, and there are some bad resources in that list. Drop the FAQ's, Drop freecodecamp, Drop AWS official stuff, Drop Well architected, Drop Qwik ... spend more time on what remains.

in summary - don't feel bad, EVERYONE starts off like you on their first few tests :)",6.0

When taking our practice exams, be sure to read all the explanations given at the end of each question. Read them even if you got the correct answer. You might find new information/topics that could potentially be critical at the exam. If you're having a difficult time with some services, I suggest watching a re:invent video about them. Usually, they cover AWS services on a high level first, then deep dive and show some demo at the end. It is excellent, go check it out.

Full disclosure I create courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) ... but that isn't relevant to the below, nor does it introduce a bias .. i say it only to have said it :)

So as a checkpoint have a look through this [https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html](https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html) which is an article i wrote about the main areas of knowledge you need.

Also look through this ... which is a set of notes one of my students created (who passed) [https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course](https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course)

Assuming that you look through both of those.. and think that you are in the right ballpark ... then i would move onto some exam practice (as this is a different set of skills)

Regarding exam practice .. there are two rules you need to follow (these sound simple, but REALLY focus on them)

1. Don't memorise answers in the practice tests .. it will make you more confident than you should be.
2. Make 0 assumptions in the process below

My usual practice process

1. Do a practice exam
2. when you get the results ... throw away all questions you got correct
3. for the ones you got wrong, order them into subject areas (storage, networking, compute etc)
4. Pick one group per 1-2 day period
5. for that group step through questions and challenge yourself (remember no assumptions) to show why the answers you picked are wrong and why the right answers are right - you are trying to establish patterns of logic/keywords -&gt; answers.
6. Go through a whole subject area
7. Move to next subject area
8. Complete subject areas
9. Do another (different practice exam)
10. Repeat that whole process

Only when you have done them all ... should you redo them and compare results ... doing this too often leads to memorisation which is bad.

I would also hop on [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) ... its an amazing learning community with study groups and lots of discussions ... by far the best learning community online. There are students of mine and lots of students who've also taken Stephanes stuff.

Hope this helps

g06d908,i2przv,"full disclosure I create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io)

I would seriously consider doing the SA Associate first ...even as a developer the power of AWS comes from understanding the architectural components .. these are after-all what you will be building..with.

The developer cert is also misunderstood since it doesn't really test development ... its more about development tooling and products.. but that doesn't mean its valueless.

Given your aims about wanting to understand how AWS works... I would consider

1. AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate .... base level, architecture, foundational
2. AWS Certified Developer Associate ... adds developer tooling
3. AWS Certified Sysops Administrator Associate ... adds operational... i.e doing.

Assuming you take your time with those 3.. and study to LEARN AWS rather than study to pass a cert - you will be a super hero with your dev skills as well...end to end building. Combine this with architectural knowledge about architectures such as serverless/event-driven and it will be a massive boost to your career.

I created my architect courses first because I genuinely believe they offer the most value. I'm starting to work on my DEV associate and Sysops Associate planning now ... as my #2 prio.

As context, I'm a software eng graduate ... tons of infrastructure experience in AWS, all the AWS certs and I now teach - and for developers I always say 'they have the advantage' .. anyone who knows AWS &amp; Development has a super power. Its SO MUCH easier to learn AWS as a developer , than to learn to code well as an infrastructure engineer.

Hope this helps ... if you want a good community to chill in while learning .. [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) is the place to be :)

Whatever you decide ... the key to passing certs and them actually being useful .. is to study to LEARN the tech, do practical stuff ... the cert is the natural end result.

g06cux7,i2przv,"You need to clarify your goals and need to find a way to fit AWS learning experience as a software developer. If you just want to simply learn about AWS then you can simply watch a crash course/ beginner course on it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to learn AWS as a skill, then I would suggest you start with the AWS Solution Architect Associate Certificate (on the same level as associate developer certificate but more theoretical oriented with the focus on utilizing AWS services to find solutions for problems) as it will give you a foundation to enter the world of AWS. From there you can proceed to associate developer certificate but you might be going to need some working experience for that so utilize AWS free tier (they provide 1-year free access to their certain core services under limits). In this way, you will be familiar with AWS and its core services and then you will more confident while giving an associate developer certificate exam.

1. it's not well regarded by employers - most simply don't know that it exists
2. It's not got the ROI for me for the above reason. It's not THAT much less work than the solutions architect associate - and has a lot less value.
3. In terms of real world knowledge, it's a subset of what a solutions architect should know ... so you shouldn't be studying for it in isolation IMO.

You (and everyone else IMO... even beginners) are much better off studying for the SA Associate using a good course - and gaining the real world knowledge which covers CCP and SA Associate together.

Its why when i made my courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) i skipped CCP and focussed on SAA and SAP as starters ... because I don't feel like it offers even beginners any value.

My course for example covers from beginner onwards and steps you through to being a junior SA .. no need to waste time on CCP in my opinion

* AWS Community Hero
* Creator of the free AWS and Azure Certifications video courses on freeCodeCamp
* AWS and Azure moderator on DEV.to
* Creator and Core Member of the #100DaysOfCloud community project

**Should I obtain either AZ-900 or CCP for an ERP role?**  

Fundementals certifications have value for specific reasons. For developer roles, the CCP and AZ-900 are not valued. However, for grand-strategy thinking and **business management** like an ERP role,  this is one of the few cases where I suggest you obtain both providers at the fundamental levels to have a good understanding of the different offerings.  **IS the AZ-900 or CCP better for a complete beginner?** They are different.   


* The AZ-900 Global Infrastructure is much more complicated than the AWS CCP.
* Azure has technically more cloud services and regions than AWS but I feel it a bit of cheat in terms of marketing since Azure unnecessarily subdivides their services or have cloud regions that are a single AZ.
* AWS in their language, documentation in their practice exams is much more mature and better organized than Azure.

My assessment of the two

* CCP has more content you need to study but the content is easier to digest
* Azure has many quirks and irregularities that make study hard but there is less to study

So you just have to pick your poison. I would say if are looking into ERP  roles I think there are more opportunities in Azure and so I would suggest that AZ-900 first.

  
**Should I skip the fundamentals certifications to an associate-level?**

If you are a complete beginner, I would not suggest skipping fundamental levels. Associates levels such as the AWS Solutions Architect Associate are overwhelming and I have seen a higher success rate to pass when they take the fundamentals.

**Are the fundamentals wasted time to obtain?**

Some hold this sentiment that the CCP is a waste. To compare the SAA-C02 and CLF-C01 (CCP) there is information in the CCP not found in other AWS Certifications. I am surprised when people who hold AWS Pro certifications take the CCP to add to their certification count and they are surprised they had never used or heard of AWS Artifact,  Service Catalog. A huge focus of the CCP is **Management and Governance** and it's just not covered elsewhere. Again this is why I say fundamentals are associated with business management.

**Should I go for the Solutions Architect Associate (SAA)?**

It would be good for your own personal journey. I'd suggest going get the two fundamental certifications CLF-C01 and AZ-900 then choose the cloud you like and get the associate level, and for extra points go for the Security Certification.

g0hc2kw,i29coi,"Hi Andrew, thanks so much for your thorough reply and insights! Sounds like you advise a more broad level understanding of cloud, and studying for the CCP and the AZ-900 before specializing. Especially since the CCP has business management pillars, which would speak to my role as a consultant.

My ultimate goal is to leverage either/both certificates to pivot into Workday Finance for ERP transformation consulting. Since to get certified in WD I have to be sponsored, I figured knowing cloud fundamentals from AWS/Azure helps my case. Then from there can supplement my WD track with AWS/Azure as I grow in the field.

g01lc8b,i22cwu,"it depends on your course /u/duydoe

My SA Associate course teaches for both ... I always see the cloud practitioner knowledge as a subset of the SA Associate - or rather it should be, So i teach it that way.

What /u/anthro28 says below isn't wrong about it being sales and marketing .. but a solutions architect is the bridge between 'sales' what the customer wants or needs, and the tech. So i see it as all one blob.

That said, other instructors split theirs ... (i made a choice not to make a cloud practitioner course and have one which covers that plus SA Associate knowledge).

Honestly.. if you have actually 'learned' AWS to an associate level, you can easily do it.

If you are focussing on narrow 'exam passing' knowledge for the SA Associate then you might struggle.

g018jc9,i21ad2,"(full disclosure I create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) )

/u/crisler92 I tell a story (which is one of my favourite about my students)

Lady, 40+ years old .. didn't really know what AWS was before enrolling on my course.

Had a chat with me first, i promised 1-2-1 help if needed.

She enrolled, worked her a\*\* off ... spending time to actually learn how AWS works inside out (at least at the associate level)

Worked on her exam technique

Aced the Exam

applied for some interviews and leveraged her social network

Got an interview ... mentioned in it that she was a newcomer, but talked about the demos she had done in my courses (things like this , but less complex [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) ) 

She got the job ... they specifically mentioned her honesty, hard work, and practical experience (even if only with demos) as the success points.

My point is ... if you focus on the certs as JUST CERTS ... you won't have much success

If you look at certs as evidence of skills you gain, and you actually work on gaining those skills by learning AWS nobody will care about the lack of a degree, you will get jobs based on your interest and skills in AWS.

.. that lady 3x'd her $$ and works as a junior AWS SA right now. 

There are more stories like that ... if you put in the effort the degree is just one thing you could get, the other is experience and professional certification.

I would suggest just diving in, getting started.

Think about using this community too [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) ... its a great community, almost 7k members, multiple study group channels but also experts talking about AWS all day :)

A fellow cloud journeyer pointed me to your post here so here's my reply.

**How important is a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) to cloud roles?**

In Toronto many of the larger companies in FinTech, MedTech care about BSCs. The reason why is that the hiring managers are Waterloo graduates and they use a BCS as their benchmark for hiring. I know this because I am networked with many of the CTOs in Canada.

Do you need a BSC? No. Does it reduce your hiring opportunities? Yes.

Having a BSC can also ease work visas. At least migration from Canada to US. I know this personally when startups wanted to hire me but it created friction not having a BSC.

I have built candidate screening software used by large tech companies in Canada that would search on keywords in resumes and filter out non-BCS candidates even to go as far as what specific school.

I do feel that BCS is a young person's game. If you're only a few years out of high school I would suggest people go for their BCS, but if you're late to the game, it's not worth going back for BCS.

I skipped a BCS and I regret it, not at first but down the road.

**How important is programming to cloud roles?**

Depends on the role and what you consider programming. Cloud programming I would say is less in-depth than what an application developer would need to know because lots of the work is abstracted away into AWS services. Being comfortable in multiple languages instead of having mastery is an asset.

**How important is AWS Certification?**

Generally its not, it's your own personal journey, and it ticks a box on your resume.

It may put your resume at the top of pile, but that's about it.

I have seen some companies ask for specific certification levels on job applications.

Some companies need to me meet AWS Certification quotas for APN but larger companies have enough candidates.

This is why I recommend getting through the AWS certifications as quickly as possible so you can focus on personal projects. AWS certifications do not equate to practical knowledge.

g015l7z,i21ad2,"No, you don't need a BS. They do help though, of course.

Anyway most people start by doing a few certs, or doing an IT diploma, then starting in an entry-level role and moving up the IT career ladder one job at time, in whatever direction they want to go.

I've heard of kids these days getting Cloud jobs by taking Cloud certs and building out comprehensive cloud portfolios that they show to employers. Maybe that's true, but it just seems like you'd have a lot of knowledge gaps if you take that approach.

This is just me, but I would learn general IT before worrying about Cloud stuff.

Everyone‚Äôs study regime is different and what works for me might not work for you. What will work for everyone though, is having a routine that you can stick to and feel comfortable with. Allocate your daily time, and do your routine. Like I did 1-2h a day and sometimes on the weekend but no really.

In theory, it all sounds good. Trying to split the questions up into different difficulties etc. But I find in practice that‚Äôs just not really practical.

I personally find that‚Äôs over complicating the exam process by a great margin, so I tend to just go through the questions, answer what I can, flag the ones I‚Äôm not sure or are taking me too long and then just revisit those at the end.

That being said, I‚Äôm sure that his method works for him and probably lots of other people too. So I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad or wrong, just that there‚Äôs more than one way to tackle an exam and you just have to find the method that works for you.",3.0

My technique is just something I've started doing over time, its more than just the easy, medium and hard question order.

It's stuff like reading answers before questions to perform 'in isolation' elimination of answers  to reduce cognitive load when tackling the question itself. People always think its crazy, but once they try it ... have fed back it changes things entirely.

Full disclosure i create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) &amp; It's also one of my 'things' to help people career switch -  i have a load of students going through who've never touched AWS before.

First... i would NOT do the AWS Sysops first.

You should always focus on one cloud first .. and that should be AWS (biggest, best, more innovative) and you should start with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate. Its architecture, stuff you need as support for everything else and it covers a broad range of services so will be a nice introduction.

So don't do Sysops, forget Azure and forget google short term.

I would look at AWS Architect Associate, Then Sysops Associate.

Focus on getting training geared at teaching you to BE the role you are going for - not just passing an exam... certs on their own are useless.

I'd also suggest joining a good community .... [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com) is my recommendation.

if you do go the architect route ... some links which will help

Sysops shares a lot of the product coverage with Associate SA .. but with a doing , rather than an architecting perspective.

Dev is different now... still has some, but not a massive amount of overlap.

It's more dependant on what content you used to learn... my SAA-C02 course for instance covers a LOT of the doing side and so students are telling me 60-70% coverage of the sysops (depending on who i ask) - ive even had some suggest a lower but still decent number for dev overlap.

fztcetn,i0xwrq,"/u/unspokened i would consider it yes. There are three things in play here

1. Are you studying to pass the exam, or to learn AWS ?
2. is it your AWS skills which are lacking, or
3. is it your exam skills.

Any of those 3 can be a problem. Now full disclosure I create AWS courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) but im not trying to sell anything here, i mention it only because I will be referring to things about my content to help.

1st thing ... In my courses I try and teach people how to BE a SA... i.e learning real skills... and that means ideally when facing exam questions they have the skills required to be able to work aspects of the question out. AWS do try and involve the real world in the SAA-C02 exam questions - so you can gain a lot from some experience.

I want to provide a few links which i think might help you work out where your skills are

This is something I wrote [https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html](https://cantrill.io/2020/05/24/Passing-the-AWS-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-certification.html)

and this is a set of notes one of my students wrote [https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course](https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course)

Check both of those.. and see where you think you sit. If its your AWS skills which are lacking, thats ok, that just suggests more work is needed.

However, if you are comfy with AWS.. then its your exam technique.

If so ... the exam and question technique videos at the end of my SAA-C02 course are free, have a look at them [https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02)

When you are doing practice tests try this approach

Whatever the result, for any wrong questions... collect the questions, and the right and wrong answers up.

Group them into subject areas - compute, storage, networking and so on.

Pick one area.

Then... for each question in that area, assume you know NOTHING ... and challenge yourself to prove or disprove the answers, why was your answer wrong, why are the right ones right.

Assume nothing and try and identify WHAT in the question could have been the clue and what  keywords or architecture principles might have helped you.

Repeat that for all the subject areas

Do the practice test again, see how you do.

Exams are a different set of skills from knowing AWS and its essential to target your efforts.

fzpqhut,i0hsrl,"a few things /u/balajikaliappan

1) the practice tests are trash .. really really bad, so i don't put much faith in the results on the official ones.

2) As /u/FoxJoshua said, the danger is you are memorising answers to a certain test, which is really bad .. bad that its not an accurate representation and bad that it gives you a false sense of progress.

My usual suggestion is to 

1) do a practice exam

2) for ALL the wrong answers... group them together into product areas (Compute, Storage, Networking etc)

3) pick one ... 

4) Assume nothing, and for every question you got wrong .... even if you think it was a stupid mis answer, review the answers you selected and challenge yourself to explain why your answer is wrong .... and why the right answer is right ... you have to reestablish the patterns and key word analysis

5) Do one question subject area at a time

6) Repeat.

Your bad score on the practice exam might be the anomaly here, NOT your normal progress... so you might be ok... i think at this stage the best way is to just book it, and do it.

g8pbp7o,jadqxl,"Have you actually looked at a good video instruction for aws? Like Maerek's course.

I think the alternative is white papers and documentation on aws website. But the issue you'll run into is the amount of text you will need to go through. Each whitepaper is at least 100 pages and sometimes few hundred pages. Its not the most efficient way and its time consuming. 
I felt doing a good training video was much better use of time. I did cloud academy and Maerek's and they both were really good at making the point across in just 15-30 minutes and goes into lot of depth. 

I think there is a shortage of high quality, condensed text material that is in depth and technical. Something that we can look at and read and understand the concept. Instead the whitepapers are very wordy, not a quick read at all.

g8o938m,ja8mua,"It's an I3.large instance - it already has instance store (0.475 TB NVMe SSD)

The question talks about it being a temporary database (meaning nothing with persistence requirements) so instance store is safe to use.

It would be more clicks to do the EBS volumes, since you have to create it &amp; attach it, and provide a more expensive solution given the requirements (the instance store is included in the price)

The other consideration is IO1's 50:1 max IOPS/SIZE ratio, meaning a 50GB volume (as indicated in the answer) offers a max of 2500 IOPS, the question requires 3000

Assuming the answer marked as correct is the one in green, i agree.

One comment I see , is that CCP + 50% off voucher + SAA is not much more expensive than just SAA on its own ... which is true. And it's good practice .. which I can see the logic in.

I got my CCP about this time last year. And at that time, I had zero experience with AWS. My company was dipping its toes into it and I wanted to get a better understanding of what AWS offers and what it all can do.

The studying was great, and I felt I learned a lot at what they offered. One annoying thing was there were multiple questions that would quiz you on your knowledge of their support tiers (this one, you get a response in an hour vs 24 hours, etc.). But I suppose it has merit.

I'm currently studying for the SAA, and that's after I've had some experience with AWS.

I took a one-day class for CCP and I felt like a fish out of water, but that's because it's my first entry into AWS.

When I took the three-day course for SAA, I understood everything the instructor was going over and then truly appreciated the in-depth discussions on the numerous topics. 

To mirror what others have said, if you want a good high-level knowledge of what AWS offers, the CCP is the right choice. If you intend to take the SAA, you may want to hold off from the CCP and pursue the SAA. However, if you have no experience working with AWS, then pursuing the SAA will be more difficult.

You have two types of instances ... one which is twice the size, but previous gen (so objectively not twice the performance, but thats just tiny detail).

Since the question says ELB .. which in this context can mean CLB or ALB.. you don't know you have the ALB functionality needed for this, so it excludes itself.

Never assume ELB = ALB... ELB = Family, CLB = Classic, NLB = Network, ALB = Application. There are many features supported on the v2's so NLB and ALB which aren't supported on CLB (so not on the vaguer ELB term)",2.0

g8krhio,j9n438,"hey /u/Jersey86Devil

So I'm going to start this with a disclosure, i create courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io/) but I want to make my suggestions below neutral.

The first step, is to reframe this a little - don't think about this as 'getting certifications' think about it as learning the AWS products, services, architectures and implementation details and passing the certification as a result.

It's possible to break into the industry with no skills and experience, I have a growing list of students who've shifted careers from non IT into working in AWS - it just takes time and effort.  I've helped librarians change career, firefighters, lawyers, hospitality staff - anyone can do it.

The first step is picking a path.

**Certifications**

The first step is to understand the certifications, abstract away from any particular course for a second. AWS offers a few different types and levels of certifications

Overall, the certs are split between ROLE based certs and SPECIALITY based certs. Forget the specialities for a second, they come later.

In the ROLE based certs, you have a few levels.

Practitioner

Associate

Professional

I'm not a fan of the practitioner certification, It's not really known/regarded by employers and IMO its not efficient to study in isolation since there is a massive overlap with the Associate level. So regardless of existing skill level, i would skip past this.

In my opinion, 99% of people should start at the associate level, and there are 3 streams here, architect, developer and sysops administrator.

Almost everyone should start with Solutions Architect Associate - it's foundational, it covers the architecture and integration methods of all of the core AWS services so IMO it makes an ideal starting point.

From that point, you have choices ... you can either cover the other associates then move to the professional level, or move straight to Solutions Architect Professional.. (thats a big decision)

I wouldn't suggest moving to the speciality certs (which cover areas you are specifically interested in) until you have the SA Associate and SA Pro.

**Courses And Content**

Courses are either focussed on passing the exam or focussed on teaching real skills &amp; passing the exam. The former are generally shorter and cheaper, they get you the exam, but have questionable long term value. The latter are longer, more expensive, get you the cert but also teach real skills. Courses have a variable amount of practical content - this is harder to produce so many of the cheaper courses have less.

If you want to gain real skills and get a job working with AWS, specifically if you have no experience then you should focus on real skills focussed courses.

Courses are either subscription or one time enrollment (and keep in mind for the latter, some impose a 1 year limited access on it).

(starting to talk about my stuff here - warning!!)

I suggest the following

1. Start studying for SA Associate.. IMO its the best place to start
2. Join a community i suggest [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com/) \- you will learn and improve by just being around other people doing the same thing.
3. Use real AWS accounts not restricted sandboxes
4. Demos Demos Demos - these teach practical skills i maintain a free demos repo [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs)
5. If you do the SA Associate here are some notes which might help

g8le2bq,j9n438,Wow - amazing response . I can attest I just got my solutions architect associate last week and still bought the associate and pro version from Cantrill.io and its already blowing away what I experienced buying a cloud guru course from Udemy and many courses I viewed on Skillsoft . Great resource too on the slack channel,3.0
g8le0qe,j9n438,"It is doable but you have to really want it. Learning AWS and passing the certification tests is hard enough, but without experience it is hard to find a job. I have no IT experience but I started learning AWS about 6 months ago and passed a bunch of certifications, including the SA-pro. I am now trying to find a job working with AWS and I am finding it very difficult. Recruiters are constantly emailing me with available positions, but when I respond and see I have no prior experience my certs mean nothing. I have had some luck, I am going for my 3rd interview at a company today but it is only after I have applied for every IT/cloud position I see posted. 

This can be done. Just know that without experience, getting certified will only be half the battle. If this is an idea you have that you think sounds cool and you just want to devote a little free time here and there, you may not succeed. If you want it more than anything else in the world and you are willing to really put in the work, you can make it happen. 

There are a ton of people in this sub that will give discouraging words and tell you that it either can't be done, or that you need to start as a janitor at a tech company and work your way up. Don't listen to them. If you are willing to sacrifice and work hard, then you can do this. Just don't let yourself think it will be easy. 

I hope that helps you.",5.0

It's very hard to search for such an organization since everyone has certs nowadays. So, I would recommend startups and even boosting resume with 1-2 points related to AWS if no luck at all.

Hands on labs are great to get that real world hands on experience but you can also build in your own AWS account.

g8mwxf7,j9n438,"This is Andrew Brown. AWS Community Hero.

On average it takes 3 years to break into any of the three industries (Web, Mobile, Cloud). For web, if you just stick it out another year, I think you would haven broken in.

The number of people applying can be discouraging, but it doesn't really matter, since there are so many low quality candidates,  90% are filtered out so you're really competing with a smaller pool.

You don't need past-work experience at a company. You need to prove that you can do the work. The best way is to pour your energy into a single project and treat it like a real product or service. I see lots of project portfolios but they toy apps, so you have no sense that the person can handle real workloads.

The challenge with a career in cloud is that roles are not well defined. Cloud Engineer, Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineers are loosely defined so its hard to understand the expectations of the role without deep investigating into the company you are applying to.

Junior cloud roles for pure cloud roles are far and few. Mostly people are getting into cloud roles because they are transitioning from a previous roles like Web-application development and then adding cloud skills.

If you're getting AWS Certified with no past experience then you may as well get the most in-expensive AWS Certification such as the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) commonly known as the CCP.  

There are two kinds of employers for cloud:  

1. Companies that have a strong focus on cloud, they are generally part of the Amazon Partner Network (APN)  eg. DataDog, SignalFX
2. Companies that use cloud because they have to host this applications somewhere, but their knowledge of AWS Certification is limited

The first is going to be too hard for you to break into, you're going to be going after the second. To them the CCP looks as good as an associate. So if you just want to fulfill that certification checkbox just get the CCP.

In the #100DaysOfCloud discord which I think now have over 1000 members. The goal of our community is connect you with other people trying to break into the industry,

[https://discord.gg/dW2XRcF](https://discord.gg/dW2XRcF)",0.0
g8oe0d8,j9n438,"I have to disagree with the advice here. Even companies who use cloud need someone who knows their way around AWS that can can solve real problems. With the CCP, you might know what a service is for and not much else. There's Google for that. Nobody will hire you with just a CCP. CCP can't be compared to the SA Associate, they are miles apart. 

But, even with SAA, you will need to understand other technologies and you should have a portfolio of projects using various technologies together that shows an understanding of how to piece things together to solve a problem. Look at job postings and find out what other technologies companies are looking for. With the CCP, you won't even make it past a recruiter or interview, if you get that far. Remember, the point is not to get a job, but to do the work as part of the job. If you just get a CCP and stop there, you're wasting your time. You will not be in a position to be an asset to a company with that. They would rather bring in an intern at no cost.

Start a blog and talk about what you're working on, get on Twitter and link to your posts, engage in dialog, network, put yourself in front of people and show you have some knowledge. Message people in roles or companies where you want to be. People are willing to mentor or at least be a contact. Not everyone will bother to help you, but that's ok. Keep reaching out till you make some head way. Maybe, someone will recognise your effort and knowledge, or you can just ask your network to help you put a word in. It's doable, but it will take time. Also, look local, don't start looking to work for a mid to large company. See if you can contribute to a local company. Join your local meetup group, that's a great way to network with employees of local companies. If you're looking for a devops role, get involved in an open source project and build your GitHub profile.

Without experience, you're going to need a good network to help vouch for you and a good portfolio of projects. Companies give their employees opportunities to look for new candidates, so make use of that. People who know how hard you're working to get a chance will put a word in for you. The tech industry hires people from all kinds of backgrounds, so it's really about putting in the work to make yourself be noticed.

My advice, skip the CCP, your time is better spent on SAA and above.",1.0

g8du3dy,j8t60p,"Hi /u/Wormy21

So I'm going to start this with a disclosure, i create courses at [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) but I want to make my suggestions below neutral.

**Certifications**

The first step is to understand the certifications, abstract away from any particular course for a second. AWS offers a few different types and levels of certifications

Overall, the certs are split between ROLE based certs and SPECIALITY based certs. Forget the specialities for a second, they come later.

In the ROLE based certs, you have a few levels.

Practitioner

Associate

Professional

I'm not a fan of the practitioner certification, It's not really known/regarded by employers and IMO its not efficient to study in isolation since there is a massive overlap with the Associate level. So regardless of existing skill level, i would skip past this.

In my opinion, 99% of people should start at the associate level, and there are 3 streams here, architect, developer and sysops administrator.

Almost everyone should start with Solutions Architect Associate - it's foundational, it covers the architecture and integration methods of all of the core AWS services so IMO it makes an ideal starting point. 

From that point, you have choices ... you can either cover the other associates then move to the professional level, or move straight to Solutions Architect Professional.. (thats a big decision)

I wouldn't suggest moving to the speciality certs (which cover areas you are specifically interested in) until you have the SA Associate and SA Pro.

**Courses And Content**

As you have found out the space is full of lots of courses, some long, some short, some expensive some cheap, some on udemy, some on the vendors own sites. Without talking specifically about my content there are a few things to keep in mind

Courses are either focussed on passing the exam or focussed on teaching real skills &amp; passing the exam. The former are generally shorter and cheaper, they get you the exam, but have questionable long term value. The latter are longer, more expensive, get you the cert but also teach real skills.

Courses have a variable amount of practical content - this is harder to produce so many of the cheaper courses have less.

Courses are either subscription or one time enrollment (and keep in mind for the latter, some impose a 1 year limited access on it).

(starting to talk about my stuff here - warning!!)

I suggest the following

1. Start studying for SA Associate.. IMO its the best place to start
2. Join a community i suggest [https://techstudyslack.com](https://techstudyslack.com)
3. Use real AWS accounts not restricted sandboxes
4. Demos Demos Demos - these teach practical skills i maintain a free demos repo [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs)
5. If you do the SA Associate here are some notes which might help

g8e2ssx,j8t60p,"Not sure what your background is, if you are in IT and looking to just pass the exam or really learn aws.


/u/acantril has already given you some solid advice. So in a nutshell start exploring the solutions architect associate. This is the basis/foundation for everything else. After doing this you will get a very good understanding and appreciation for the rest. From there you can then make a decision on advanced/specialty streams.


I bought the popular courses on udemy and /u/acantril's courses. They serve different purposes. 


If you wanna spend an hour or two a day for a few weeks understanding and absorbing aws. I'd recommend Adrian's course.",2.0
g8e0r4p,j8t60p,"Hi /u/Wormy21

I feel slightly different from /u/acantril in that I think AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) is a great place to start if you just truly have no idea wtf is going on in AWS and you're not sure if you want to pursue this knowledge more seriously. One thing I've seen a lot of people in IT do is shell out a lot of money for courses and bootcamps only to realize a few weeks/months into it that they have no interest in pursuing it further. In this regard, A Cloud Guru's CCP course is a great way to just get your feet wet without making a huge commitment. The course is only 7 hours long and covers just the high level concepts. In the worst-case scenario you've spent 1 month on ACG subscription and wasted only 7 hours of your time to learn that it's not for you. If you decide to sit for the CCP test (which I highly recommend) you also get a feel for what the standardized testing experience is like if you haven't done something like it in a long time.

Keep in mind that like /u/acantril advised, CCP won't really help you on your resume or in your job prospects but if you finish the 7 hour course and you're like ""hell yeah I want to know more about all of this"" then waste no time and cancel your A Cloud Guru membership and RUN (don't walk) over to [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) and sign up for the Solutions Architect - Associate course.

g8dfe2r,j8s6dm,"/u/vanillacap yeah so warm standby would be running reduced size versions of things

Pilot light would be running core infrastructure, replicating data in, and then switching stuff on as needed.

&gt;**Pilot light.** The idea of the pilot light is an analogy that comes from gas heating. In that scenario, a small flame that‚Äôs always on can quickly ignite the entire furnace to heat up a house. In this DR approach, you simply replicate part of your IT structure for a limited set of core services so that the AWS cloud environment seamlessly takes over in the event of a disaster. A small part of your infrastructure is always running simultaneously syncing mutable data (as databases or documents), while other parts of your infrastructure are switched off and used only during testing. Unlike a backup and recovery approach, you must ensure that your most critical core elements are already configured and running in AWS (the pilot light). When the time comes for recovery, you can rapidly provision a full-scale production environment around the critical core.

The wording is a little vague though which means there is a chance it could be warm standby.

&gt;The term warm standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud. A warm standby solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation. It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running. By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on.

But Pilot light makes more sense as the correct answer. With pilot light you would have your DB's replicated in, maybe your domain controllers replicating in. Other services would be migrated in, but shutdown ready to be powered on.

The problem with the question is I dont think it provides any 'clear' keywords which can push the recommended answer from Pilot Light towards Warm Standby i.e.

&gt;in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud.

g89rgyu,j874hm,"If you don't already have IT experience, it will be difficult to land a Cloud role as your very first position. An MS looks good on your resume and will probably get you some interviews, but in the end, hiring managers for Cloud-related roles generally want candidates with a broad IT background. 

This is because the Cloud is less of a thing on its own, and more of a combination of multiple technologies that have been developing over the decades. So if you don't understand and have experience with the technologies that underly the Cloud, you will be at a severe disadvantage to those who do.

You could always start with a generalist position, build your experience, and then look at specializing later on. Network engineering might be another area to look into, but again, these positions typically require experience. Another thing to keep in mind is that the market is very tight right now; things will get better after COVID and we return to some degree of normalcy.",3.0

what gateways do what

what gateways are AZ and region resilient.

I'm one of the training architects working on the A Cloud Guru exam prep course for this exam! I am sharing the course creation with the super knowledgeable u/John_ACloudGuru

Many of the topics can be similar to those on the retired Big Data Specialty exam, so be sure and read FAQ's for the topics on the Big Data exam. As well as check out the courses on Big Data on LA and ACG.

Some of the key services for this exam are S3, Redshift, Glue, EMR, Elasticsearch, Kinesis, and Quicksight with a sprinkling of a few other services. It's vital to understand these services, and how they interact with one another.

John and I are working hard to deliver our course as soon as we can, and it should be available later this year. Very soon actually!

g7yj977,j6ermb,"In almost all cases, Amazon SQS long polling is preferable to short polling. Long-polling requests let your queue consumers receive messages as soon as they arrive in your queue while reducing the number of empty ReceiveMessageResponse instances returned.

Amazon SQS long polling results in higher performance at reduced cost in the majority of use cases. However, if your application expects an immediate response from a ReceiveMessage call, you might not be able to take advantage of long polling without some modifications to your application.

For example, if your application uses a single thread to poll multiple queues, switching from short polling to long polling will probably not work, because the single thread will wait for the long-poll timeout on any empty queues, delaying the processing of any queues that might contain messages.

In such an application, it is a good practice to use a single thread to process only one queue, allowing the application to take advantage of the benefits that Amazon SQS long polling provides.

g7zzosz,j6ermb,Hot take. This is because while SQS long polling hits all possible SQS servers short polling only selects a random subset of those servers per poll. I assume they designed it this way to limit the number of requests on servers. You'll still get the messages missing because you'll be polling again soon after. This happens so fast you likely won't notice it as an issue. As others have stated though the direct answer is you do want to be using long polling where possible. Also if your message queue isn't that big you may not miss messages with short polling at all as obviously you're using less servers.,2.0

The question asks for the situation where

1. The company must manage the encryption keys themselves
2. use Amazon S3 to perform the encryption.

There are 4 types of encryption

1. Client Side - you encrypt the object, and then upload to S3. You handle keys, and you handle encryption process. S3 is not involved in any way, it simply stores encrypted data. This is NOT correct for this question because YOU encrypt and NOT S3.
2. SSE-C - you manage keys, provide key and object to S3 and it encrypts for you (SSE-C is server side encryption, client managed keys) this is what answer D is, the correct answer
3. SSE-S3 - S3 manages keys and encryption.. you supply object, its encrypted. This is NOT correct, because S3 handles keys NOT you.
4. SSE-KMS as above, but with extra features. This is NOT correct, because S3 handles keys NOT you.

The correct answer is D... no doubt what so ever

D = SSE-C which is correct.

A Cannot be correct because bucket default encryption only works with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS (S3 manages keys, and does encryption). 

SSE-C (server side encryption with client managed keys ) and Client Side Encryption are NOT supported with bucket default encryption.

B is wrong ... because asymmetric key

C is wrong ... because asymmetric key

g7vsosb,j61za6,"You are wrong /u/iforgettedit .. the detail here matters.

Client side encryption is where you handle the encryption and decryption process, either directly or using SDK AND You manage the keys. Here you encrypt before sending.

SSE-C is where S3 as a service handles encryption and decryption, but where you provide and manage the keys. Here you provide the object and the key, and S3 encrypts it for you.

====

Client Side ... you manage keys, you encrypt and decrypt and then send to S3 encrypted.

SSE-C .. you manage keys, give the object and the key to S3 and it handles the encryption process.

SSE-S3 you provide the object... S3 handles encryption and the keys

SSE-KMS as above, but where you can customise the CMK used and use role separation.

The answer is D... because the question says you manage the keys and S3 does the encryption process.",1.0
