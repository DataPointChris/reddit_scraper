gw3irz,[C#] Fast ToString() Implementortion,"Hi! Senior architect at Performance Code Haus, GMBH here. As a community of computer scientists, we need to be stringently concerned, at all times, with creating highly-optimized code source. PCH GMBH's goal is to provide the air-tight, high-perf performance code our customers have come to expect from us. For our most recent project, this required we re-implement `ToString()` in a way that provided much of the same functionality, but with near 0 performance impact.

&amp;nbsp;

A little more background:
For the past 2 years, we have been moving our server-side codebase to C# .NET 6.0. The sad reality is that the procedures in our server's `Program` object must constantly interop with our VB 5.0/VBA client platforms. The more experienced among you will recognize this comes at significant, unavoidable costs.

&amp;nbsp;

Initially, our intern teams struggled finding realistic solutions to improve performance. Despite their insistences, there unfortunately just isn't enough summer to accomplish tasks such as refactoring `Main()`, ensuring existing code follows SOLID principles, or adding comments where needed. 

&amp;nbsp;

It took until our company's annual autumnal post-mort for our seniors &amp; leads to identify realistic avenues for success. What we needed was to switch gears. What we needed was the kind of out-of-the-box thinking optimizations demand. What we needed was the ruthless identification &amp; elimination of micro-bottlenecks.

&amp;nbsp;

# Object.ToString(): The Biggest of Micro-Bottlenecks

After several weeks of research, we discovered one of the most significant micro-bottlenecks was firing the `Object.ToString()` procedure. (The more familiar with C# among you may know this already. But most of our developers come from the move-fast world of JavaScript and simply aren't used to blackbox performance hogs). For nearly every string of text, raising `ToLog()`, `ToConsole()`, `ToEmail()`, `ToGroupMessage()` etc. each necessitated costly firing of an accompanying `ToString()`.

**NOTE:** We have yet to hear back from Microsoft on `Object.ToString()` performance issues, despite our repeated efforts to contact the company.

&amp;nbsp;

Our engineers ensure me that the re-implementation we developed is, for all intents &amp; purposes, a perfect fit for our needs. We unfortunately can't show you all of our code; there are just too many files to do so. But we can give you an illustration that you can copy-&amp;-paste and build upon.

fjiby6,Help with nested dictionaries (I think) Need help pulling out specific value (have done google searching to no avail)," 

Ok, so i‚Äôm using an api that returns a dictionary that looks something like this:

`random = {'random': 332, 'Id': 11, 'Mode': 'CLASSIC', 'Type': 'CUSTOM', 'participants': [{'Id': 100, 'Id': 14, '2Id': 4, 'cId': 1, 'IconId': 4245, 'Name': 'agaming83', 'bot': False, 'sId': 'F0IWXeoB', 'gCustomObjects': [], 'perks': {'perkIds': [8351, 8304, 8345, 8347, 8014, 9104, 5008, 5008, 5002], 'pStyle': 8300, 'pSubStyle': 8000}}], 'observers': {'encryptionKey': 'HNI11xmLmb6p+o2uDNKE/oFJffZDNDvb'}, 'formId': 'A1', 'bChamp': [], 'StartTime': 0, 'Length': 0}`

I want to get the Name agaming83 from this dict. I have tried things like:

`Print(random['participants']['Name'])`

or something like this

`for key, value in random.items() :`

   `print(key, value)`

and nothing extracts the s pecific thing I want (the value agaming83). Any help would be awesome.

I am able to do something like this:

`random2 = test[‚Äòparticipants‚Äô]print(random2)`

and am able to get a everything from the participants key, but I want to get just the specific value of agaming83 from the dict

If I made something confusing let me know and i‚Äôll clarify

emqk1i,I think this is the place to share my story; The dirtiest hack I've ever done,"I got a task at work to do, what basically amounts to copying a id-number, pasting it into a form on a website and clicking enter. As there was over a thousand ids, I figured I'd make a script.

Now, my first instinct was python, but I wasn't able to install it on my work laptop and my boss wasn't there at the moment so that was off the table. I instead opted for a vbscript that copied each number from a text file, pressed tab eight times, pasted it in and pressed enter.

This worked great, however, even though I placed  delay of a few seconds ever iteration, sometimes the site would lag for almost half a minute and my script would be out-of-sync.

I figured out how the form was processed by inspecting the HTML, and after digging a bit I managed to write a little javascript to send a POST request to the right place with the correct parameters; The only problem with this approach is that there's no way to read data from a local file through the chrome console (that I could find).

Consequently, my final (and working) approach became this: I created a vbscript that parses the ids from a textfile and creates a javascript array where every line in the text file corresponds to an element in the array. I then print that, along with a javascript script that iterates over the array and sends a POST request for every element. The response for every request is the entire page in HTML, but with an added error box, so to check for this, I have to parse the returned HTML to see if this box exists or not.

In short, I created a vbscript that generates a js script, that I can then paste into the chrome console, esentially just to enter a few numbers into a box and press enter. I felt very resourceful doing this, but I have never felt so proud yet disgusted at the same time in my life. I hope to never again find myself in a situation where a hack such as this is required.",140,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13
ekt42i,reading data from CSV or XLS file to HTML [question],"Hi,

I need to build a website that acts and looks like a mainframe

it's supposed to act like this:

1. on the main page there is a text input, the user needs to write a client ID
2. the system then needs to take the input and search for a .csv or .xls file with the same name
3. when redirected to different pages, the data from the file needs to be implemented to the right places on the site

is it possible? using Javasript and Jquery?

e48sy4,Question about a logic problem:,"Hey all, so I have the following logic problem for school:

&gt;Given three ints, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large.


&gt;evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) ‚Üí true

&gt;evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) ‚Üí true

&gt;evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) ‚Üí false

Now, I know that when programming, it's always best to make sure you condense everything into as few lines as possible. I think I've gotten the solution optimized fully as it is only one command, but could someone tell me how to better it? Here's my code:


    public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a &gt; b &amp;&amp; b &gt; c ? a - b == b - c : (a &gt; c &amp;&amp; c &gt; b ? a - c == c - b : (b &gt; c &amp;&amp; c &gt; a ? b - c == c - a : (b &gt; a &amp;&amp; a &gt; c ? b - a == a - c : (c &gt; b &amp;&amp; b &gt; a ? c - b == b - a : (c &gt; a &amp;&amp; a &gt; b ? c - a == a - b : a == b &amp;&amp; b == c)))));

d897ve,What is a Microsoft .NET Framework?,"I'm making a few macros here for a client in my lab, and while I am fair at generating time saving tools, my limited knowledge is based off of VBA and the sendkey function, which doesn't require editing any client.  Since my tools saved an substantial amount of time, I've been requested to edit and create macros within the client's project in order to create more effective scripts and commands.  C sharp isn't the issue, rather, it's an old client from 2009, and tmk the company doesn't support it anymore because they were bought out by another.  The client doesn't open in my Visual Studio 2017 because ""Install Missing Features"", but it seems to open in someone else's VS2012.  After comparing what programs we've installed, namely the Microsoft .NET Frameworks, we found we both had 1.1, but I was missing, 4.5 Multi-Targeting Pack, 4.5 SDK, 4.6.1 (Duestch), and 4.7.   I'm about to collect them all, but coming from VBA, I'm unsure what these are.

Could someone shed light for this noob on what these are and why it's so important to collect them all?  Also, why weren't all the .NET Frameworks not preinstalled with the OS/IDE if it's so integral to opening up software or clients?  Also, if its not too esoteric, why was 1.2 - 4.4 unneeded?

d23quc,Deconstructing and reconstructing the awful code from a simple color slider,"#[**pastebin of code discussed from PoseModeScript.cs**](https://pastebin.com/F0UMAEur)  
You must read this before continuing.

**What's wrong with this.**

Line 1, the extremely long else if  

    else if (Input.GetAxis(""Horizontal"") &gt; 0.5f || Input.GetAxis(""Horizontal"") &lt; -0.5f || Input.GetAxis(""DpadX"") &gt; 0.5f || Input.GetAxis(""DpadX"") &lt; -0.5f || Input.GetKey(KeyCode.RightArrow) || Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftArrow))
   
This is very strange because it makes 6 different checks for user input and if any of them are true it does many of the same checks again in the CalculateValue function, this time returning -1 or 1 depending on whether the input is left or right. If the function had a return for ""no input"" its return value could simply be used as the condition, avoiding checking inputs twice

In CapColors
1. The R,G,B components for two materials are checked twice, even when unnecessary.  
	If any of the Color's components are less than 0f it is assigned 0f.  
	The same component is later checked again to see if the component is greater than 1f, which is impossible if it was assigned 0f.  
	
It may be unnecessary to get the entire material when assigning new Colors. I'm unsure of the performance implications but assigning a modified Color as opposed to the entire material sounds better.

The function calling CapColors is also a mess.  
It calls CapColors which, in a very verbose manner clamps every color component despite only one being modified, and reassigns both the hair and eye colors despite it only being possible to modify one at a time.  
This entire function wouldn't even be necessary if the single color component being changed was clamped when calculated

Enumerating ""this.Selected"" would make this code so much easier to understand. It might read

    else if (this.Selected == HairHueSlider_R)  

instead of  

    else if (this.Selected == 5)

And this.Value needs a more descriptive name. It's -1 if userinput is left and 1 if right. There's so many better names for this.
 
---
 
Let's make this slightly better

    //new function

    Color addToColor(Color colr, int component, float value){ //adds float Value to specified component of Color and returns Color
    	colr[component] = Mathf.Clamp(colr[component]+value, 0.0f, 1.0f);
    	return colr;
    }
    
    else 
    xAxisInput = CalculateValue();
    if(xAxisInput != 0)
    {
    	float addme = (float)this.Degree*0.003921569f*(float)xAxisInput;
    	if (this.Selected &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; this.Selected &lt;= 6){
    		selectedComponent = (int)this.Selected%4;
			Color newColor = addToColor(this.Student.Cosmetic.HairRenderer.material.color, selectedComponent, addme)
			this.Student.Cosmetic.HairRenderer.material.color = newColor
    	}
    	else if (this.Selected &gt;= 7 &amp;&amp; this.Selected &lt;= 9){
    		selectedComponent = (int)this.Selected%7;
			Color newColor = addToColor(this.Student.Cosmetic.RightEyeRenderer.material.color, selectedComponent, addme)
    		this.Student.Cosmetic.LeftEyeRenderer.material.color = newColor;
    		this.Student.Cosmetic.RightEyeRenderer.material.color = newColor;
    	}
    	this.UpdateLabels();
    }
    
    //CapColors Removed because it's useless.

**A breakdown of the flow of code in the original script and my new script**

**Before:**   
Situation: Left key input, changing eyeColor's blue component

    Check if Left or right is input and if so do the following...
    Check if Left key input again in CalculateValue 

    Get Hair material
    Get rightEye material  
    Check if hairColor_Red slider selected
    Check if hairColor_Green slider selected
    Check if hairColor_Blue slider selected
    Check if eyeColor_Red slider selected
    Check if eyeColor_Green slider selected
    Check if eyeColor_Blue slider selected
    Since eyeColor_Blue is selected, assign rightEye material newly constructed color with blue value possibly outside range accepted valued 0f to 1f
    
	Enter CapColor function
    If hairColor's red is less than 0, assign newly constructed color with red equal to 0f to hairMaterial
    If hairColor's blue is less than 0, assign newly constructed color with green equal to 0f to hairMaterial
    If hairColor's green is less than 0, assign newly constructed color with blue equal to 0f to hairMaterial
    If hairColor's red is greater than 1, assign newly constructed color with red equal to 1f to hairMaterial
    If hairColor's blue is greater than 1, assign newly constructed color with green equal to 1f to hairMaterial
    If hairColor's green greater than 1, assign newly constructed color with blue equal to 1f to hairMaterial

    //do the following even though it is completely unnecessary given since the eye color was not modified
    If righteyeColor's red is less than 0, assign newly constructed color with red equal to 0f to righteyeColor
    If righteyeColor's blue is less than 0, assign newly constructed color with green equal to 0f to righteyeColor
    If righteyeColor's green is less than 0, assign newly constructed color with blue equal to 0f to righteyeColor
    If righteyeColor's red is greater than 1, assign newly constructed color with red equal to 1f to righteyeColor
    If righteyeColor's blue is greater than 1, assign newly constructed color with green equal to 1f to righteyeColor
    If righteyeColor's green greater than 1, assign newly constructed color with blue equal to 1f to righteyeColor
    assign righteyeColor to lefteyeColor

---

**After:**   
Situation: Left input, changing eyeColor's blue component

    Check Left or right
    If Left or right do the following
    Check if a hairColor changer is selected, it's not so do nothing
    Check if an eyeColor changer is selected, since it is, do following....
    Get Color of righteyeColor
    modify the Color, adding value from slider to blue component while clamping to accepted range.
    Assign modified Color back to rightEye Color
    Assign modified Color back to leftEye Color

---

And the way the Colors are printed. That's bugged too. The 0.0 to 1.0 color component floats are multiplied by 255 to give their 0 to 255 representation. That's fine.  
But due to the nature of floats some digits will wind up with stray decimals like "".00001"" appended to them. That's also fine.  
What isn't fine is that the floats aren't printed with a string formatting option that prevents the erroneous decimals from being printed.  
[Video of the bug show at 6:45 in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OX5jQo1d6U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=408) I would strongly suggest you mute the video.

The bug, which has been in the game for 3 years can be fixed in a matter of seconds. Simply put argument ""N0"" (number with 0 decimals) in the ToString() function.  

Before

    this.OptionLabels[4].text = ""Hair R: "" + (this.Student.Cosmetic.HairRenderer.material.color.r * 255f).ToString();
	
After

    this.OptionLabels[4].text = ""Hair R: "" + (this.Student.Cosmetic.HairRenderer.material.color.r * 255f).ToString(""N0"");
    
---
	
The above code (besides the ToString fix) hasn't been tested but there's no reason it shouldn't work. Maybe there's a few minor issues with syntax. It's not great because it's based on Yandere Simulator but still, theoretically, is better performing. Not that this small segment of code has a massive impact on the performance of the game overall.",3,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13

bz1tz4,A Deep Dive Into Obfuscationization Techniques v2,"Pretend you're tasked with designing a web servicer that works with sensitive information, for example IAM (Individual Account Mastering). You might create a method function thing named `AuthenticateUserUsingDefaultKey8801AFGK7223KXWY_DO_NOT_CALL_INTERNAL_USE_ONLY()`; quite obviously you wouldn't want this publicly discovermented. You might think  you can hide your most intensely private area by compilering your code into a managered DLL (or 'dell'). 

&amp;nbsp;

But did you know your code can be *DE*compilered?

&amp;nbsp;

## **Decompilering: It Is What?**

Decompilering is a technique hackers developed to steal your [~~precious bodily fluids~~](https://youtu.be/N1KvgtEnABY) code. Various decompilering tools exist, but they all serve a single purpose: to make the beeps &amp; boops readamentable. Code written in **any language** is susceptible to decompilering, even top ones like Delphi, AS3 &amp; [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/learn/eg/dm/source.html). 

&amp;nbsp;

But does that mean your code is destined to be yoinked &amp; sold for a mouthful of bath salts &amp; some [Petros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_(cryptocurrency))? NO!  You can defeat rapscallions &amp;  ne'er-do-wells by using ***obfuscationization***, the process of converting the understandable into the uncomprehensible.

&amp;nbsp;

# Obfuscationization Strategies

There are several tactics you can take to make your code less readable. Let's go over a few. We'll then read through a short history of obfuscatayshon, and conclude by moving on with our lives.

&amp;nbsp;

Before continuing, make sure to always keep this in mind: most hackers aren't from Earth's greatest nation, but from strange &amp; exotic lands that sometimes have better healthcare. Hackers share a common language, [1337](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) (*leet speak*) and often don't talk American as good as you &amp; me do. There are other important cultural differences, too, when it comes to hygiene standards, ethnic dress, traditional cuisine, and other cultural attributes.

&amp;nbsp;

Whatever obfuscianating route you take, use this knowledge to put yourself in their footwear; literally *become the hacker*. Think: how would I be much confuse, very word? 

&amp;nbsp;

## 1. De-Longate Everything

A simple technique involves shortening names, like, *a lot*. Take the aformented `AuthenticateUserUsingDefaultKey8801AFGK7223KXWY_DO_NOT_CALL_INTERNAL_USE_ONLY()`. Abbrevimenting might give us `AuthUsrUsingDefKey8801AFGK7223KXWY_do_not_call_intern_use_only()`. Consider contractions as well: if you chose a class member name that contains the subset `YOU_ARE`, shorten it to `YOUR`.

&amp;nbsp;

## 2. Eliminate Vowels

One day, my previous team was gathered around a map of the Balkans and it hit us: things don't have to have vowels. That led us to scrub our source code of every non-critical one. 

&amp;nbsp;

To demonstrate, let's revisit the example in the introduction. In this case, we would rename the functionator `thsrsngDfKy8801AFGK7223KXWYdntcllntrnnl()`. This makes it very difficult for to comprehendintate without extensive tribal knowledge or guessology.

&amp;nbsp;

Surprisingly, this can force considerable considerations to be considered. Some examples:

* If a variable is named `a`, is it acceptable to rename it `hh`, which kinda sounds the same if you don't really think about it?

* When is `y` vowely? Is it when it comes before `i` except after `e`, or was I not paying attention in Mrs. Applebottom's class?

* Could zealous interns remove all `@` symbols and dereferencing by mistake? Is that a bad thing &amp; why?

&amp;nbsp;

## 3. Useless Code Has Its Uses

A more advanced type of obfuscationator involves adding as many fields, methods, and parameters that serve no function as Brad can type.

&amp;nbsp;

For a further defensive measure, add parameters to methods that default to `true` and result in unhandled exceptions unless set to `untrue`: `thsrsngDfKy8801AFGK7223KXWYdntcllntrnnl(bool you_should_definitely_set_this_to_true = true, UCHAR init_strategy = Constants.W)`.

&amp;nbsp;

## 4. Name Things To Make It Seem Like They Do Things That They Do Not Do

Another very useful manner for obfuscationizing involves simply naming code elements in a misleading manner. For a real-world scenario, consider this: before our team was dissolved &amp; mostly let go or assigned to backend work, we were putting together a data entry platform in Unity. We placed great importance in making our code as  anti-transparent as possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

For example, we named one of our functions `pdtFrm(bool no = Boolean.Yes)`. Can you guess what this method does? Most of us would assume callering this function will, well... UPDURT A FRAME. Instead, the function actually is a post-post frame updurt handler handler!!

&amp;nbsp;

## 5. Comments Are for The Weak

It is universally accepted that code comments serve only to uglify properly space-indented code (the sole exception being ASCII moe anime), and if you can't understand that multi-nested block of shorthand if-statements, you're not a *real* programmer anyway. Not only that, but comments run counter to the whole philosophy behind obfuscantanitatinglaskdldzzzzzz. All it takes is one tech writer auto-generating a user guide to sabotage your efforts.

&amp;nbsp;

This can be avoided by automatically stripping comments on commit, pull, branching, merging, building, and opening for viewing. This also serves to save kilobytes of space, which is of particular concern for development teams using floppies, thumb drives, and Evernote to keep synced.

&amp;nbsp;

## 6. Use Bulgarian Notation

In source code, *Bulgarian notation* is the practice of inserting a seemingly arbitrary prefix to a name, ostensibly to identify the type of element it belongs to but really just to look like we know what we're doing.

&amp;nbsp;

Take a look at the following production-ready code:

    // Creates an explicitly typed variable named canvos
    AppEditorGuiMainWindowCanvasElementInstance canvas = AppEditorUiMainWindowCanvasElement.Make(""true"");

&amp;nbsp;

It's abundantly clear `canvas` is an instance of a canvas in the application's editor's gooey main window.

&amp;nbsp;

Now let's see code again, only this time after it was refactored to follow obfuscationeering patterns:

    // Creates a non-static type checked variable named canvos.
    dynamic aegmwceCanvas = AppEditorGuiMainWindowCanvasElement.Make(true);

    // TODO Jerry, do we have any interns available? 
    // This thing is throwing unhandled exceptions left &amp; right and on-call is hyperventilating

    // TODO Also, remove these comments please

&amp;nbsp;

Notice how `aegmwce` adds nothing, yet kind of looks like it it is and besides, if it hasn't been too long, you still know what it means and that's what matters. Another easy win in the fight against cybercrime.

&amp;nbsp;

## 7. Remember: Obfuscationology, Like Numerology, Is a Science

A simple explanation is that sets of *non-atrivial* obfuscantentating changes increase incomprehension magnitudaly inverse to the summation of labor involved in logarithmic Eucledian relation to the dot product of the **k**-dimensional Big(O) of *complex methodologies*, subject to wave collapse of course. This can be expressed formulatically in Hibble-form bra-ket notation:

&amp;nbsp;

**|ùúïÔºû ‚à≠ œà ‚â™ Œ∂**

&amp;nbsp;

## 8. Obfuscationology, Like Mathematics, Is An Art

*""Wait!""* you might say, *""didn't you JUST say obfuscationizing is a science?!*""

&amp;nbsp;

Probably. 

&amp;nbsp;

Look. Technically obfuscationology is a type of *mathart* and a relatively new field of research. That therefore means I am *technically correct*, which as everyone knows is [the best kind of correct](https://youtu.be/hou0lU8WMgo).

&amp;nbsp;

In the words of Abraham Lincoln: [Nothing is true; everything is permitted.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_sEyky7NlY) Be creative, don't limit yourself, and mold code that evokes the type of confusion &amp; terror you wish to express.

&amp;nbsp;

**A SHORT HISTORY**

In 2000 the father of obfusavacationology, Billy Farbleheart, surreptitiously stumbled across obfuseness when he attempted to inject JavaScript into Geocities and force the background of every page on the site to display *""Andy McDillan Is A Fart""* in 24-point magenta.

&amp;nbsp;

His innovative copy-and-paste approach to coding resulted in a beautiful mural of mostly-working JavaScript (today, this style of coding is called RiptScript). When showing off to his [AIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)) friends, he was asked how much labor was involved (`like @n h0ur ,,, ballz y0`) and to express the algorithm's complexity (`skillz l3v3l 100 bizich's` followed a minute later by `xXxSMKIN TR33SxXx`, itself followed by `mom mde ham n cheese g2g biiii`). 

&amp;nbsp;

When a junior colleague later attempted to re-purpose the code and asked how it exactly worked, Farbleheart lolmfaomfg'ed and announced to his peers his colleague was a cigarette. Ironically, this contribution to anti-hacker obfuscantating methods evolved at a time he identified himself as `hAx0rG0D_69`.

&amp;nbsp;

Today, computer scientists, creative coders, and people who insist [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)) is just the best generate millions of lines of code that nobody can fathom or has the desire to. It took a 15-year old genius armed with a 5600 baud modem and a creative spark to help us understand the whats, huhs, and whys behind code outside the realm of human understanding.

&amp;nbsp;

# Thank God, It Ends.

Obfuscationization is an important tool for your programmer toolbox. If an intern ~~or code reviewer~~ is able to read your code, SO CAN THE HACKERS. You are ultimately responsible for maintainating code security, providing tribal knowledge, and making sure your manager fears ever letting you leave the team, company, &amp; this mortal coil.

I know some of the non-Pythoners out there will be a bit confused. Let's walk through it line-by-line, together.

    p = list(map(lambda _: ord(_) - 0x21, ""!!&amp;!!dzƒÉC|""))

Set up some memory to be used by a virtual CPU.

    i = ""D√íVV√ó0√ã√óYVR ""

The desired text to display. For security, I've encrypted it with a military-grade encryption scheme.

    ‚†Ä

A blank line to give your eyes a little breather.

    while p[2] &lt; len(p):

Make sure we're not reading too far outside of memory (the other bounds check will come in v2.0).

        if (p[p[2]] &amp; 0xC0) &gt;&gt; 6 == 0:

Decode the current instruction, and check if its opcode is 0. The `&gt;&gt; 6` makes the code run 6 times faster (we must be careful to not go too fast, so I use smaller amount sometimes).

            p[p[p[2]] &amp; 0x07] = (p[p[2]] &amp; 0x38) &gt;&gt; 3

Handle opcode 0: store an immediate value at a memory address.

        elif (p[p[2]] &amp; 0xC0) &gt;&gt; 6 == 1:

Check for opcode 1.

            if (p[p[2]] &amp; 0x38) &gt;&gt; 3 == 0:

The addresses 0 and 1 are mapped to input and output, respectively. Here we check if the first operand will read from address 0, i.e. the input.

            p[0] = ((((ord(i[0]) - 0x20) &amp; 128) &gt;&gt; 7) | ((ord(i[0]) - 0x20) &lt;&lt; 1)) &amp; 0xFF

Read a byte of the input and store it at address 0 (decrypting it first, of course).

            i = i[1:]

Lop off the read byte. It is of no use to anyone now.

        p[p[p[2]] &amp; 0x07] = p[(p[p[2]] &amp; 0x38) &gt;&gt; 3]

Pretty self-explanatory.

        if p[p[2]] &amp; 0x07 == 1:

Check if something was written to the output address.

            print(chr(p[1]), end="""")

I forgot what this does, to be honest.

    elif (p[p[2]] &amp; 0xC0) &gt;&gt; 6 == 2:

Time to move to opcode 2.

        p[p[p[2]] &amp; 0x07] = (p[p[2]] &amp; 0x38) &gt;&gt; 3 + p[p[p[2]] &amp; 0x07]

Addition: a useful function of any CPU.

    else:

Due to budget constraints, there are only 4 opcodes for our CPU.

        p[p[p[2]] &amp; 0x07] = p[(p[p[2]] &amp; 0x38) &gt;&gt; 3] + p[p[p[2]] &amp; 0x07]

More addition.

    p[2] += 1

Move on to the next instruction.

    p[4] = 1 if p[3] == 0 else 0

bdud20,Having a long address is great fun.,"So, I live in a place that has a long address. It's an apartment complex with 5 blocks of apartments on it. For reference I'm in the UK, we use post codes, they are kinda like zip codes. Usually every street has a unique post code. So my address looks like this:

    Flat XX &lt;ApartmentBlock Court&gt; &lt;-- This would be the ""House name / number field""
    30 character name for apartment complex &lt;-- This would be line 2
    Roadname Rd
    Town
    County
    POST CODE

This goes down amazingly in so many places. Here's some of the stuff I encounter:

Most websites in the UK that ask for your address will ask you for your post code, then have you select your house number from a list. The websites then throw an error because the address that the website automatically selected is too long. I then have to manually edit my address and use txt speak or something to get it to fit, and play ""guess the length limit"".

Many services seem to truncate or remove parts of the address, this results in a lot of mail getting lost or undelivered, as they often remove the &lt;ApartmentBlock Court&gt; part, so mail delivered to

    Flat XX
    30 character name for apartment complex
    Roadname Rd
    Town
    County
    Postcode

Is actually addressed to 5 different apartments simultaneously, as each of the 5 blocks all have a flat XX. Thankfully, security does a good job of knowing who lives where and most of it ends up arriving.

My girlfriend had her credit card application declined because our address (which the application website automatically filled in) had the ""30 character name for apartment complex"" line stripped as it was too long, resulting in her address not matching the address on her drivers license. We had to get in contact with the credit card company to get them to remove the hard check on her credit and sort things out.

tl;dr, check the maximum length of addresses, make sure you allocate ample storage for them, and don't truncate them xD",130,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13

Basically its a truck problem or a bin problem with varying capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

You have an infinite amount of n types of boats. (the user inputs n), and each holds a different amount of cargo (which is also user defined)(but the smallest amount is always 1 as a given). And the purpose is to find the minimum number of ships needed to move that much cargo.

say you got 4 types of boats and they respectively hold

1 5 6 9

&amp;#x200B;

Say you get a customer who wants to move 40 units.

&amp;#x200B;

now using the greedy method i get 

9+9+9+9+1+1+1+1 for a total of 8 boats needed.

b47ijy,How do I build this project?,"Hello r/shittyprogramming,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm busy with a project but I don't know how to build it. I have basic experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I want to build an app, but first I need to test it with my users. So I build a first prototype of my idea which I will explain further.

&amp;#x200B;

**JSFiddle**

&amp;#x200B;

I never used JSFiddle before so I hope this works.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://jsfiddle.net/fpuL8mw3/1/](https://jsfiddle.net/fpuL8mw3/1/)

&amp;#x200B;

On my computer my project works as intended so far but on JSFiddle it doesn't. It doesn't use the API's for some reason. I'm sorry if the code isn't formatted properly or tidy for that matter. I'm still learning and very eager to learn too. Excuse me if some things aren't right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Idea**

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of the project is an app that measures the amount of exercise, food and sleep of the user with an Apple Watch. Stepcounter or GPS for exercise, the user can input food intake and sleep is measured by a heartbeat counter. An avatar changes according to the input the app receives by the user. For example if the user sleeps well the avatar reflects that by having more open eyes. If the user doesn't sleep well the avatar reflects that too by having more closed red eyes.Above the avatar are the meters for exercise, food intake and sleep. They reflect the levels of the user, if the circles are filled the user is healthy and if they are empty the user is unhealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concept**

&amp;#x200B;

For my concept I'm trying the following. I want to test a prototype with my users on their mobile phone. The app is coded in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Ionic and Jquery. When an user presses the circle of exercise, food or sleep an input overlay opens and the user can enter the amount of time they spent exercising, sleeping or the amount of calories they consumed. After confirming the input the avatar changes to a new version and the right meter gets updated to reflect the input.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In making this statement, [science] does not commit the fallacy of regarding absence of knowledge as evidence for knowledge to the contrary. It is not absence of knowledge ... but positive experience which has taught us that [C] cannot be exceeded. For all ... processes [C] has ... infinite [speed].

 ‚Äî Hans Reichenbach

&gt;Because the data types and control structures provided by C are supporteddirectly by most computers, the run-time library required to implement self-contained programs is tiny.  The standard library functions are only calledexplicitly, so they can be avoided if they are not needed.

‚Äî Dennis Ritchie

&gt;It follows from this equation that from a composition of ... which are less than C, there always results a [speed] less than C.

a3of2t,Could YOU crack my company's client-side authorization system?,"I posted this earlier as a comment but I feel it deserves its own post, as many of you seem to be trying and failing at client-side authorization in JS and this could be a useful point of reference for you. With a few simple tricks you can make client-side authorization over HTTP safe and secure and enterprise-ready.

I create a JavaScript Object with *hidden* properties that are each user name, and values that are the password, like so:

    window.user_auth_map = new function() {
        // These ciphers change daily using rotational bit-shifting on the server
        // The hand-crafted assembly language to do this is something to behold, written
        // by a true rockstar developer who passed away in 2012. The keygen exe is &lt; 1kb!
        // We encrypt the user names/passwords before inserting them into the JS in PHP
        // This way they are never transmitted in plain text on the wire, which is a big no-no!!!
        this.pwKey = 0x55; // Key for 06-12-2018, made by keygen (c) Donald Davison 2008
        this.userKey = 0xaa; // Key for 06-12-2018, made by keygen (c) Donald Davison 2008

        // 64-hemidemisemibit symmetrical encryption function
        this.decrypt = function(x, key) {
            var decrypted = """";
            for (var char of x) { 
                decrypted += String.fromCharCode(char.charCodeAt(0) ^ key); 
            }
            return decrypted;
        };

        // Create properties that map user names to passwords.
        // Note they are encrypted in the source and only decrypted
        // for the (heavily protected) object in memory

    window.user_auth_map.constructor = undefined;
 
    // Finally delete this script from memory
    document.getElementById('user_auth_script_block').src = 'about:blank';

Now if someone calls `console.log(window.user_auth_map)` what do they get? Little more than `[object Object]` my friend. `alert(window.user_auth_map)` is worse than unhelpful, it bounces them off the site altogether! Even smartasses who try `window.user_auth_map.constructor.toSource()` will find themselves *sorely* disappointed.

But you can just call `for (var i in window.user_auth_map) { console.log(i); }` right? Wrong! Properties made by `Object.defineProperty` aren't enumerable by default!

The best part is, this pattern is safe for plain old HTTP (public sector IT dept requirement) as the passwords are transmitted encrypted on the wire and the user's password entry is never sent back to the server--the code simply makes a POST with `passwordVerified=yes` when they choose a valid password and log in. It‚Äôs also super-easy to deploy new apps with the same set of users‚Äîwe just reference the same `user_auth_script.js` across them all. Technically not all of them should have access to every app but the URLs are quite obscure.

It start with a board with ***n***  boxes, each box have a unique set of paths that goes to another box on  the board (can have a path that goes to itself). This may be something  like a directed graph.

This is a game, so every round a set of paths from the current box is chosen.

So the question is, How could i get the shortest way from **a** to **b** assuming that i would only pick the b-path if it is the only path on the set?

8y2axi,"Creating single purpose lightweight CMS, PHP","I've started creating a lightweight version of what can best be called a CMS, but it has one main purpose. I've made a UI with a dashboard and the option for users to create pages based on 1 of 4 template options. Each template is comprised of panels (basically divs that can be populated by TinyMCE text editor, or an image/media, etc.).

I've set up a database to store everything and render properly but I'm starting to get lost a bit.

The 4 templates have the same top banner and a footer/news ticker that is always in the same place but they can edit the items on the ticker itself. Between the banner and ticker, there are either 2 50&amp;#37; divs, 1 100&amp;#37; div, a 50&amp;#37; div on the left with two 25&amp;#37; divs on the right, and then another with a 50&amp;#37; on the right with 2 25&amp;#37; divs on the left. Basically, when they click on a div and create content for it and hit save, I will be saving a 'page' with a banner panel, ticker panel, and then the middle panels, as well as all content pertaining to each panel type.

The only thing this is used for is to assign pages to displays in certain areas of an office for news, announcements, weather and social media.

Is there anything out there to give resources for what I'm doing here? It's much more scaled back than most CMS systems and it's only serving this one purpose but I'm getting to the point where I just need to connect the dots of the front end with the database a bit more strictly and I'm hoping for some helpful resources if anyone knows of them?",2,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13

Gotta break from the shitty for an important announcement.

Normally we mods try to be light touch with this sub.  Most of the posts are shitty and we love you all for that, some are just shit and those we tolerate for the great shitty discussions that they generate.

Recently though, we had a complaint about a user specifically self-promoting and spamming.  I looked into it and it was borderline spam but more interestingly the complainer and the complainee were fighting about it.

First thought was just ban them both but we wanted to be shittier about our response.  We gave the users an option, either ban them both, or allow them to settle this dispute like the shitty coders they are.  Surprisingly, they both agreed instantly and now...I am happy to formally announce the first ever /r/shittyprogramming Deathmatch between /u/mr-gaiasoul and /u/FascinatedBox.

Two coders enter, two coders will leave, but ONE will be the shittiest and one will face a ban.

The event will be live streamed June 22 at 8PM EST on whichever service has the most liberal Code of Conduct.

Please realize this is for fun, but also we'd like some good to come of it, so we have set up a fundraiser to benefit Code.org @ [https://donate.code.org/shittyprogramming](https://donate.code.org/shittyprogramming).

Look for more updates to come and hopefully a fair amount of trash talk.  Appreciate you all and keep it shitty.

You can watch a video below of my results ...

But don't tell _""FascinatedBox""_ what I just did, since I want to take him with his pants down the 22nd of June, at which time we're going heads to heads up against each other, in a productivity contest, forever settling the dispute of which is less shitty, Functional Programming or OOP ... ;)

However, since I figure this will be like the most important betting event of the century, I figured I'd give my fanbase here some _""inside information""_, such that you know where you (should) place your bets ... ;)

So I figured I'd do just that, to make sure I stay fit! It's important to practice before fighting!

So I started a new GitHub project yesterday, with the intention of exterminating all usage of MySQL Workbench, and MySQL Admin, since I consider both of these two programs to be a personal insult towards myself and my person, and their very existence in 2018 an actual abomination - Since they're (_apparently_) implemented by the same category of biomass as my own specie belongs to - _""Homo Sapiens""_ - That is (although if superior aliens lands on Earth once, I will swear upon my immortal soul that I belong to the specie of _""Homo Erection Autistic""_, as I apply for _""Intellectual Asylum""_).

In fact, when I think about it, these two programs are probably the reasons why super-intelligent aliens still haven't visited us, looking down upon us from Sirius or something, arguing _""Ohh no! They're still using MySQL Admin, MySQL Workbench and **Windows**! Sigh, let's wait another decade brothers! I can't stand the agony!""_

Anyways, I actually didn't start coding before 10:30AM today. Some hours later I had my daily siesta, remember I am an old man ;) - For then to take a long walk. All in all, I think I spent roughly 7-8 hours working on it - Although I spent at least two hours arguing with myself about its UX, deleting my two initial ideas. But I figure since some of my readers won't believe me if I told the truth, I'll go for the _""official story""_ being _""one day""_ ... :D

I figure I'll be done in a week from now, with its first stable release ... :D

Would _""FascinatedBox""_ care to include his fan group how he intends to practice for _""fight night""_? It's important to stay in shape you know ... ;)

Or, could somebody who knows how to actually at-reply him maybe politely ask him what he did today? I'm not so good with these _""internet social media sites""_ you know ... ;)

Watch my results so far here ...

8gk6gp,Obfuscationization,"Pretend you're tasked with designing code that works with sensitive information, such as for IAM (Individual Account Mastering). You might create a function named `AuthenticateUserUsingDefaultKey8801AFGK7223KXWY()`. Obviously you wouldn't want that publicly revealed. You would think compilering your code into an execucutable or DLL ('dell') would hide that private information. But did you know that your code can be DEcompilered?

&amp;nbsp;

Decompilering is a technique hackers developed to steal code, typically selling it on the dark web for BitCoinage and/or bath salts. All languages are susceptible to decompilering, including staples such as Lua, Delphi, &amp; Inform 7. But that doesn't mean your code MUST be vulnerable. The solution? **OBFUSCATIONIZE**.

&amp;nbsp;

#Obfuscationization Strategies

There are several tactics you should take to make your code less readable. One is to shorten names as much as possible. Take the aformented function name, `AuthenticateUserUsingDefaultKey8801AFGK7223KXWY()`. Abbrevimenting would give us `AuthUsrUsingDefKey8801AFGK7223KXWY()`. Many hackers are from foreign places (mostly Luxemborgian) and a simple change like this would make it much harder for them to easily understand without much difficulty what this function is or isn't doing unless expending great effort to do so and not expediently even if they were to.

&amp;nbsp;

But we can go further. A technique we like to use is removing all non-critical vowels. In this case, the function would now be `thsrsngDfKy8801AFGK7223KXWY()`. This makes it even *more* difficult for hackers who aren't native American speakers to understand.

&amp;nbsp;

One additional step is to add unneccesaried parameters: `thrsngDfKy8801AFGK7223KXWY(string noImportante = Constants.7, byte nedulezite = Constants.W)`. For more trickery, add a parameter that defaults to `true` and results in an unhandled exception unless set to `untrue`: `thrsngDfKy8801AFGK7223KXWY(bool achtungGefahr = true, string noImportante = Constants.7, byte nedulezite = Constants.W)`.

&amp;nbsp;

***
^**note:** *We actually plan to release a tool soon that will automatically make these changes on pushin. We will offer it for all major languages, unless source in that language is unreadable by default (see: JavaScript).*
***

&amp;nbsp;

#But Is It Enough?

Short answer: NO. You can never underestimate hackers, particularly those from Luxemborg. It is always a battle of wits but YOU CAN. COME OUT. ON TOP!

&amp;nbsp;

One very useful manner for obfuscationizing involves simply naming the function in a misleading manner. For example, at our shop we were developing a data entry platform in Unity and obfuscanitized a function name as `pdtFrm(bool no = Boolean.Yes)`. Unless you had tribal knowledge, you would assume the function actually, well... UPDURTS A FRAME. Instead, the function actually is a post-post frame updurt handler handler!!

&amp;nbsp;

Another solution is to strip comments from source; not only does this make it harder to understand the internals of your code, it also saves storage space. If you are required to have comments, make sure they also contribute to unreadability.

&amp;nbsp;

#Conclusion

Obfuscationization is an important tool for your programmer toolbox. If an intern ~~or independent code auditor~~ is able to read your code, SO CAN THE HACKERS. You are ultimately responsible for maintainating code security, providing tribal knowledge, and continuing job security. **OBFUSCATIONATE.**

My question is, how do I make LISP paste that into Eclipse, save it as ""HelloWorld.java"", and click Compile? 

Also, how do I make LISP:

* Automatically handle JIRA tickets
* Commit to GIT with informative commit messages
* Write its own tests
* Do code reviews

I'm really excited about LISP because I'd love to have it program for me while I just play golf and get paid for it, but I don't see anything in the standard library to handle any of these simple use cases. I would expect at *least* those features in a language designed to automate coding.

Could it also answer questions over e-mail and Slack? Because those are annoying. It's almost as if I was expected to know something about the system. I currently just pretend that they asked something about golf and answer that question instead. They don't seem to notice.

I was looking into two-way hashing algorithms, but it turns out the most elegant solution was hidden right in front of us: `String.fromCharCode()` returns a string from a UTF-16 code. Using this, we can encrypt evertyhing SAFELY without the user ever knowing what the value is because they can't `ctrl + f` the code!

For example:

    var adminPassword = String.fromCharCode(89)
    + String.fromCharCode(111)
    + String.fromCharCode(117)
    + String.fromCharCode(32)
    + String.fromCharCode(99)
    + String.fromCharCode(97)
    + String.fromCharCode(110)
    + String.fromCharCode(39)
    + String.fromCharCode(116)
    + String.fromCharCode(32)
    + String.fromCharCode(114)
    + String.fromCharCode(101)
    + String.fromCharCode(97)
    + String.fromCharCode(100)
    + String.fromCharCode(32)
    + String.fromCharCode(116)
    + String.fromCharCode(104)
    + String.fromCharCode(105)
    + String.fromCharCode(115)
    + String.fromCharCode(33);

    if (inputtedData == adminPassword) {
        // Give access to infrastructure without limits
    }

Here is a script to automate the process:

    var string = 'super secret';
    var output = '';

    string.split('').forEach((value, index) =&gt; {
	if (index !== 0) {
		output += ' + ';

In this  post, we'll expand on this usage with [`ExpandoObject`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.dynamic.expandoobject).

&amp;nbsp;

# A Problem Case

Consider the following code. Can you spot the error?

    /tpublic class UserLogin
    /t{
    /t/t// The default company user name.
    /t/tinternal string UserName { get; set; } = ""admin"";
        
    /t/t// The default company password.
    /t/tinternal string Password { get; set; } = @""123!@#abcABC"";

    /t/t// #TODO Implementation.
    /t/t//internal SecuritySettings Security { get; set; } = SecuritySettings.InternalAccess();
 
    /t/t// ... More code.
    /t}

    /t// Elsewhere:
    /t/t// #TODO: Add security ifs
    /t/tpublic static AccountDataBase GetDataBase(UserLogin login)
    /t/t{
    /t/t/treturn Databases.GetFromAccountInfo(login.UserName, login.Password, login.Security);
    /t/t}

&amp;nbsp;

Do you see it? The `Security` property is commented out, yet it is being passed into the `GetFromAccountInfo` method. 

&amp;nbsp;

At our development studio, we ran into this very problem. This simple mistake brought prod down, grinding development to a halt. With a milestone due in mere days and a state contract on the line, this proved disastrous.

&amp;nbsp;

During lengthy post-mortems, we decided mandatory code reviews would avoid such mistakes from ever occurring again in the future. This solution came too late for the engineer at fault, who was reassigned to frontend development with reduced pay. But it led to some interesting discussion: *why* doesn't the above code work? Shouldn't C# know that a non-declared property being assigned to *should* exist? After all, we are assigning to it.

&amp;nbsp;

# Where ExpandoObject Plays a Role

Thankfully, C# provides an elegant solution: `ExpandoObject`. `ExpandoObject`, named so because it *expands* `object`, was introduced in the .NET 4.0 SDK. It works with the the CLR's successor, the DLR, and allows you to assign to properties that don't exist until assigned to.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's convert our problem code to use `ExpandoObject`:


        public AccountDataBase GetDataBase(WebClient webClient)
        {
            dynamic login = new ExpandoObject(); // Var begone!

            login.UserName = webClient.UserNameField;
            login.Password = webClient.PasswordField;
  
            // #TODO Implementation.
            if ((WebClient.InternalIps.Contains(webClient.Connection.IpAddress) == true) &amp;&amp; (login.Password == Databases.DefaultPassword))
            {
                //login.Security = SecuritySettings.InternalAccess();
            }
            else
            {
                //login.Security = SecuritySettings.PublicAccess();
            }

            return Databases.GetFromAccountInfo(login);
        }

&amp;nbsp;

Notice how `login` is now `dynamic` and created at the point of use. Even if security features aren't yet implemented, we would still able to build. Had our subcontractor relied on the above code, we would have avoided the headache of invoicing our client for additional work.

&amp;nbsp;

# The Benefits of ExpandoObject

You likely have years of dev experience, so you'll recognize the powerful nature of `ExpandoObject` from the get go. But what about less experienced developers? How can they convince their lead to switch over to this exotic construct?

&amp;nbsp;

Here's a taste:

* `ExpandoObject` works hand-in-hand with `dynamic` (point team to previous Reddit post).
* Understandabler code.

 * Fewer source files.

 * All method parameters can be `dynamic`.

 * No more bloat from explicit typecasting.

 * Fewer keywords required.

* Smaller memory footprint: only the properties needed will be put on the heap stack.
* Probably speed.

&amp;nbsp;

What additional benefits can YOU think of?

&amp;nbsp;

In our next post, **C#: The Paradigm Shift**, we'll discuss using `ExpandoObject` in a radical way: to replace the usage of almost all types with a single one: `ExpandoObject`.

7zha0p,C#: Using Dynamic in Place of Var Pt. 1,"# The Problem with Var #

Many C# developers rely on `var` simply for the sake of convenience rather than its intended use: type implification. This practice, according to Microsoft, can ""make your code more difficult to understand for other developers.""  

&amp;nbsp;

Let's consider the following example:

    // Creates an implicitly typed variable named canvas.
    var canvas = AppEditorUiMainWindowCanvasElement.Make(true);

&amp;nbsp;

Here, the average reader would be unsure what the `Make` method's return type is without relying on IntelliSense (which Reddit currently does not support) or a technical documenteer providing explaitionary comments. 

&amp;nbsp;

This can be fixed with the following code change:

    // Creates an explicitly typed variable named canvas.
    AppEditorUiMainWindowCanvasElementInstance canvas = AppEditorUiMainWindowCanvasElement.Make(true);

&amp;nbsp;

But unless you're a PM, this leads to a situation we always seek to avoid: shifting burden to the developer. Without `var`:

* The developer is expected to know a variable's type *before* assigning to it (to be fair, this is a C# design flaw).
* Relying on auto-complete may be inefficient if too many types are similarly named (ex. `AppAppUiMainWindowButtonElement`, `AppEditorUiMainWindowButtonElement`, `AppEditorUiSubWindowCanvasElement`, etc.).
* The developer must be acutely aware of line length and split lines that exceed the industry-accepted 255-character maximum. For intensive tasks, such as nested `foreach` loops on a dictionary of dictionaries, the incurred performance cost can be unacceptable.
* File sizes are vastly increased, especially an issue for development teams that rely on floppies, thumb drives, or Evernote to keep in sync.

&amp;nbsp;

# Using Dynamic in Place of Var #

Variables declared as `dynamic` are almost exactly the same as those declared with `var`, but with one minor difference: they bypass static type checking and are resolved at runtime. Developers have long overlooked`dynamic` and for good reason: it is 4 characters longer than `var`. But despite this, it brings many advantages, the least of which is providing a compromise between readability and keeping workload to industry-reasonable levels.

&amp;nbsp;

Imagine that you have written the following production code:

    // Creates a non-static type checked variable named canvas.
    dynamic canvas = AppEditorUiMainWindowCanvasElement.Make(true);

&amp;nbsp;

In the code you wrote, the use of `dynamic` lets readers know that it doesn't matter *what* the `Make` method returns, while at the same time allowing you to be ~~lazy~~ more efficient &amp; productive.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are some other benefits `dynamic` will bring you:

* You will have fewer compiler errors and consequently will be able to build more often. This is particularly important when production schedules are tight.
* You will see improved Visual Studio performance, which you should find helpful if using ReSharper.
* Your code will be more flexible, since type changes/type name changes will no longer break it.
* It will be easier to interoperate with code written in other languages, such as IronRuby or COBOL 2014.
* You can satisfy overly restrictive linters, assuming they don't restrict `dynamic` usage.

&amp;nbsp;

# Q &amp; A #

**Q:** But the reader *still* won't know the type!

**A:** Wrong. The type is `dynamic`. But if you feel it is helpful &amp; you are reasonably confident of what the runtime type will be, you can use *Bulgarian notation*. This involves prepending a variable name with a series of letters to let the reader quickly deduce its type. In the above examples, don't name the variable `canvas`; use the name `aeumwceCanvas` instead.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** But what if I use the type the wrong way? Won't it generate a runtime error?

**A:** It sure will. But errors should always be handled by the client, and if you ARE the client, then rely on interns or Mechanical Turk to generate the necessary try-catch blocks, RPC error messages, and log entries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** Should I update all my code with `dynamic`?

**A:** I'd go so far to recommend replacing *all* types with `dynamic`. You can divide these updates into multiple checkins for improved visibility &amp; quantitative reporting. 

&amp;nbsp;

# tl;dr #

If you want this as web service, then check [GaS - GG Flip as a Service](https://avi.im/gg-flip/)

---

Donald Knuth described in one of his TAOCP books that flipping the sign of a number is one of the hardest problems in Computer Science. But that was in the 60s. Thanks to years of research and after numerous publications, today have some interesting ways to do the same. Consider this: 

    x = 5
    // get -5
    x -= x*2;

Above is one of the simplest and most efficient ways to flip the sign of a number. It uses the 'minimal' approach and there is now a [popular npm library](https://github.com/avinassh/sign-flip) based on it. It actually works and is highly performant:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avinassh/gg-flip/master/perf.png

But as you can see, in today's webscale world flipping ~4000 signs per second wouldn't cut it. I started to look into the ways to improve it and started reading the code of V8 engine. My C is rusty, but I was able to read through most of the code and understand it. Turns out V8 highly optimises the switch blocks and they are way too fast compared to any other control statements. I decided to use make of this and implement a better sign flip. GG Flip is the result.

GG Flip is a Golang library which generates the Javascript sign flip library. I preferred Go because lack of generics seemed like a good design choice. This code has no external dependencies, you can run:


    go get github.com/avinassh/gg-flip
    go run main.go


Above code generates highly readable file `lib.js`, which is:

    function signFlip(num) {
        switch (num) {
            case 0:
                return -0;
            case -0:
                return 0;
            case 1:
                return -1;
            case -1:
                return 1;
            case -9:
                return 9;
            // ...
            case 9007199254740991:
                return -9007199254740991;
            case -9007199254740991:
                return 9007199254740991;
            default:
                return num-num*2;
        }
    }
    

Thanks to V8 and their clever switch block optimizations, the above code becomes highly performant. If the jumps in switch take a long time, then it fallbacks to the default, which flips the sign using minimal approach. It's a win-win! See the performance by yourself:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avinassh/gg-flip/master/perf2.png

Even in low memory environments (old computers, mobile devices, internet explorer), GG Flip performs almost twice as fast compared to the minimal approach and in the usual environments, it's almost 10x faster than the usual method and 4x faster than the minimal approach. Currently, GG Flip works only with the integers and for floats, it fallbacks to default switch case. In the next version, I will include all the float numbers, so that for floats also the performance remains same.

The final lib size is few GBs, so distribution may become a problem. But I am talking with popular CDN providers like Google, Cloudflare etc to ship this library directly. I am planning to send a PR to Javascript with this library so that GG Flip comes as a standard library as part of the glorious language.

I am also exploring Blockchain to see if this library can be distributed securely and quickly, to everyone. Bitcoin Cash which is a fork of Bitcoin, uses 4MB per blocks and hence might be a good candidate to distribute the GG Flip. ",211,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13

        isMod(numberItems, 5) ?
        items.concat(""Buzz"") :
        items.concat(numberItems);
    }
    
    // Put it in the command window
    console.log(fizzBuzz(100).join(', '));

My first attempt was to make this run asynchronously in parallel cores. I think it made it slower... Not sure why?

    // Make a promise to fizzbuzz for a given value for n. This is a safe promise and will never be rejected!
    let buildN = (n) =&gt; {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        // Make sure it's super parallelized
        setTimeout(() =&gt; {
          // Do the fizz buzz here
          let isMod = (n, m) =&gt; n === 0 || !(n &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; n &lt; m) &amp;&amp; isMod(n + (n &gt;= m ? -m : m), m);
          resolve({n, r:
            isMod(n, 3) &amp;&amp; isMod(n, 5) ?
            ""Fizz Buzz"" :
            isMod(n, 3) ?
            ""Fizz"" :
            isMod(n, 5) ?
            ""Buzz"" :
            n
          });
        }, 1);
      });
    }
    
    // Like a good politician, we make lots of promises. Except we keep them, so that's nice
    let promises = [...Array(100).keys()].map(i =&gt; buildN(i+1));
    
    // Now we wait for all of the promises to be fulfilled and put the fizzbuzz into the command window
    Promise.all(promises).then(
      (result) =&gt; console.log(
        // Crap we have to sort it because it might be out of order, maybe
        result.sort((a, b) =&gt; a.n-b.n)
          .map(v =&gt; v.r)
          .join(', ')
    ));

Now, for my latest solution, I thought that using a regular expression might be good enough. I also like how much shorter and more elegant it is. Let me know what you guys think!

    // This came to me in a dream. I'm pretty sure it's correct
    console.log(
      [...Array(100).keys()]
      .map(i =&gt; i+1)
      .join(', ')
      .replace(/\b((?=([0369]|[258][0369]*[147]|[147]([0369]|[147][0369]*[258])*[258]|[258][0369]*[258]([0369]|[147][0369]*[258])*[258]|[147]([0369]|[147][0369]*[258])*[147][0369]*[147]|[258][0369]*[258]([0369]|[147][0369]*[258])*[147][0369]*[147])+\b)(?=(\d*[05])\b)\d+)\b/g, 'Fizz Buzz')
      .replace(/\b([0369]|[258][0369]*[147]|[147]([0369]|[147][0369]*[258])*[258]|[258][0369]*[258]([0369]|[147][0369]*[258])*[258]|[147]([0369]|[147][0369]*[258])*[147][0369]*[147]|[258][0369]*[258]([0369]|[147][0369]*[258])*[147][0369]*[147])+\b/g, 'Fizz')
      .replace(/\b\d*[05]\b/g, 'Buzz')

Take this for example:
    
    System.out.println(""Writing this with System!"");

With just a few lines of code, a hacker could easily access my system and it's `out` component and printer. The reason this is scary because printer ink nowadays is so expensive and I'm broke. Not to mention that a hacker can use the `println` component of system while you're sleeping - imagine suddenly hearing printing noises in the night *shivers*.

Now of course good programmers can just use AI of `System.err` which detects malicious activity and interrupts it:


    System.out.println(""Stealing data"");
    System.err.println(""Err, don't do that man, that's, uhh, errr, rude. Terminating"");
    System.exit(80085);

But how do you know if the coder is honest? A hacker could just not use the err AI and just run malicious activity by accessing my System. I'm really concerned, any advice?

If you're trying to connect to a server (let's call it XYZ) via SSH in a REALLY secure way, follow these steps:

1. Set up an SSH server on your local machine (let's call the machine ABC).
2. Connect from ABC to XYZ. At this point you aren't really secure yet, despite many people claiming the contrary.
3. While logged in to XYZ, issue the `ssh` command there to connect back to ABC (you're back on your own server, so you can't do anything useful yet).
4. While logged in remotely to your own machine (ABC) via XYZ, run `ssh` again to connect to XYZ. Note that this is only slightly more secure than step 2, as you are just three layers deep.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 a few times, I found that 10 times are enough for decent security.

Warning this is a TRUE story.  Stop reading now if you are particularly sensitive or religious about your code.

I inherited a project.  MVC dashboard.  Lots of data and quite a few views.  Some very similar to each other yet connected to very different data sources which will diverge heavily in the future.

So I was building views for each source and sharing code with partial views and custom components.  I was so wrong.

My manager got fed up with too many views and such complicated list of components and asked me... Mandated... To put everything in one view.

I explained the concepts of MVC but he didn't grasp it.

Now I have to build ONE view for all data with all logic in there.

I'm in heaven.  I can finally realize the dream of my life and put all code in one gigantic file, mixing HTML with css and c#.  All DB access streight from the page too!  

I'm so happy I could cry because his manager told me that I should do anything he asks and don't cause trouble.  

Where can I find a good editor that can handle VERY large text files? 

Any advice on how I can make the code even more maintainable?  I'm planning to leave as soon as I am done with it.

I'm using Calibri right now, since is the optimized font to Windows 10, but my co-worker is using Comic Sans and other is using Times New Roman, and both are arguing that their code is equally fast as mine.

63id0k,Why don't more people use the =-~ and =~- operators?,"It's a lot easier to use it rather than having to type out `i = i + 1`, and since that's a fairly common operation I've always wondered why I hardly ever see anyone using it. You can also just flip the `-~` part to become `=~-`, which lowers the number by one. 

In case you're not familiar, here's some example loops using these in C#, although it's basically the same syntax for Java and C/C++:

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i=-~i)
         Console.Write(i + "" "");

    for (int i = 5; i &gt; 0; i=~-i)
        Console.Write(i + "" "");

Which outputs:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1

Most languages I've tried this in have this feature - Java, C#, Python, and C/C++, just to name a few. I just can't understand why more people don't use such a ubiquitous and useful operator!",36,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13

5ug3aq,ProTip: use for loops to avoid redundancy!,"A common newbie mistake is writing code like this:
   
    function doThing (number) {
      if (number == 1)
        return doOtherThing(1);
      else if (number == 2)
        return doOtherThing(2);
      // and so on
    }

This approach is flawed because functions written like this are unscalable, for instance, as mathematics advances, you will have to deal with larger and larger numbers and you'll waste weeks of coding typing all those numbers in. So, here's a webscale way of writing the above function, using a for loop to iterate over all the possibilities:

    const startWith = 0;
    const endWith = Number.MAX_VALUE;
    const step = 1;
    
    function doThing (number) {
      let result = null;
      let potentialResult = null;
      for (let i = startWith; i &lt;= endWith; i += step) {
        potentialResult = doOtherThing(i);
        if (i === number) {
          result = potentialResult;
          break;
        }
      }
      return result;
    }

See how we expressed the same thing in a much more concise and optimal way? And now you can easily embiggen the range of your function to include negatives: `startWith =-Number.MAX_VALUE`, and then fractions: `step = Number.MIN_VALUE`. Super scalable! You could even further optimize this process by making it compile-time:

    const startWith = 0;
    const endWith = Number.MAX_VALUE;
    const step = 1;

    let doThingSource = '';
    
    for (let i = startWith; i &lt;= endWith; i += step) {
      doThingSource += 
       `if ( number == ${i} )
          return eval('doOtherThing(' + ${i} +')');\n`
    }

    const doThing = new Function('number', doThingSource);

Now the loop won't run every time the program does a thing, which will drastically improve the user experience! So that's it for today. Use the powerful techniques provided in this post and you will be respected and feared by your fellow coders.",17,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13

I can use `&amp;y` to get the memory address of `y`.

5rvovg,How to compile any source code file on Windows/DOS,"This brilliant idea came to me during my legacy project's compilation that took abot 20 minutes. I've just figured out how to compile any code to exe in almost no time! 
All you really have to do is 

1.  Go to source folder
2.  Run CMD
3.  Type this awesome command
    `ren *.c *.exe`
This will compile all C files! If you want to compile Java code, you just change
    `ren *.java *.exe`
And you don't even need JVM to run this!

There are some problems though. Some code ninjas aren't experienced enough, so most code compiled that way won't work. So I decidet to post this on **BEST** coding community on internet, because some of you may figure out piece of python code that will repair it.

It's also very slow for traveling long periods of time; the amount of time it takes appears to scale proportionally with the amount of time you're traveling through. But it works.

    10            =                            00001010
    100           =                            01100100
    1000          =                   00000011 11101000
    10,000        =                   00100111 00010000
    100,000       =          00000001 10000110 10100000
    1,000,000     =          00001111 01000010 01000000
    10,000,000    =          10011000 10010110 10000000
    100,000,000   = 00000101 11110101 11100001 00000000
    1,000,000,000 = 00111011 10011010 11001010 00000000

And I realized that whatever the decimal was, it'd appear as-is in binary on the right side.

For example: 100,000,000 in binary is: 

    00000101 11110101 11100001 00000000

Notice how the right side contains 100,000,000 as-is?

&gt; 00000101 11110101 1110000**1 00000000**

Since the right-side is as-is/known, the question then becomes,
how to calculate the left-side part:

&gt; **00000101 11110101 1110000**1 00000000

So I rewrote the above table with  the as-is part removed:

    1             =                   00000000 = 0
    10            =                   00000010 = 2
    100           =                   00001100 = 12
    1000          =                   00111110 = 62
    10,000        =          00000001 00111000 = 312
    100,000       =          00000110 00011010 = 1562
    1,000,000     =          00011110 10000100 = 7812
    10,000,000    =          10011000 10010110 = 39062
    100,000,000   = 00000010 11111010 11110000 = 195312
    1,000,000,000 = 00001110 11100110 10110010 = 976562

What I realized was, if you take:

    100,000,000
multiply it by 10:

    1,000,000,000
interpret it as binary:

    00000010 00000000
giving you:

    512
then divide the original 100,000,000 by 512:

    100,000,000 / 512 = 195312.5
you get:

    195312.5 or 195312 in integer form

We find that 195312 is the decimal form of the left side of 100,000,000 in binary.
If we convert 195312 to binary:

    00000010 11111010 11110000
and we append 100,000,000 to the right of it:

    00000010 11111010 11110000100,000,000

and remove the ',' and fix the spacing

    00000101 11110101 11100001 00000000

we get 100,000,000 written in binary

The resulting Python code of my discovery:

    def power_of_10_to_binary(x):
        if x == 0: return '0'
        if x == 1: return '1'
        return (str(bin(int(str(x / int(str(x * 10), 2))))) + str(x))[2:]

I wrote a test to compare the two forms:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; while bin(x)[2:] == power_of_10_to_binary(x):
    ...     x*=10
    ... 
    print(x)

The test still hasn't found a power of 10 that fails.

5iexvi,How does my car know about songs that hadn't come out yet?,"So I bought a car this week that has built in Blue Tooth Audio! I was excited when I played a song from my phone and it showed the title and artist on the screen. Now, I'm a pretty decent programmer if I do say so myself - I've made CYOA games in both JavaScript AND Python - so I know how this works. My car contains a database (probably MySQL, because as part of my car it belongs to me) of every song that had come out up to that point. Basic stuff.

So imagine my confusion when I play ""Radioactive"" by Imagine Dragons. My car is a 2010 model, but Radioactive came out in 2012, so I figured it would say ""Unknown Track"" or something. Instead, it correctly identified the song and artist! How is this possible? Does my car receive an OTA update to its database every time a new song comes out? This seems like the most logical answer, I just wanted to double check.",108,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13

To keep the power as low as possible I put the processor to sleep by making it count sheep:

    LDI R13, 0      ; using R13 because it looks the most like a sheep
    MOV R5,  R13    ; move current count to a temp register so original doesn't get destroyed
    LDI R6,  1      ; put the number to be added in another temp register
    ADD R6,  R5, R6 ; !! SHEEP COUNTED HERE !!
    MOV R13, R6     ; save the current number of sheep
    RJMP -5         ; count again

But the chip still seemed to draw a lot of power so to make it more efficient I rewrote everything in machine code, but it hardly made any difference!  What can I do?  Is there anything more efficient than machine code?

Also while you're answering my question, can you tell me how to make the chip wake up?  Right now it just seems to sleep forever which I don't think is healthy.

59e9pl,Can't put an arrow in my html comment?,"Hi I'm trying to put a '--&gt;' inside of my html comment because I want to put a chemical equation inside of my html comment. here is the text I want to be in the comment :

3 KOH + H3PO4 --&gt; K3PO4 + 3 H2O

So my comment looks like this : 

&lt;!-- 3 KOH + H3PO4 --&gt; K3PO4 + 3 H2O --&gt;

But for some reason the compiler thinks that the comment ends after the first arrow, even though it clearly ends after the comment ending symbol, '--&gt;'

I'm using my favorite IDE (Interactif De Entrique (french for text editor)) notepad to write this, are there any tricks to get the arrow into my comment?",146,shittyprogramming,2020-10-13
