ja3r39,Is it true that inheritance isn't used that much in regular Java development?,"Hi all

So I am currently in training for a junior developer position. We are going over inheritance right now, and the course material says ""you'll find that inheritance is not as common as you think in Java web development"", which surprised me. The course material went on to say that interfaces are much more commonly used and preferred than inheritance.

Have you found this to be the case in your line of work? Thanks!",117,java,2020-10-13
j9mv3x,.toUUID(): A tiny library for generating human-readable UUIDs for automated tests,"We often use UUIDs where I work, which is fine, but UUIDs is a pain to deal with when you have to create them in tests:

* Creating UUIDs look ugly
* Creating UUIDs takes up a lot of space
* Creating UUIDs decrease the readability.

This might all be minor gripes I have, but I like my tests to be short and clean.

The most common way to generate a human-readable UUID is doing the following:

`UUID.fromString(""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"");`

If you use .toUUID() you can get the same result like this:

`toUUID(1);`

There's also a few more bells and whistles like generating UUIDs based on a collection, varargs or a range of integers.

If you find yourself having to deal with UUIDs in automated tests, or you want to generate a set of simple UUIDs quickly, then .toUUID() might be up your alley: [https://github.com/atomfinger/toUUID](https://github.com/atomfinger/toUUID)

.toUUID() were initially made by me, for me, but if UUIDs annoy me, then it might annoy others as well.

*Edit: thanks for the feedback. Especially thanks to the concrete feedback which pointed out flaws.*

*While this post has garnered a net-positive response in terms of up votes it has not been blessed with the same  positivity in the comments. The core issue, as I interpret it, is that people don't see the benefit of using this library compared to the current flow they are using, which clearly indicates that I haven't done a good enough job explaining this. I thought I had done a decent job (or made the false assumption that it was self evident), but it is obvious that I need to do better in this regard :) Again though, thanks for the feedback, it is appreciated.*",61,java,2020-10-13

j6bwoq,[Rant] Has this ever happened to you?,"Here's a screenshot of the commit I just made to fix a bug that I hunted literally four hours.

https://preview.redd.it/z9ndje1u0jr51.png?width=2259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e39af40d49cb1a25823eba35c05b6658e6ff374d

As you can see, the fix was five lines, practically just copy-paste the method below. [Commit is here.](https://github.com/kleinesfilmroellchen/sof-language/commit/77c9c9d9c7958fec99fb148617305e5e6593ea25)

The rant in text form:

&gt;Last commit switched over the Nametable backing map implementation from TreeMap to HashMap. TreeMap is always aware of the key and value types (in this case, Identifier and Stackable respectively). Therefore, when it needs to compare keys when retrieving/inserting/moving values, it calls key1.equals(key2). Because both key1 and key2 are typed as Identifier (generic type K in the actual source), Java picks a correct equals() override to invoke. In my case, all Stackable subtypes have an equals(Stackable) implemented (because Stackable is an interface and cannot override the Object inherited method equals(Object) ). And because Identifier is an implementor of Stackable, in the TreeMap equality check, Java will find that equals(Stackable) method and call it. Which is correct because it checks for the desired identifier name equality.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, for whatever reason, HashMap does at some point in its internal method chain forget the types of the objects. Despite it being a generic interface with type information always readily available. This means that by the time it does its equality checks (which, of course, are still required for many operations), it will consider key1 and key2 to be Objects. And call Object.equals(Object). Which I, unfortunately, hadn't implemented in Identifier. So the default check is basically pointer equality, which of course fails, and no key-value mapping is ever found again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks, Java.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I know to always implement Object.equals(Object) as well, just as this commit does for Identifier, which fixes everything. Sorry for breaking your stuff with the last commit. I really didn't see this one coming.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

(To be fully correct, TreeMap mostly uses the Comparator's compare() method, which is implemented by Identifier. But the point still stands.)

j640mb,Introduce a new filterMapped() method in stream API?,"Lately I'm stumbling more over lines like this one:

I'm wondering why there is no method like this:

    list.stream().filterMapped(Car::getModel, StringUtils::hasText). //...

This method essentially maps the object and then calls the referenced method on it without mapping the whole stream down (to String in this case).

I don't know if this is a good idea, but to me it appears to be more clean that way.

Another reason to at least learn how to do these things natively is because then you know how the frameworks do it and can understand if you really all those libraries for your task.

j28d43,[Hacktoberfest] We need Java developers for the MyLibreLab Free and Open Source software,"Hey folks, 

The month of October is ahead of us and there is a lot of excitement in the air among software developers. Everyone is rushing to get their hands on some nice FLOSS and get publicity, experience, and just pure joy of contribution! We have also a nice project that needs help.

MyLibreLab is a fork of the MyOpenLab software. It provides a visual programming environment, predominantly used to control microcontroller hardware such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.  It's an open-source alternative to LabVIEW. Check the [yet to be finished documentation](https://mylibrelab.github.io/user-documentation/).

We forked the MyOpenLab software quite a while ago because:

- The community has become a German and Spanish only one leaving the rest of the world out. Sadly the code base is also mostly documented in those languages.
- The core developer was hired by, guess who? National Instrument, the owner of the LabVIEW. Sadly the codebase was severely neglected after that.

We decided to give it a new life! We migrated from Sourceforge to GitHub, switched to Gradle, improved the project structure, and some cleanup, but the project still needs more love for our first release.

So, as title says, I'm senior java dev and I don't know theory. I don't know how, but I've been in 3 companies already, and successfully passed interviews in them. But before going to these companies, I also was trying to pass interviews in other companies and failing them. Every time after I've failed an interview, I've studied those topics at which I failed.

The problem is, I can't remember theory for a long time, and I keep forgetting it, especially if I don't use it. You can ask me a simple junior level question, and I'll sound like a trainee level developer.

I'm confident in my practical and analytical skills, my teammates and managers never had a problem with me and feedbacks are always on a level of ""meets/exceeds expectations"", and companies themselves are known companies, so it's not like ""Yeah, whatever. Let's take this random guy and give him good title""

But for the last few months, I had some kind of fear, that if I'll lose my job because of COVID-19, I might have a hard time finding a new one, because I suck at theory. I've tried to study it again, but a few days later, I just forget it again, and I have to reread everything over and over again.

The current version of XChart has zoom functionality built in but it would still need to be overridden to fit our needs (it zooms with x-axis coordinates only.) Or I can try to refactor our zoom customization to run more efficiently.

The bit of research I've done seems like JFreeChart is a front runner but it's lack of support over the last few years makes me weary. I've also come across ChartFX and JavaFX chart that seem promising.

Any advice/help going forward is much appreciated. Thank you!",11,java,2020-10-13

java.io.IOException: Could not determine a temporary executable directory.

&amp;#x200B;

What is frustrating, is we never get this error on the development side. QA cannot reproduce it. Only SOME of our clients have this issue.

After a lot of analysis, I believe it is because their anti-virus 'Trend Micro' is blocking the library from accessing the %appdata%/temp directory.

I have two questions:

1. Has someone had a similar experience, and if so was there a code change possible to prevent this?
2. Is there an alternative library to use for Java Swing desktop application which has similar functionality to CEF?

I wonder if there exists a list of books that any Java devs should read? Maybe we can create a list like this here?

To be precise it's not about that any Java dev should just read these books, but should have knowledge of this stuff which these books cover.

Of course, there will be classics as ""Effective Java"" by Joshua Bloch or ""Clean code"" by Robert C. Martin but maybe there are books that are less popular but very valuable?

Please give me your proposition.

My request is to include books about Spring (and other common frameworks) as well.

I’ve spent last half year working on a lightweight library for configuring a http client to communicate over tls/ssl. I have tested it with over [30+ http clients](https://github.com/Hakky54/sslcontext-kickstart#tested-http-clients) for java, scala and kotlin. The core library contains only one transitive dependency, slf4j-api, and the remaining part only uses the available classes within the jdk.

In the past I was required to configure a http client with different configurations depending on the project requirements, such as:

* One way authentication
* Two way authentication
* Using multiple truststores and keystores
* Using pem files

To make it easy to reuse for myself and everyone I thought it would be good to make a library out of it and also contribute back to the community. Hope you guys like it. Feel free to send my some critiques!

Lately, my company paid for a course about JavaEE 7 development.

Sadly, the course was only 40h long, and It barely scrached the surface of all the APIs it has to offer.

Anyway, there might be a chance for me, to get a voucher for the 1z0-900 certification exams.

I was pretty thrilled about It, and i'm not scared about the amount of stuff to study, but I'm a bit worried, since looks like there aren't many people talking about It. For example, I browsed reddit, and the only posts found about ""1z0-900"" were spam.

So, my questions are:


- Is this certification relevant? Or should I spend my time on something else?


- Why so few people talk about this cert?


- Can you suggest any kind of material Where to study for It?
(At the moment i'm blindly following the official Java EE7 tutorial, but I'm a practical learner, and I'd like some stuff with more examples Where to put my hands on)


- I've heard someone suggesting to read specific books about single APIs. In this case, i Guess there would be some APIs more important than others. which specification would you study deeper, and which one would you just skim through?

However, all this time I've been doing mostly Go development and had a major paradigm shift, limiting my dependencies and only choosing small libraries for certain tasks became intuitive for me.

After researching the state of current Java back-end development, I felt quite intimidated by the sheer amount of frameworks and dependencies that are being used even in small projects. I played around with Spring Initializr and the amount of ""unknown"" that I can pull is flustering.

I also should clarify that I'm not looking down on frameworks, I understand the benefits for people who regularly solve similar problems, especially in large teams.

If you've been following JavaFX, then you are aware that Gluon have made significant progress in cross-platform development, particularly for mobile.

Building on this success, the 11.11 release of the FXGL game engine brings seamless mobile support with little to no code change from the developer.

A full demo is available from the [original tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1304731964323307520)

The Breakout source (incl. sources of other popular titles) is available from [FXGLGames](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames#build-for-mobile) The repository also contains instructions on how to build to Android (if you are on Linux) or to iOS (if you are on Mac OS).

Given this is the first stable mobile-compatible release, the community feedback on the build process (and potential issues) is very valuable and much appreciated. These issues can be reported at [FXGL GitHub repo](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) where you can also, should you wish to, support the project development.

ir6ha3,Did I Make a Mistake? Introductory Coding in University Depressing Me...,"Hi guys,

Not asking for any specific programming help, just wanting some general advice and hoping to get a feel for whether or not I'm on the right path.

I'm a physics, economics and political science student at a university. I've had some trouble figuring out exactly what I want to do, because I'm interested in so much, hence the mixture.  This semester, I wanted to keep the possibility of switching one those majors to data science.

My university offers a data science degree, so I started taking one of its core courses, an introductory course for **Java**. The course not only opens the door to the data science degree, but can also lead into a few other really interesting majors I'd potentially consider.

At the moment, I'm trying to keep doors open instead of closing them. I'm going through this phase where I'm afraid to tie myself to one thing, because I've got so many interests, and because I'm afraid of making a wrong choice. I'm afraid of both being intellectually starved at my future job, and being without money in an increasingly rationalized economy. For a long time, I've dreamed of combining economics and physics, but watching millions lose their jobs has gotten fearful thoughts about the job market whirling up in my head, and I think that's also why my mind has been wandering off more and more to data science. It seems to lead to more safer, non-academic jobs; but I also understand that could be a misguided perception of things. After all, I'm still a student and I'm not out in the big wide world yet.

This introductory Java course is my first serious coding experience, meaning that, for the first time, I've had to code under a kind of pressure similar to that under which I've been doing physics, economics and political science.

And at the moment, I'm feeling really dumb and really exhausted.

This introductory Java course has been wearing me out much more than I expected, much more than my theoretical physics and quantitative economics courses. I'm trying to understand how much of this is fairly normal, how much of it could be because I'm possibly not cut out for coding, and how much of it is potentially due to the course itself.

The last three years, I've held a 4.0 GPA, but I'm thinking this course will probably end that streak. I don't mean to be obsessive about the GPA, I just didn't think that the course to end that streak would've been an introductory coding course. Hence my feeling really dumb.

The last few weeks, I've had to invest hours and hours into what I think should be fairly simple coding assignments. We're forced to use an auto-grader that is very strict and often very buggy. Most of the hours go into just trying to get the auto-grader to except the subission. The course book isn't really working for me either.

I've now considered withdrawing from the course without a grade. I'd have a withdrawal on my transcript, but I'm worried the time I'm losing for other courses isn't worth it. However, if I do withdraw, the doors to other potential majors with that course as a pre-requisite close for me.

I think it would help me get a perspective for things if I knew whether or not my difficulties are normal, and if so, how to best proceed. Does this experience sound similar to anyone else's? Anyone here have a rough start in coding? I'm still fairly new to it and don't yet feel like I know how to best approach it. How did you turn things around if you were initially having a tought time? What would you say are the clearest signs that I need to re-think my path and possibly withdraw?

Thanks for listening and stay well!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I'm touched so many people took the time to respond. Your responses have really helped me, everyone. Thank you so much. Looking at the majority of the comments, it seems like coding is just hard for most beginners. Your words are encouraging as it looks like the learning curve is simply steep, and even if that means stress and temporary anguish, I can deal with that. I've done it before. I used to be AWFUL at mathematics, C-ing and D-ing my way through school, until I was able to find out how I could best teach myself. I ended up being valedictorian (I couldn't believe it) and now I'm studying a subject I never thought I'd be able to even touch with a ten-foot pole and doing pretty well. 

I'm someone who avoids outward directed arrogance like the plague, but I admit I've had arrogant thoughts. And I think that's what happened here: I got cocky from previous success and thus, I approached programming from an arrogant mindset, as in ""How hard can it be? It's more practical, you push buttons, use pre-determined commands and you don't have to derive complex laws!"" 

I'm getting the kick in the ass I needed. Better now than later! In these last few days, I have gained a lot of respect for programmers and coders, much more than I ever had before. It's not only logically challenging, there is also a lot of creativity required. So many angles from which one can approach one problem! 

Anyway, thank you all very much for your time. I will keep grinding away at it!",47,java,2020-10-13
ir5ozw,Syncing Eclipse Across Multiple Computers,"Hello guys,

I am relatively new to programming. I am taking a java class for college this semester. I heard that you can sync Eclipse across multiple computers using Google Drive or other cloud storage services. I would like to try this with Drive but I can't find any good tutorials on here nor online. Any help? I appreciate any feedback.

Thanks.

EDIT: My friend was able to help me sync it using OneDrive. It was way easier than what I thought. All I had to do was download OneDrive on my desktop, move my workplace folder onto OneDrive, then switch the workplace to said workplace. I would recommend having the same versions of Eclipse and the JDK if you can. It will save you a lot of the trouble that I went through.",0,java,2020-10-13

iqw1ea,"How to add authorization (permissions, roles, etc.) in Java Apps","Hi all!

We've built an open source library for adding authorization (permissions, roles, etc.) to Java apps, called oso. You write policies using the oso policy language to govern who can do what inside your application, then you integrate them with a few lines of code using our library. Under the hood, it's a policy engine that's embedded in your application.

Roles are a common pattern to reach for when setting up permissions, but we've found that they're limited and can get clunky, so oso provides a language (called *Polar*) that's purpose-built for representing common domain concepts that can be useful like data ownership, hierarchies, relationships, etc.

You can use oso in any Java application, and we made a tutorial for using it in Spring Boot ([https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html](https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html)). You can follow along by cloning the example repository and trying it out: [https://github.com/osohq/oso-spring-tutorial](https://github.com/osohq/oso-spring-tutorial)

Edit: Please don't downvote without giving a reason.

Trying to start a discussion here.

Personally, I'm a (serious) C# developer and whenever I tell that to a Java dev I get an immediate negative reaction. I think this is based on C#'s history as a closed Window's only language. But a lot has changed since then. It's now cross-platform, and almost entirely open-source. There is a well designed set of tools for literally everything in .NET which makes it hard to convince me to give Java another try.

iocof5,JOOQ vs JPA,"So my experience with Java has been JDBC and JPA (Hibernate). JDBC is obviously super verbose, even with helpers like Spring Jdbc it's a pain to maintain. JPA, meanwhile, is the devil. I love how easy it is to maintain, but I'm constantly dealing with weird and inexplicable bugs, like the current one I'm struggling with where JPA is trying to delete a DB record on an update instead of updating it, thus causing constraint violations. I really hate all the weird shit that goes on behind the scenes with JPA. I also love SQL in terms of creating and managing my schema, I never use JPA to auto-generate it.

So I have been reading about JOOQ. It seems to have a lot going for it. It's a SQL DSL rather than an ORM, and the DSL appears to just make it easier to write type safe queries and (I hope) convert to Java classes from the tables. I'm just wondering how people feel about it. Is it less wonky than JPA or just have its own quirks? Are there any other tools for working with SQL and Java that I should consider?

PS. My job has been considering JPA alternatives for a while, but hasn't looked into it. Being able to work with a SQL schema file is essential because of multiple environment deployment.",44,java,2020-10-13

inol55,Does anyone else not like the non-sealed keyword?,"In the current version of sealed classes in Java 15, whenever you have a sealed class or interface, you declare which classes are permitted to extend or implement it.

```
public sealed interface Computer permits Laptop, Desktop, CellPhone {}
```

And then the classes which extend that sealed class must either declare that they are `final`, with no more extension allowed.

```
public final class Laptop implements Computer {}
```

That they are `sealed` again, meaning this subclass also has a restricted set of subclasses.

```
public sealed class Desktop implements Computer permits BudgetPC, GamingPC {}
```

Or that they are `non-sealed`, which means that they can be subclassed arbitrarily.

```
public non-sealed class CellPhone implements Computer {}
```

My issue is that in normal situations with java, `final` means ""No extension"" and no modifier already means ""arbitrary extension allowed"".

```
public class CellPhone implements Computer {}
```

So it would be unambiguous to just have no modifier at all.

While I understand that other JVM languages have trended towards final classes by default and requiring some sort of keyword like `open` to say that they are open for extension, the rest of Java does not have this behavior which makes this really stand out.

I know the language designers must have taken this into account and probably erred on the side of making people explicitly choose the behavior they want, but as much of a bikeshed as it is I really wish the language maintained symmetry.

I guess it is comforting that unlike most things in Java one could dislike there is time for this to change if other people feel the way I do and express that to the language team, but I kinda want to get a read on how other people feel.",29,java,2020-10-13

## Some history

In February 2020, right before the whole COVID-19 mess started, I decided it was time to try something new in my career - developing my own product. Since 2009, I always worked as a freelance consultant on different software projects but never developed a real product for end customers. Most of my projects where business applications making life easier for employees of different companies.

When I initially started my career (somewhere in 2004), I found that open-source world was mostly only happening in Java - the complete .NET world was still in it's infancy and there did not exist a lot of open-source projects for C#. And due to my job choices at that moment, I continued developing in the Java and Android world.

Fast forward to 2015 where I worked as a freelance consultant and did some pre-sales for a customer of a company where I consulted that really wanted to have it's software developed in C#. Since I provided the estimates for this project, I also wanted to work on it as I did not want to be the guy who just gave some (way to optimistic) estimates and then moved along. No, I wanted to see whether the numbers I gave also worked out.

As I only developed in Java like languages until 2015 and the customer insisted on Microsoft products, it was time to learn some C# and the whole eco-system of the .NET world. And wauw, did that change since 2004. They did not only have a lot more IoC frameworks - 11 in .NET vs 3 or 4 in Java (the famous ones are Spring and Guice), there were some frameworks like [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) and [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/) with which I really fell in love and that did not exist in the Java world. As soon as I understood the advantage of these frameworks, I always told my colleague's that I would port them to Java someday.

## Fast-forward to 2019/2020

I was consulting on a Java project where the developers again made their own Java version of Hangfire (but without retries and monitoring) and I thought about the promise I made to port Hangfire to Java. Initially, I didn't think it was possible as a lambda in .NET can be easily analysed as an Expression which is not possible in Java. But, thanks to some digging and learning the inner-bits of the JVM bytecode, I found [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) which allowed me to analyse a Java 8 lambda and find all the necessary information to create the Java version of Hangfire. I then contacted [Sergei Odinokov](https://twitter.com/odinserj), the creator of Hangfire to ask him if it was ok to do so and luckily enough I quickly got his blessing and some excellent tips too.   
So, in February 2020 I started on my adventure to create the Java port of Hangfire and developed it using all the best practices I learned over the years (with some breaks due to working from home and having kids off-course). I often thought that I made a big mistake to give up my work as a freelance developer - I was sure that with the current Corona recession, I would have a lot of trouble to find a new job. We have some savings but this is not something I can do for years. Nevertheless, there was no immediate way back so the only way is forward.

## First release in April 2020

On April 8th, I released the first beta on JCenter for other people to test - ***Hello JobRunr!*** And, after some posts on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/java-batch-processing-made-easy-ronald-dehuysser/) about the first release, I started to receive feedback and some small bugs which I was able to fix quickly. Soon, some new [feature requests](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/22) came in and since I really liked the business model that Sergei used for Hangfire I thought about doing the same. But, the Java world is a totally different beast than the .NET world - the Java open-source eco-system is so large with all kind of great products that developers aren't used to pay for a library, ***me myself included***. But, no risk - no fun, let's just try it and see what happens!

## May 2020

## creating a community

Since users have questions that are not always bugs or feature requests, I looked into tools for this purpose. As [Gitter](https://gitter.im/jobrunr/community) is available by default for each GitHub repository, I ended up choosing it and reached out to some people that had questions. While some contact worked out nicely (I supported a really large number of users through it - *4 in total* 🙂), I still have my doubts about Gitter - I think the barrier is quite big and my guess is that Discourse would be a better option.

On the website, I also explicitly mention [StackOverflow with a custom tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=java%20jobrunr) but up to today, all questions came in via GitHub issues. I get actively notified about questions on JobRunr on StackOverflow but for some unknown reason, it is not working today.

## the Google Ads attempt

Since I'd loved to get the word out about JobRunr, I used some free Google Ads credit and monitored the visitors on the website. The number of visitors increased significantly but for some reason, the ads where mostly only shown to Indian visitors and it did not have a big effect on the amount of JobRunr users. Even after changing the regional settings for my ads, nothing really happened and I did not notice an increase in the amount of users for JobRunr (there were no extra questions in Gitter nor any new bugs or feature requests on GitHub). Since I did not want to spend any money on Google Ads, I stopped the Google Ads campaign.

## the first release on Maven Central and a post on Reddit

Since I received positive feedback from some users using it, I decided it was time to release it on Maven Central and as I heard that other dev's had good experience with blogging on Reddit, I wrote a [post about JobRunr in the Java community](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/gs4l50/jobrunr_available_in_maven_central/) \- and wauw, I received some wonderful feedback, traffic to the website peaked (see the peak in the google analytics image right before June) and the [GitHub stars](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/stargazers) jumped from 20 something to over 50. When publishing a Jar on Maven Central, you can also see some basic statistics and I quickly saw that I reached about 19 users (19 unique ip's) with JobRunr.

## June, July and August 2020

I continued improving JobRunr and added support for all kinds of SQL and NoSQL databases. I blogged about how to use it with [Kubernetes](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/blog/2020-05-06-jobrunr-kubrnetes-terraform/) and how I took [testing seriously](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/blog/2020-06-01-testing-against-12-jvms/). I tried to get the word out using [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/h8ymvd/jobrunr_v098_available_in_maven_central/), LinkedIn and Twitter and saw a small but steady increase of happy users. I also continued to work on the Pro version of JobRunr adding extra features which I loved myself in the past and which were requested by end-users. The number of visitors always increased when I blogged about JobRunr on either [DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/jobrunr-project-loom-and-virtual-threads) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@ronald.dehuysser/a-hands-on-tutorial-on-how-to-test-against-12-different-jvms-using-testcontainers-by-google-bcb2ceaeaa69) but on a typical day, I have about 5 to 15 unique visitors. The number of unique downloads of JobRunr also continues to rise according to the Maven Central statistics.

## Where are we in September 2020

Currently, I feel quite confident that there are no major bugs present anymore in JobRunr. I did thorough testing (unit, integration and end-to-end with Cypress.io and I also test JobRunr against 12 different JVM's.) I still want to add support for [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/), which allows me to support the top 9 most used databases with JobRunr, including Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, MySql, MariaDB and also NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Redis.

So, September will see the release of JobRunr v1.0 and I just updated the site with information about the [Pro version](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/).

## Some lingering questions

Currently, there are quite some questions lingering in my mind:

* ***do I imagine that the market for JobRunr is bigger than it really is?***   
I think that any larger java application could benefit from using JobRunr - the moment there is some heavy processing (like generating a document, firing of a web-hook which might fail, ...), I really think there is an added advantage for JobRunr. It is that reason why I was so happy with Hangfire. There are already a lot of distributed real-time streaming products like [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) but in my eyes, JobRunr tries to solve a different problem and I still see a market share for it.
* ***are there perhaps already too many alternatives present?***   
I came quite late to the distributed background job processing party - there is already [Quartz](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/), [Spring @scheduled](https://spring.io/guides/gs/scheduling-tasks/), [Spring Batch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch) and [db-scheduler](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler). Yet, I think JobRunr still adds a lot of value as, in my eyes, it so easy to use, to setup and the dashboard gives easy insights for both developers and perhaps even business users. But, developers go with the libraries they know and since each of these libraries already have a well-established community so it will be difficult to convince them to use JobRunr.
* ***is JobRunr known by enough developers?***   
this is something I struggle with: I write blog posts about JobRunr for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/rdehuyss/posts/), [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/912925/rdehuyss.html), [Medium](https://medium.com/@ronald.dehuysser) and [Jaxenter](https://jaxenter.com/jobrunr-jvm-172830.html) \- all my preferred resources to stay up-to-date on the latest in tech. Still, I think I only reached about a couple of 1000 developers (if it is even that many) while there are [9,007,346 java developers](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+java+developers) and for the moment, I don't have a clue on how to reach these other developers.
* ***do developers and companies want to pay for freemium software?***   
this might also be a problem - we all got used to excellent software libraries without paying for it - it's part of the open-source movement which I off-course like. I could also perhaps setup some consulting around JobRunr but I don't think that will make me a living either.
* ***does the Pro version add enough value for the money? Is the annual licensing a good choice?***  
this is something I do not know for the moment and since I did not get any feedback on licensing yet (neither positive nor negative) it is something that only time will tell. I do think that the different features of JobRunr Pro like [Queues](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/queues/), [Batches](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/batches/) and [Job Chaining](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/job-chaining/) add a lot of value. And, if I compare it to the time spent developing these features combined with my rate as a freelance developer, I think the price is more than reasonable.

## Preliminary conclusion

My gut feeling says it will be difficult to make a living out of JobRunr. To be completely open, I off-course did not sell any license up until now. I do know there is interest of one company for the Pro version but the management still needs to be convinced.

What it did do however is perhaps worth more - I learned a lot of new and cool stuff:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) which is used by the frontend,
* [Drone.io](https://drone.io/) which is a Docker based CI/CD platform I use for JobRunr
* [Hugo CMS](https://gohugo.io) which is used for the website

And, on top of that, several people contacted me with job opportunities (some of which really interesting) and it's good to know that I can fall back on something in these economical difficult times.

ilt5mm,"Spring, Hibernate &amp; DTO's: When to map associations?","Imagine a straight forward Spring Boot application with an API for 'Products'. Each Product can have multiple 'Tags', mapped by a many-to-many relation in Hibernate on the entities.

A Product has an ID, name and some other fields. A Tag also has an ID and name. The join table between them has both IDs.

Imagine a `POST /products` call as follows, which will be handled by a straight forward controller-service-repository chain:

```
{
  ""name"": ""keyboard"",
  ""tags"": [""electronics"", ""computer""]
}
```

Because we're good people, we'd like to use DTOs on the Controller side and not expose the DB entities directly.

Now, *somewhere* we need to lookup the Tags from the DB for the given String inputs. However, here I get stuck on what the best practice is to achieve this:

* Preferably the DTOs stay with the _controllers_ and don't 'leak' into the _services_. The conversion is done in the controller. This means that any converter we employ would need to do this String-to-DB-entity lookup which seems wrong to do on the _controller_ level.
* Alternatively, the DTO could be passed into the _service_ where the converter business logic lives for looking up the Tags by name as part of the 'create' action. But this is rather verbose and creates a tight coupling between DTO and service that should be avoided imho
* When _not_ using DTOs but the Entities directly, the many-to-many association can be annotated with `@JsonIdentityInfo` and a reference to an `ObjectIdResolver` implementation that does this lookup (i.e. by having the Tag repository injected). This works nicely...but does not work when you want to use DTO's. Also annotating Entities with Jackson annotations feels wrong.

What's your approach to these challenges? I was surprised to not find any concensus or best practice on something as common and elementary as this.

For bonus points, let's say you want to apply some business logic to the lookup as well. For example, if the given 'tag' does not exist yet, you want to create it. Will that change your approach?",17,java,2020-10-13

However SpringBoot is lacking in some areas for full stack development.

* Thymeleaf seems to be no longer maintained. Anyone have experience with other libs?
* No solution for the new idea of websocket rendering logic, see [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)/[StimulusReflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/)
* Have to give ergonomics of the tooling to Rails, was really surprised to see that there is no 'rails routes', 'rails generate model', 'rails db:migrate' etc

I really want to choose Java because of its type safety which I value a lot. But it seems I should probably choose Rails for its developer ecosystem with respect to creating web apps. 

It seems the mindset in SpringBoot is mostly to create the backend API then throw an overkill React/Angular app on top.

It’s still in development, some parts only support maven and Java8, but I plan to remove these limitations eventually. Still, I’ve been using it daily for more than a month now, and it usually works fine, so I figured it’s time for a first release.

I’ve set it to run every time I save a file, and it has made my life much easier. Hopefully someone else can find use in it! It’s full of rough edges, so any bug report, request or simple feedback would be appreciated.

Tried to build something to make sure that the benefits are real even for non-toy applications with JPA and other factors involved; built a Blogging application (management and Front end) using Quarkus ecosystem.

Overall, easy, fun to write and really fast, would love to use in Production soon.

Java code:

```
if(person.getName() = “jan”) {return true;}
```

My answer was the following:

1. If `person` is `null`, you'll get an NPE

2. Using `=` is wrong, even `==` is wrong for strings, we don't look for the same reference but for the same value, equals would be adequate here like this: `""jan"".equals(person.getName())`

3. Something like `person.getName()` is rarely always lowercase, folks enter these sorts of things manually when they sign up. What if it's ""Jan"" instead or ""JAN""? Should we return true then?

4. What kind of user experience drives the design here? Why return true for a specific name?

ih5cl8,Why are checked exceptions frowned upon?,"AFAIK the following opinions are widespread in the programming community:

* Exceptions should be used for *exceptional* situations only, which generally means all that breaks the program's logic, but never as a control instruction. Sniff test: If your program can meaningfully handle the exception and then continue, you should not use an exception, since the situation is sensible in terms of your program logic. If a condition requires your program to crash (eg: out of memory error, bug detected at runtime such as assertion failure), then the situation is exceptional and it may be right to throw an exception.
* In cases that are not meaningless from the point of view of the logic of your program, when you might be tempted to use an exception (eg: file missing, invalid user input, etc), you should use some other language feature instead, one that provides type safety. Examples: Try pattern (cumbersome in Java due to the lack of `out` variables), `Optional`, some variation of `Either` (requires third party libraries in Java, or a poor man's solution in the form of a tuple).
* Checked exceptions in Java are a Bad Thing and Java programmers hate them.

I'm having trouble in understanding the underlying principles. (1) Exceptions are Evil because they throw away type safety (you have to remember yourself to catch all exceptions) (2) Checked exceptions are Evil.

But checked exceptions bring type safety to exceptions!

The advice to use some variation of the `Either` pattern instead of exceptions especially confuses me, since `Either` is, in fact, isomorphic to checked exceptions. 

Why are checked exceptions frowned upon and why are facilities like some variation of `Either` recommended instead?",75,java,2020-10-13

While solving two related problems we had at work, I've created two open-source libraries that solve those problems for us.

The problems are:

1. When appending additional context information to log messages (via MDC), how to ensure that the information stays relevant or is removed otherwise?
1. When logging is relevant for statistics, alerting etc., it should be tested. How can this be done easily in unit/integration tests?

So we've used these libraries intensively for over a year now and continue to maintain them. Since we made them open source, I'd be very happy to 

1. See some adoption in case I've created something actually useful :-)
1. Get some feedback on the usefulness and usability of those libs (or their documentation)

I'm new to the community and just finished up a few hours of learning Java tonight. So far I've logged 47.5 hours into learning Java in the last couple of weeks. I use an Excel document to track. Currently learning from a Udemy course and supplementing it with JetBrains Academy. 

After spending nearly 50 hours in learning Java, I find that I spend alot of time thinking about how someone else will read my code. Even when I do learn a more concise way of doing things, I'll usually sacrifice the few extra key strokes for the readability. Jet Brains Academy has been keeping me in check as far as whitespace goes. As a beginner and reading other people's code, I see alot of one line statements that are confusing to follow, even after looking things up in the Oracle documentation. Maybe once I spend more time with the language it'll be easier to follow and make more sense.

My question is, where is the line that you draw in conciseness vs readability. Is it all just preference? I've played guitar for over 10 years, and know the importance of establishing good habits from the start. What is best practice for someone learning?

iby2j4,Java as a first programming language,"Hello guys!

I am studying a computing and IT degree (software route), and it looks like they have picked Java as the main programming language.

They showed us a little bit of Python before (where they told us how popular Python is), but now we have an entire module for Java.

My question is: it looks like the most popular languages out there are Python and JavaScript. So, do you think Java is still a good choice?

I know the opinion of users in this community will be a bit biased, but I was just curious about what can I still do with Java, and if it’s still relevant and used in today’s world, etc.

Best in mind that I’m pretty new programming, etc.

Thanks I’m advance",75,java,2020-10-13

For those that have never done this, its usually done by hand using expensive and time consuming adobe products or open source tools like GIMP(this is what I usually use). 

I ended up falling upon this framework called Marvin image processing. Now, I'll be the first to admit the results were just ok. Not something you'd use in a production environment. But it does other cool stuff like edge detection and merging of photos. So I appreciate the effort the developer put into this tool and making it freely available.

ibj2ua,"JobRunr, Project Loom and Virtual Threads","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/81qrjhbqolh51.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c20a601e8e803662c7bbcb399f8ffbe43bee5f

JDK 16 early access has a build available including Project Loom which is all about virtual, light-weight threads (also called Fibers) that can be created in large quantities, without worrying about exhausting system resources.

Project Loom is also the reason why I did not use a reactive framework for JobRunr as it will change the way we will write concurrent programs. Project Loom with it's Virtual Threads is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for the existing threading framework and I tried it out using JobRunr today. This also means that JobRunr, as of v0.9.16 (to be released soon), will support project Loom out-of-the-box while still also supporting every JVM since Java 8!

Implementing support for Project Loom was easier than I thought using a `ServiceLoader`. I extracted a simple interface called `JobRunrExecutor` from the existing `ScheduledThreadPool`.

    public interface JobRunrExecutor extends Executor {
    
        int getPriority();
        
        void start();
        
        void stop();
    }

I then created another implementation of the interface using JDK 16 making use of Project Loom which does nothing more than delegating to a Virtual Thread:

    public class VirtualThreadJobRunrExecutor implements JobRunrExecutor {
    
        private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(VirtualThreadJobRunrExecutor.class);
        
        @Override
        public int getPriority() {
            return 5;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void start() {
            LOGGER.info(""JobRunrExecutor of type 'VirtualThreadJobRunrExecutor' started"");
        }
        
        @Override
        public void stop() {
            // nothing to do
        }
        
        @Override
        public void execute(Runnable runnable) {
            Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable);
        }
    
    }

Using a standard `ServiceLoader` I was able to inject the `VirtualThreadJobRunrExecutor` thus adding support for Virtual Threads!

    private JobRunrExecutor loadJobRunrExecutor() { 
        ServiceLoader&lt;JobRunrExecutor&gt; serviceLoader = ServiceLoader.load(JobRunrExecutor.class); 
        return stream(spliteratorUnknownSize(serviceLoader.iterator(), Spliterator.ORDERED), false)
           .sorted((a, b) -&gt; compare(b.getPriority(), a.getPriority()))
           .findFirst()
           .orElse(new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(serverStatus.getWorkerPoolSize(), ""backgroundjob-worker-pool"")); 
    } 

With all this in place, it was time to test and see if performance is better.

# Performance showdown: Java 11 vs Java 16 without Virtual Threads vs Java 16 with Virtual Threads

As I want to make sure performance is as good as it gets, I have some end-to-end tests which I run regularly, which can be found in the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/jobrunr/example-salary-slip](https://github.com/jobrunr/example-salary-slip). In that project, paychecks are generated for 2000 employees using a Word template and then transformed to PDF.

To compare Java 11, Java 16 and Java 16 with Virtual Threads, I ran this project again and hooked up JVisualVM. To give the JVM some time to warm up, I ran each test 3 times.

Comparing performances is not fair as JobRunr only checks for new jobs every 15 seconds and thus comparing these numbers just depends on the fact when I enqueued the jobs. Just to be complete, you can find the numbers below:

|Run|Java 11|Java 16|Java 16 with Loom|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|140|146|151|
|2|132|167|139|
|3|139|167|137|

All numbers are in seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

What we can compare is the results from JVisualVM. And boy, are these worthwhile!

## 

## The biggest difference is memory usage:

* JDK 11 occupied a heap of 6.8 GB with a peak use of 4.7 GB
* JDK 16 without Virtual Threads occupied a heap of 4.6 GB with a peak use of 3.7 GB
* JDK 16 with Virtual Threads occupied a heap of 2.7 GB with a peak use of 2.37 GB

So, using JDK 16 with these light-weight virtual threads resulted in:

* only 50% usage of heap memory compared to JDK 11
* only 64% usage of heap memory compared to JDK 16 without virtual threads

# Conclusion

While I initially thought that Project Loom would increase performance a lot, I currently see major improvements in memory usage. I was surprised as how easy it was to support Project Loom thanks to the use of the `ServiceLoader`. The source code for this article is off-course available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jobrunr/example-salary-slip/tree/loom).

Do note that JDK 16 is an early-access build and it's not even sure if Project Loom will be part of JDK 16.

I have historically used something like a queue (Active MQ, Rabbit MQ, etc..) and Camel to orchestrate processing of these submissions to allow for buffering and async processing.

This process does work, but is rather application-centric and doesn't address other issues that can come up in the configuration. I was considering other framework, but do need something that would work well with spring-based applications. When I receive an event I may need to look up other associated data via my spring data-based services, and cascade out through other parts of the ecosystem. 

I do use Hazelcast so was considering maybe Jet, but I'm not sure if this is a good fit for my model. I've also seen the Spring Cloud Data Flow project, but haven't tried anything hands on yet.

[I started development of a Microsoft Access conversion tool for developers](https://archived.forum.manjaro.org/t/about-a-microsoft-access-implementation-i-developed-for-the-linux-community/103051) using Java and the [Jackcess Library](https://jackcess.sourceforge.io/) as part of a summer project to get various ""Problem Programs"" I wanted in Linux working. By ""Problem Programs"" I mean notoriously non-supported features, applications, file formats, etc. in Linux or anywhere outside of Windows. You can find the source code for the project [here](https://github.com/AutoUpdatingBSoD/FOSS-MSAccess-Conversion-Tool).

I'll probably start to pick up development for it again soon, as I last left it in early development stages. Works fine right now if all you want is a straight dump to and from a text file for any MS Access version on the market, but not much beyond that works.

I'll probably cross-post in relevant subreddits as applicable. I just want to get the word out that yes you can semi-use Microsoft Access files of all types on Linux (including raspberry pi!) now without paying a dime (and have been for a while!)

Our security team recommended to put the various older versions (these are public releases) each on their own Virtual Machine and isolate/harden it on the network.

I was thrown into this recently and have been struggling to make sense of the licensing and if it even applies to the public versions we will be using. I've also heard that if you put Oracle Java in your virtual environment (say, a VMware host) then you would potentially need to license that entire host and all VMs on it. However I believe an Oracle Database was only mentioned, and we wouldn't be using this. The use case would only be for end users accessing a website or using an application that has Oracle Java built into it.

Is this true for putting a public version of Oracle Java in a virtual environment? Or can we safely put the various versions we need onto their own virtual machines and secure them?

----

It's clear from dozens of comment threads in several recent posts ([*here*](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/hyxnpu/finalizing_in_jdk_16_records/fzieom0/) and [*here*](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/i5c8wl/how_much_of_new_java_software_is_written_using/g0ohk61/) *for example*) that there is a lot of confusion, conflation and contradiction of what ""*LTS*"" really, truly means. I know it's confusing AF to me anyway.

For me at least, the key to clearing up the confusion, is to try to figure out:

1. How long is *Long-term* in ""*LTS*"" terms?
2. Who is Oracle pitching ""*LTS*"" to?
3. What does the ""*support*"" in ""*Long-Term Support*"" cover?
4. Is Adopt's, Amazon's, BellSoft's, etc. ""*LTS*"" the same as Oracle's ""*LTS*""?

----

\#***1***: The answer to my *Q1* is in two parts: 

* You can buy [***Premier Support***](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) from Oracle to get five years ""*LTS*"" (*until 2023 for JDK 11*)  
* And for ""***an additional fee***"" you can buy [***Extended Support***](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) and get three additional years (*until 2026 for JDK 11*)

I interpret Oracle's *Lifetime Support* docs to mean that the shortest duration of ""*LTS*"" is five years(*?*) But, confusingly, the answer to Oracle's [***Q7***](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/update-and-faq-on-the-java-se-release-cadence) bundles those two *distinct* support durations together with:

&gt;&gt; [*JDK*] *11 will have* ***commercial support*** *from Oracle available for at least eight additional years*

----

\#***2***: I emphasized ***commercial support*** just then because this other part of Oracle's ***Q7*** answer offers a clue for my *Q2*:

&gt;&gt; *so that we can focus on the needs of our customers*

I read those ***commercial support*** and ***our customers*** parts of their answer to mean that Oracle is pitching their ""*LTS*"" at their ***paying customers***.

So it seems clear enough, to me at least, that if you're not a ***paying*** customer of Oracle or some other vendor, then you are ***not*** getting five *Premier* years, nor „*eight additional years*“ of support for JDK 11.

----

\#***3***: The answer to my *Q3* is in the wording of Oracle's [***Q7***](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/update-and-faq-on-the-java-se-release-cadence)

&gt;&gt; *stability updates, performance updates and security updates*

Oracle's page on their [***Premier Support***](https://www.oracle.com/support/premier/software/) lists the things it bills as „*Comprehensive Software Support*“. 

If money's no object, [***Extended Support for Java SE***](https://www.oracle.com/us/assets/057419.pdf) buys you three additional years of „*Bug fixes, security fixes and minor updates*“, „*Upgrade tools*“ and „*Assistance with service requests 24 hours per day, 7 days a week*“ among other things.

----

\#***4***: I haven't looked into each OpenJDK vendor's definition of their ""*LTS*"" offering. But I did briefly look into [*Amazon's Corretto*](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/hyxnpu/finalizing_in_jdk_16_records/fzi5zmb/). From [*the reply I got*](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/hyxnpu/finalizing_in_jdk_16_records/fzi650k/) from the extraordinarily knowledgeable /r/Java poster /u/pron98, I for one, can't help but suspect that some OpenJDK vendors are either intentionally or unknowingly capitalizing on our confusion over what ""*LTS*"" actually means.

Once again, Oracle's ***Q7*** answer is crucial to understanding what Oracle means my ""*LTS*"":

&gt;&gt; *once Oracle* ***stops contributing our source code changes to a particular release series in OpenJDK***, *so that we can* ***focus on the needs of our customers***, *other qualified contributors in* ***the OpenJDK Community may step in to continue to maintain the release series*** [*emphasis mine*]

I read that to mean: *Oracle has already stopped contributing source code changes to the JDK 11 release in OpenJDK...except for when such source code changes meet the needs of Oracle's* ***paying*** *customers...Nevertheless, Red Hat, Amazon, Adopt, whoever, may step in to continue to maintain OpenJDK 11*. 

----

So yeah, it is true that you don't have to pay to download, use and deploy the actual ***binaries*** for releases that Oracle (*and by extension, vendors like Adopt et. al.*) designates as ""*LTS*"".

***But*** if you want „***commercial support***“ then that is what you ***do*** have to pay for. 

Even with all the reading up on it I just did, ""*LTS*"" is still not 100% crystal clear to me yet. None of what I've interpreted above is intended to pretend I'm an expert on the subject. I'm not. 

What *is* clear is that ""*LTS*"" probably doesn't mean what a ton of people seem to think it means.

My intention is to start a discussion on the subject, to engage the collective knowledge of the Java community to help make it clearer to all of us.

So, if I've misinterpreted anything above, I'm hoping that somebody will correct me where I'm wrong. TIA.

i5oab3,How do you people use such a piece of shit as Gradle?,"Decided to try it, as it seems to be a modern Java build tool. Ok let's start (with kotlin &amp; gradle).

1) `brew install gradle` - it installs `openjdk` as a dependency, even though I already had HotSpot JDK installed, but ok, whatever.

2) `gradle init` - and my project is polluted with garbage - gradle.build (ok that one is expected) and also - gradlew, gradlew.bat, gradle/wrapper, config.something.gradle, properties.gradle, .gitattributes. WTF is that? Tiny build utility the whole point of which is to sit somewhere in background and don't interrupt me - that utility with the very first step - init - put tons of garbage in my project, and not in some dark corner of the project in hidden directory, but at the very top?!

3) Ok, I manually removed all that garbage, leaving only `gradle.build`, trying `gradle run` from the console - all good.

4) Time to connect with Intelij IDEA, creating/importing project. IDEA slowly thinking for a minute, then - regenerates all that gradle garbage again. All the gradle files I manually deleted - are now again in the project. IDEA re-generates that gradle garbage every time I manually delete it.

5) Ok after asking - some people told me that I need to change setting in IDEA so it will take gradle from predefined location. I changed - and it worked, for couple of minutes, until I updated gradle.build - and suddenly it became red in IDEA, all sorts of errors (still works fine from console).",0,java,2020-10-13

That's actually only one of [*a few that I came across*](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html#AppendixJAVA). 

So when my curiosity got the better of me, I searched to see if CVE-2020-14593 was mentioned in either [*the Mercurial repository*](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk14/log?rev=CVE-2020-14593) or [*GitHub*](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/search?q=CVE-2020-14593&amp;unscoped_q=CVE-2020-14593). No hits in either.

I also tried a couple other different keywords. [*Oracle's Risk Matrix*](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html#AppendixJAVA) mentioned ""*2D*"" in CVE-2020-14593's *Components* column.

There's no mention of anything that sounds like it in neither [*14.0.1's Release Notes*](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/14-0-1-relnotes.html) nor in [*14.0.2's*](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/14-0-2-relnotes.html).

What is `MIZU`? It is a web app to visualize algorithms and data structure routines live on screen. The user will be able to see the transformations and data movements , real-time, as it responds to user commands.

It goes live in september.

&amp;nbsp;

[Github.](https://github.com/riziovo/mizuu)

&amp;nbsp;

I will post updates on the github repo as I work through the bulk of it.

Backend hosts the Server and the Algorithms library which power the simulations on the backend. This Algorithms library houses ADTs based on structures :
&gt; - Tree 
&gt; - Heap
&gt; - Trie
&gt; - Queue
&gt; - Stack
&gt; - List
&gt; - Graph



All of the ADTs in this library are my own implementations. As a function of being an interactive visualizer, the simulations on user side are real-time, not pre-rendered.


### Backend Tech

* [ZeroMQ] - Message Queues and Services Orchestration of worker threads for simulation
* [Java] - Backend is based on a Java ecosystem
* [NodeJS] - Websockets proxy relay
* [Redis] - session and caches


### Frontend Tech

* [HTML5] - UI
* [CSS3] - UI

- HIGH PRIORITY : Fix margins so nodes do not overlap

-  HIGH PRIORITY : For every user operation -&gt; highlight, with a specific color, the node and element the Btree is acting upon, through which the end-user has a fair idea of the current flow of events.

- Remedy the issue of branches staying a step too long at dead spots

- Make transitions smoother. No cutscenes in between (Maybe add an inorganic hack with an animation step...?)

- Fix text-centering inside Nodes

- Labelling is bad... Improve it

So I am currently in training for a junior developer position.

j9mv3x,.toUUID(): A tiny library for generating human-readable UUIDs for automated tests,"We often use UUIDs where I work, which is fine, but UUIDs is a pain to deal with when you have to create them in tests:

* Creating UUIDs look ugly
* Creating UUIDs takes up a lot of space
* Creating UUIDs decrease the readability.

This might all be minor gripes I have, but I like my tests to be short and clean.

The most common way to generate a human-readable UUID is doing the following:

`UUID.fromString(""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"");`

If you use .toUUID() you can get the same result like this:

`toUUID(1);`

There's also a few more bells and whistles like generating UUIDs based on a collection, varargs or a range of integers.

If you find yourself having to deal with UUIDs in automated tests, or you want to generate a set of simple UUIDs quickly, then .toUUID() might be up your alley: [https://github.com/atomfinger/toUUID](https://github.com/atomfinger/toUUID)

.toUUID() were initially made by me, for me, but if UUIDs annoy me, then it might annoy others as well.

*While this post has garnered a net-positive response in terms of up votes it has not been blessed with the same  positivity in the comments. The core issue, as I interpret it, is that people don't see the benefit of using this library compared to the current flow they are using, which clearly indicates that I haven't done a good enough job explaining this. I thought I had done a decent job (or made the false assumption that it was self evident), but it is obvious that I need to do better in this regard :) Again though, thanks for the feedback, it is appreciated.*",60,java,2020-10-13

j6bwoq,[Rant] Has this ever happened to you?,"Here's a screenshot of the commit I just made to fix a bug that I hunted literally four hours.

https://preview.redd.it/z9ndje1u0jr51.png?width=2259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e39af40d49cb1a25823eba35c05b6658e6ff374d

As you can see, the fix was five lines, practically just copy-paste the method below. [Commit is here.](https://github.com/kleinesfilmroellchen/sof-language/commit/77c9c9d9c7958fec99fb148617305e5e6593ea25)

The rant in text form:

&gt;Last commit switched over the Nametable backing map implementation from TreeMap to HashMap. TreeMap is always aware of the key and value types (in this case, Identifier and Stackable respectively). Therefore, when it needs to compare keys when retrieving/inserting/moving values, it calls key1.equals(key2). Because both key1 and key2 are typed as Identifier (generic type K in the actual source), Java picks a correct equals() override to invoke. In my case, all Stackable subtypes have an equals(Stackable) implemented (because Stackable is an interface and cannot override the Object inherited method equals(Object) ). And because Identifier is an implementor of Stackable, in the TreeMap equality check, Java will find that equals(Stackable) method and call it. Which is correct because it checks for the desired identifier name equality.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, for whatever reason, HashMap does at some point in its internal method chain forget the types of the objects. Despite it being a generic interface with type information always readily available. This means that by the time it does its equality checks (which, of course, are still required for many operations), it will consider key1 and key2 to be Objects. And call Object.equals(Object). Which I, unfortunately, hadn't implemented in Identifier. So the default check is basically pointer equality, which of course fails, and no key-value mapping is ever found again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks, Java.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I know to always implement Object.equals(Object) as well, just as this commit does for Identifier, which fixes everything. Sorry for breaking your stuff with the last commit. I really didn't see this one coming.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

(To be fully correct, TreeMap mostly uses the Comparator's compare() method, which is implemented by Identifier. But the point still stands.)

j28d43,[Hacktoberfest] We need Java developers for the MyLibreLab Free and Open Source software,"Hey folks, 

The month of October is ahead of us and there is a lot of excitement in the air among software developers. Everyone is rushing to get their hands on some nice FLOSS and get publicity, experience, and just pure joy of contribution! We have also a nice project that needs help.

MyLibreLab is a fork of the MyOpenLab software. It provides a visual programming environment, predominantly used to control microcontroller hardware such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.  It's an open-source alternative to LabVIEW. Check the [yet to be finished documentation](https://mylibrelab.github.io/user-documentation/).

We forked the MyOpenLab software quite a while ago because:

- The community has become a German and Spanish only one leaving the rest of the world out. Sadly the code base is also mostly documented in those languages.
- The core developer was hired by, guess who? National Instrument, the owner of the LabVIEW. Sadly the codebase was severely neglected after that.

We decided to give it a new life! We migrated from Sourceforge to GitHub, switched to Gradle, improved the project structure, and some cleanup, but the project still needs more love for our first release.

Both `U` and `? extends U` are covariant, meaning they can be specified as a sub type of themselves (in the case of `U`) or a sub type of their bound (in the case of `? extends U`). This is why, in your specific case the `? extends U` can be substituted for `U` and still work fine.

j0fizn,I'm a senior Java dev that sucks at theory and I need help (not a programming help),"Hello there!

So, as title says, I'm senior java dev and I don't know theory. I don't know how, but I've been in 3 companies already, and successfully passed interviews in them. But before going to these companies, I also was trying to pass interviews in other companies and failing them. Every time after I've failed an interview, I've studied those topics at which I failed.

The problem is, I can't remember theory for a long time, and I keep forgetting it, especially if I don't use it. You can ask me a simple junior level question, and I'll sound like a trainee level developer.

I'm confident in my practical and analytical skills, my teammates and managers never had a problem with me and feedbacks are always on a level of ""meets/exceeds expectations"", and companies themselves are known companies, so it's not like ""Yeah, whatever. Let's take this random guy and give him good title""

But for the last few months, I had some kind of fear, that if I'll lose my job because of COVID-19, I might have a hard time finding a new one, because I suck at theory. I've tried to study it again, but a few days later, I just forget it again, and I have to reread everything over and over again.

The software currently implements a two year old version of XChart with in house zooming functionality written to compensate for XChart's lacking at the time. Beyond zooming our GUI is essentially unusable because of the lag caused by XChart/In house zooming.

The current version of XChart has zoom functionality built in but it would still need to be overridden to fit our needs (it zooms with x-axis coordinates only.) Or I can try to refactor our zoom customization to run more efficiently.

The bit of research I've done seems like JFreeChart is a front runner but it's lack of support over the last few years makes me weary. I've also come across ChartFX and JavaFX chart that seem promising.

java.io.IOException: Could not determine a temporary executable directory.

&amp;#x200B;

What is frustrating, is we never get this error on the development side. QA cannot reproduce it. Only SOME of our clients have this issue.

After a lot of analysis, I believe it is because their anti-virus 'Trend Micro' is blocking the library from accessing the %appdata%/temp directory.

I have two questions:

1. Has someone had a similar experience, and if so was there a code change possible to prevent this?
2. Is there an alternative library to use for Java Swing desktop application which has similar functionality to CEF?

I have tested it with over [30+ http clients](https://github.com/Hakky54/sslcontext-kickstart#tested-http-clients) for java, scala and kotlin. The core library contains only one transitive dependency, slf4j-api, and the remaining part only uses the available classes within the jdk.

In the past I was required to configure a http client with different configurations depending on the project requirements, such as:

* One way authentication
* Two way authentication
* Using multiple truststores and keystores
* Using pem files

To make it easy to reuse for myself and everyone I thought it would be good to make a library out of it and also contribute back to the community. Hope you guys like it. Feel free to send my some critiques!

Lately, my company paid for a course about JavaEE 7 development.

Sadly, the course was only 40h long, and It barely scrached the surface of all the APIs it has to offer.

Anyway, there might be a chance for me, to get a voucher for the 1z0-900 certification exams.

I was pretty thrilled about It, and i'm not scared about the amount of stuff to study, but I'm a bit worried, since looks like there aren't many people talking about It. For example, I browsed reddit, and the only posts found about ""1z0-900"" were spam.

So, my questions are:


- Is this certification relevant? Or should I spend my time on something else?


- Why so few people talk about this cert?


- Can you suggest any kind of material Where to study for It?
(At the moment i'm blindly following the official Java EE7 tutorial, but I'm a practical learner, and I'd like some stuff with more examples Where to put my hands on)


- I've heard someone suggesting to read specific books about single APIs. In this case, i Guess there would be some APIs more important than others. which specification would you study deeper, and which one would you just skim through?

istulv,Is it viable to use Java (for back-end services) without frameworks?,"It's been a really long time since I've done any Java development, and I'm considering writing a new project in Java, mainly because I actually like the core language. However, all this time I've been doing mostly Go development and had a major paradigm shift, limiting my dependencies and only choosing small libraries for certain tasks became intuitive for me.

After researching the state of current Java back-end development, I felt quite intimidated by the sheer amount of frameworks and dependencies that are being used even in small projects. I played around with Spring Initializr and the amount of ""unknown"" that I can pull is flustering.

I also should clarify that I'm not looking down on frameworks, I understand the benefits for people who regularly solve similar problems, especially in large teams. I'm merely curious if it's viable to build web services with using a few specialized libraries and just plain old Java. Google didn't provide many resources, so I decided to ask the community over here.",23,java,2020-10-13

If you've been following JavaFX, then you are aware that Gluon have made significant progress in cross-platform development, particularly for mobile.

Building on this success, the 11.11 release of the FXGL game engine brings seamless mobile support with little to no code change from the developer.

A full demo is available from the [original tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1304731964323307520)

The Breakout source (incl. sources of other popular titles) is available from [FXGLGames](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames#build-for-mobile) The repository also contains instructions on how to build to Android (if you are on Linux) or to iOS (if you are on Mac OS).

Given this is the first stable mobile-compatible release, the community feedback on the build process (and potential issues) is very valuable and much appreciated. These issues can be reported at [FXGL GitHub repo](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) where you can also, should you wish to, support the project development.

ir6ha3,Did I Make a Mistake? Introductory Coding in University Depressing Me...,"Hi guys,

Not asking for any specific programming help, just wanting some general advice and hoping to get a feel for whether or not I'm on the right path.

I'm a physics, economics and political science student at a university. I've had some trouble figuring out exactly what I want to do, because I'm interested in so much, hence the mixture.  This semester, I wanted to keep the possibility of switching one those majors to data science.

My university offers a data science degree, so I started taking one of its core courses, an introductory course for **Java**. The course not only opens the door to the data science degree, but can also lead into a few other really interesting majors I'd potentially consider.

At the moment, I'm trying to keep doors open instead of closing them. I'm going through this phase where I'm afraid to tie myself to one thing, because I've got so many interests, and because I'm afraid of making a wrong choice. I'm afraid of both being intellectually starved at my future job, and being without money in an increasingly rationalized economy. For a long time, I've dreamed of combining economics and physics, but watching millions lose their jobs has gotten fearful thoughts about the job market whirling up in my head, and I think that's also why my mind has been wandering off more and more to data science. It seems to lead to more safer, non-academic jobs; but I also understand that could be a misguided perception of things. After all, I'm still a student and I'm not out in the big wide world yet.

This introductory Java course is my first serious coding experience, meaning that, for the first time, I've had to code under a kind of pressure similar to that under which I've been doing physics, economics and political science.

And at the moment, I'm feeling really dumb and really exhausted.

This introductory Java course has been wearing me out much more than I expected, much more than my theoretical physics and quantitative economics courses. I'm trying to understand how much of this is fairly normal, how much of it could be because I'm possibly not cut out for coding, and how much of it is potentially due to the course itself.

The last three years, I've held a 4.0 GPA, but I'm thinking this course will probably end that streak. I don't mean to be obsessive about the GPA, I just didn't think that the course to end that streak would've been an introductory coding course. Hence my feeling really dumb.

The last few weeks, I've had to invest hours and hours into what I think should be fairly simple coding assignments. We're forced to use an auto-grader that is very strict and often very buggy. Most of the hours go into just trying to get the auto-grader to except the subission. The course book isn't really working for me either.

I've now considered withdrawing from the course without a grade. I'd have a withdrawal on my transcript, but I'm worried the time I'm losing for other courses isn't worth it. However, if I do withdraw, the doors to other potential majors with that course as a pre-requisite close for me.

I think it would help me get a perspective for things if I knew whether or not my difficulties are normal, and if so, how to best proceed. Does this experience sound similar to anyone else's? Anyone here have a rough start in coding? I'm still fairly new to it and don't yet feel like I know how to best approach it. How did you turn things around if you were initially having a tought time? What would you say are the clearest signs that I need to re-think my path and possibly withdraw?

Thanks for listening and stay well!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I'm touched so many people took the time to respond. Your responses have really helped me, everyone. Thank you so much. Looking at the majority of the comments, it seems like coding is just hard for most beginners. Your words are encouraging as it looks like the learning curve is simply steep, and even if that means stress and temporary anguish, I can deal with that. I've done it before. I used to be AWFUL at mathematics, C-ing and D-ing my way through school, until I was able to find out how I could best teach myself. I ended up being valedictorian (I couldn't believe it) and now I'm studying a subject I never thought I'd be able to even touch with a ten-foot pole and doing pretty well. 

I'm someone who avoids outward directed arrogance like the plague, but I admit I've had arrogant thoughts. And I think that's what happened here: I got cocky from previous success and thus, I approached programming from an arrogant mindset, as in ""How hard can it be? It's more practical, you push buttons, use pre-determined commands and you don't have to derive complex laws!"" 

I'm getting the kick in the ass I needed. Better now than later! In these last few days, I have gained a lot of respect for programmers and coders, much more than I ever had before. It's not only logically challenging, there is also a lot of creativity required. So many angles from which one can approach one problem! 

Anyway, thank you all very much for your time. I will keep grinding away at it!",43,java,2020-10-13

iqw1ea,"How to add authorization (permissions, roles, etc.) in Java Apps","Hi all!

We've built an open source library for adding authorization (permissions, roles, etc.) to Java apps, called oso. You write policies using the oso policy language to govern who can do what inside your application, then you integrate them with a few lines of code using our library. Under the hood, it's a policy engine that's embedded in your application.

Roles are a common pattern to reach for when setting up permissions, but we've found that they're limited and can get clunky, so oso provides a language (called *Polar*) that's purpose-built for representing common domain concepts that can be useful like data ownership, hierarchies, relationships, etc.

You can use oso in any Java application, and we made a tutorial for using it in Spring Boot ([https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html](https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html)).

JPA, meanwhile, is the devil. I love how easy it is to maintain, but I'm constantly dealing with weird and inexplicable bugs, like the current one I'm struggling with where JPA is trying to delete a DB record on an update instead of updating it, thus causing constraint violations. I really hate all the weird shit that goes on behind the scenes with JPA. I also love SQL in terms of creating and managing my schema, I never use JPA to auto-generate it.

So I have been reading about JOOQ. It seems to have a lot going for it. It's a SQL DSL rather than an ORM, and the DSL appears to just make it easier to write type safe queries and (I hope) convert to Java classes from the tables. I'm just wondering how people feel about it. Is it less wonky than JPA or just have its own quirks? Are there any other tools for working with SQL and Java that I should consider?

PS. My job has been considering JPA alternatives for a while, but hasn't looked into it. Being able to work with a SQL schema file is essential because of multiple environment deployment.",44,java,2020-10-13

public sealed interface Computer permits Laptop, Desktop, CellPhone {}
```

And then the classes which extend that sealed class must either declare that they are `final`, with no more extension allowed.

```
public final class Laptop implements Computer {}
```

That they are `sealed` again, meaning this subclass also has a restricted set of subclasses.

```
public sealed class Desktop implements Computer permits BudgetPC, GamingPC {}
```

Or that they are `non-sealed`, which means that they can be subclassed arbitrarily.

```
public non-sealed class CellPhone implements Computer {}
```

My issue is that in normal situations with java, `final` means ""No extension"" and no modifier already means ""arbitrary extension allowed"".

```
public class CellPhone implements Computer {}
```

So it would be unambiguous to just have no modifier at all.

While I understand that other JVM languages have trended towards final classes by default and requiring some sort of keyword like `open` to say that they are open for extension, the rest of Java does not have this behavior which makes this really stand out.

I know the language designers must have taken this into account and probably erred on the side of making people explicitly choose the behavior they want, but as much of a bikeshed as it is I really wish the language maintained symmetry.

I guess it is comforting that unlike most things in Java one could dislike there is time for this to change if other people feel the way I do and express that to the language team, but I kinda want to get a read on how other people feel.",29,java,2020-10-13

## Some history

In February 2020, right before the whole COVID-19 mess started, I decided it was time to try something new in my career - developing my own product. Since 2009, I always worked as a freelance consultant on different software projects but never developed a real product for end customers. Most of my projects where business applications making life easier for employees of different companies.

When I initially started my career (somewhere in 2004), I found that open-source world was mostly only happening in Java - the complete .NET world was still in it's infancy and there did not exist a lot of open-source projects for C#. And due to my job choices at that moment, I continued developing in the Java and Android world.

Fast forward to 2015 where I worked as a freelance consultant and did some pre-sales for a customer of a company where I consulted that really wanted to have it's software developed in C#. Since I provided the estimates for this project, I also wanted to work on it as I did not want to be the guy who just gave some (way to optimistic) estimates and then moved along. No, I wanted to see whether the numbers I gave also worked out.

As I only developed in Java like languages until 2015 and the customer insisted on Microsoft products, it was time to learn some C# and the whole eco-system of the .NET world. And wauw, did that change since 2004. They did not only have a lot more IoC frameworks - 11 in .NET vs 3 or 4 in Java (the famous ones are Spring and Guice), there were some frameworks like [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) and [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/) with which I really fell in love and that did not exist in the Java world. As soon as I understood the advantage of these frameworks, I always told my colleague's that I would port them to Java someday.

## Fast-forward to 2019/2020

I was consulting on a Java project where the developers again made their own Java version of Hangfire (but without retries and monitoring) and I thought about the promise I made to port Hangfire to Java. Initially, I didn't think it was possible as a lambda in .NET can be easily analysed as an Expression which is not possible in Java. But, thanks to some digging and learning the inner-bits of the JVM bytecode, I found [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) which allowed me to analyse a Java 8 lambda and find all the necessary information to create the Java version of Hangfire. I then contacted [Sergei Odinokov](https://twitter.com/odinserj), the creator of Hangfire to ask him if it was ok to do so and luckily enough I quickly got his blessing and some excellent tips too.   
So, in February 2020 I started on my adventure to create the Java port of Hangfire and developed it using all the best practices I learned over the years (with some breaks due to working from home and having kids off-course). I often thought that I made a big mistake to give up my work as a freelance developer - I was sure that with the current Corona recession, I would have a lot of trouble to find a new job. We have some savings but this is not something I can do for years. Nevertheless, there was no immediate way back so the only way is forward.

## First release in April 2020

On April 8th, I released the first beta on JCenter for other people to test - ***Hello JobRunr!*** And, after some posts on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/java-batch-processing-made-easy-ronald-dehuysser/) about the first release, I started to receive feedback and some small bugs which I was able to fix quickly. Soon, some new [feature requests](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/22) came in and since I really liked the business model that Sergei used for Hangfire I thought about doing the same. But, the Java world is a totally different beast than the .NET world - the Java open-source eco-system is so large with all kind of great products that developers aren't used to pay for a library, ***me myself included***. But, no risk - no fun, let's just try it and see what happens!

## May 2020

## creating a community

Since users have questions that are not always bugs or feature requests, I looked into tools for this purpose. As [Gitter](https://gitter.im/jobrunr/community) is available by default for each GitHub repository, I ended up choosing it and reached out to some people that had questions. While some contact worked out nicely (I supported a really large number of users through it - *4 in total* 🙂), I still have my doubts about Gitter - I think the barrier is quite big and my guess is that Discourse would be a better option.

On the website, I also explicitly mention [StackOverflow with a custom tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=java%20jobrunr) but up to today, all questions came in via GitHub issues. I get actively notified about questions on JobRunr on StackOverflow but for some unknown reason, it is not working today.

## the Google Ads attempt

Since I'd loved to get the word out about JobRunr, I used some free Google Ads credit and monitored the visitors on the website. The number of visitors increased significantly but for some reason, the ads where mostly only shown to Indian visitors and it did not have a big effect on the amount of JobRunr users. Even after changing the regional settings for my ads, nothing really happened and I did not notice an increase in the amount of users for JobRunr (there were no extra questions in Gitter nor any new bugs or feature requests on GitHub). Since I did not want to spend any money on Google Ads, I stopped the Google Ads campaign.

## the first release on Maven Central and a post on Reddit

Since I received positive feedback from some users using it, I decided it was time to release it on Maven Central and as I heard that other dev's had good experience with blogging on Reddit, I wrote a [post about JobRunr in the Java community](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/gs4l50/jobrunr_available_in_maven_central/) \- and wauw, I received some wonderful feedback, traffic to the website peaked (see the peak in the google analytics image right before June) and the [GitHub stars](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/stargazers) jumped from 20 something to over 50. When publishing a Jar on Maven Central, you can also see some basic statistics and I quickly saw that I reached about 19 users (19 unique ip's) with JobRunr.

## June, July and August 2020

I continued improving JobRunr and added support for all kinds of SQL and NoSQL databases. I blogged about how to use it with [Kubernetes](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/blog/2020-05-06-jobrunr-kubrnetes-terraform/) and how I took [testing seriously](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/blog/2020-06-01-testing-against-12-jvms/). I tried to get the word out using [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/h8ymvd/jobrunr_v098_available_in_maven_central/), LinkedIn and Twitter and saw a small but steady increase of happy users. I also continued to work on the Pro version of JobRunr adding extra features which I loved myself in the past and which were requested by end-users. The number of visitors always increased when I blogged about JobRunr on either [DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/jobrunr-project-loom-and-virtual-threads) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@ronald.dehuysser/a-hands-on-tutorial-on-how-to-test-against-12-different-jvms-using-testcontainers-by-google-bcb2ceaeaa69) but on a typical day, I have about 5 to 15 unique visitors. The number of unique downloads of JobRunr also continues to rise according to the Maven Central statistics.

## Where are we in September 2020

Currently, I feel quite confident that there are no major bugs present anymore in JobRunr. I did thorough testing (unit, integration and end-to-end with Cypress.io and I also test JobRunr against 12 different JVM's.) I still want to add support for [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/), which allows me to support the top 9 most used databases with JobRunr, including Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, MySql, MariaDB and also NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Redis.

So, September will see the release of JobRunr v1.0 and I just updated the site with information about the [Pro version](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/).

## Some lingering questions

Currently, there are quite some questions lingering in my mind:

* ***do I imagine that the market for JobRunr is bigger than it really is?***   
I think that any larger java application could benefit from using JobRunr - the moment there is some heavy processing (like generating a document, firing of a web-hook which might fail, ...), I really think there is an added advantage for JobRunr. It is that reason why I was so happy with Hangfire. There are already a lot of distributed real-time streaming products like [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) but in my eyes, JobRunr tries to solve a different problem and I still see a market share for it.
* ***are there perhaps already too many alternatives present?***   
I came quite late to the distributed background job processing party - there is already [Quartz](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/), [Spring @scheduled](https://spring.io/guides/gs/scheduling-tasks/), [Spring Batch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch) and [db-scheduler](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler). Yet, I think JobRunr still adds a lot of value as, in my eyes, it so easy to use, to setup and the dashboard gives easy insights for both developers and perhaps even business users. But, developers go with the libraries they know and since each of these libraries already have a well-established community so it will be difficult to convince them to use JobRunr.
* ***is JobRunr known by enough developers?***   
this is something I struggle with: I write blog posts about JobRunr for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/rdehuyss/posts/), [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/912925/rdehuyss.html), [Medium](https://medium.com/@ronald.dehuysser) and [Jaxenter](https://jaxenter.com/jobrunr-jvm-172830.html) \- all my preferred resources to stay up-to-date on the latest in tech. Still, I think I only reached about a couple of 1000 developers (if it is even that many) while there are [9,007,346 java developers](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+java+developers) and for the moment, I don't have a clue on how to reach these other developers.
* ***do developers and companies want to pay for freemium software?***   
this might also be a problem - we all got used to excellent software libraries without paying for it - it's part of the open-source movement which I off-course like. I could also perhaps setup some consulting around JobRunr but I don't think that will make me a living either.
* ***does the Pro version add enough value for the money? Is the annual licensing a good choice?***  
this is something I do not know for the moment and since I did not get any feedback on licensing yet (neither positive nor negative) it is something that only time will tell. I do think that the different features of JobRunr Pro like [Queues](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/queues/), [Batches](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/batches/) and [Job Chaining](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/job-chaining/) add a lot of value. And, if I compare it to the time spent developing these features combined with my rate as a freelance developer, I think the price is more than reasonable.

## Preliminary conclusion

My gut feeling says it will be difficult to make a living out of JobRunr. To be completely open, I off-course did not sell any license up until now. I do know there is interest of one company for the Pro version but the management still needs to be convinced.

What it did do however is perhaps worth more - I learned a lot of new and cool stuff:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) which is used by the frontend,
* [Drone.io](https://drone.io/) which is a Docker based CI/CD platform I use for JobRunr
* [Hugo CMS](https://gohugo.io) which is used for the website

And, on top of that, several people contacted me with job opportunities (some of which really interesting) and it's good to know that I can fall back on something in these economical difficult times.

ilt5mm,"Spring, Hibernate &amp; DTO's: When to map associations?","Imagine a straight forward Spring Boot application with an API for 'Products'. Each Product can have multiple 'Tags', mapped by a many-to-many relation in Hibernate on the entities.

A Product has an ID, name and some other fields. A Tag also has an ID and name. The join table between them has both IDs.

Imagine a `POST /products` call as follows, which will be handled by a straight forward controller-service-repository chain:

```
{
  ""name"": ""keyboard"",
  ""tags"": [""electronics"", ""computer""]
}
```

Because we're good people, we'd like to use DTOs on the Controller side and not expose the DB entities directly.

Now, *somewhere* we need to lookup the Tags from the DB for the given String inputs. However, here I get stuck on what the best practice is to achieve this:

* Preferably the DTOs stay with the _controllers_ and don't 'leak' into the _services_. The conversion is done in the controller. This means that any converter we employ would need to do this String-to-DB-entity lookup which seems wrong to do on the _controller_ level.
* Alternatively, the DTO could be passed into the _service_ where the converter business logic lives for looking up the Tags by name as part of the 'create' action. But this is rather verbose and creates a tight coupling between DTO and service that should be avoided imho
* When _not_ using DTOs but the Entities directly, the many-to-many association can be annotated with `@JsonIdentityInfo` and a reference to an `ObjectIdResolver` implementation that does this lookup (i.e. by having the Tag repository injected). This works nicely...but does not work when you want to use DTO's. Also annotating Entities with Jackson annotations feels wrong.

What's your approach to these challenges? I was surprised to not find any concensus or best practice on something as common and elementary as this.

For bonus points, let's say you want to apply some business logic to the lookup as well. For example, if the given 'tag' does not exist yet, you want to create it. Will that change your approach?",18,java,2020-10-13

I really want to choose Java because of its type safety which I value a lot. But it seems I should probably choose Rails for its developer ecosystem with respect to creating web apps. 

It seems the mindset in SpringBoot is mostly to create the backend API then throw an overkill React/Angular app on top.

With a 100ms request at a 5000 rps rate, I was able to serve 99% of the requests with little or no response time increase while using virtual threads, whilst when using regular threads, only 30% of the requests were served with a 9x increase in response time

ii3y9u,What is wrong with this Java code? (Interview Question),"I've been asked this question on an interview and I'll also share what I answered.

I would like to know if there's anything I haven't thought of?

Java code:

```
if(person.getName() = “jan”) {return true;}
```

My answer was the following:

1. If `person` is `null`, you'll get an NPE

2. Using `=` is wrong, even `==` is wrong for strings, we don't look for the same reference but for the same value, equals would be adequate here like this: `""jan"".equals(person.getName())`

3. Something like `person.getName()` is rarely always lowercase, folks enter these sorts of things manually when they sign up. What if it's ""Jan"" instead or ""JAN""? Should we return true then?

4. What kind of user experience drives the design here? Why return true for a specific name?

So, if a software developer has JDK and JRE on their employer-provided workstation and is using it to develop and test applications, is it free?

If another employee in the same company has Java 8 JRE installed on their laptop because some work tools needed for their job duties or training require Java in the browser to load the web page, is that free?

ih5cl8,Why are checked exceptions frowned upon?,"AFAIK the following opinions are widespread in the programming community:

* Exceptions should be used for *exceptional* situations only, which generally means all that breaks the program's logic, but never as a control instruction. Sniff test: If your program can meaningfully handle the exception and then continue, you should not use an exception, since the situation is sensible in terms of your program logic. If a condition requires your program to crash (eg: out of memory error, bug detected at runtime such as assertion failure), then the situation is exceptional and it may be right to throw an exception.
* In cases that are not meaningless from the point of view of the logic of your program, when you might be tempted to use an exception (eg: file missing, invalid user input, etc), you should use some other language feature instead, one that provides type safety. Examples: Try pattern (cumbersome in Java due to the lack of `out` variables), `Optional`, some variation of `Either` (requires third party libraries in Java, or a poor man's solution in the form of a tuple).
* Checked exceptions in Java are a Bad Thing and Java programmers hate them.

I'm having trouble in understanding the underlying principles. (1) Exceptions are Evil because they throw away type safety (you have to remember yourself to catch all exceptions) (2) Checked exceptions are Evil.

But checked exceptions bring type safety to exceptions!

The advice to use some variation of the `Either` pattern instead of exceptions especially confuses me, since `Either` is, in fact, isomorphic to checked exceptions. 

Why are checked exceptions frowned upon and why are facilities like some variation of `Either` recommended instead?",71,java,2020-10-13

While solving two related problems we had at work, I've created two open-source libraries that solve those problems for us.

The problems are:

1. When appending additional context information to log messages (via MDC), how to ensure that the information stays relevant or is removed otherwise?
1. When logging is relevant for statistics, alerting etc., it should be tested. How can this be done easily in unit/integration tests?

So we've used these libraries intensively for over a year now and continue to maintain them. Since we made them open source, I'd be very happy to 

1. See some adoption in case I've created something actually useful :-)
1. Get some feedback on the usefulness and usability of those libs (or their documentation)

So here are the libs. They kind of go together, but can be used independently:

I'm new to the community and just finished up a few hours of learning Java tonight. So far I've logged 47.5 hours into learning Java in the last couple of weeks. I use an Excel document to track. Currently learning from a Udemy course and supplementing it with JetBrains Academy. 

After spending nearly 50 hours in learning Java, I find that I spend alot of time thinking about how someone else will read my code. Even when I do learn a more concise way of doing things, I'll usually sacrifice the few extra key strokes for the readability. Jet Brains Academy has been keeping me in check as far as whitespace goes. As a beginner and reading other people's code, I see alot of one line statements that are confusing to follow, even after looking things up in the Oracle documentation. Maybe once I spend more time with the language it'll be easier to follow and make more sense.

My question is, where is the line that you draw in conciseness vs readability. Is it all just preference? I've played guitar for over 10 years, and know the importance of establishing good habits from the start. What is best practice for someone learning? Should I always be striving to make my code as concise as possible?

ibj2ua,"JobRunr, Project Loom and Virtual Threads","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/81qrjhbqolh51.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c20a601e8e803662c7bbcb399f8ffbe43bee5f

JDK 16 early access has a build available including Project Loom which is all about virtual, light-weight threads (also called Fibers) that can be created in large quantities, without worrying about exhausting system resources.

Project Loom is also the reason why I did not use a reactive framework for JobRunr as it will change the way we will write concurrent programs. Project Loom with it's Virtual Threads is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for the existing threading framework and I tried it out using JobRunr today. This also means that JobRunr, as of v0.9.16 (to be released soon), will support project Loom out-of-the-box while still also supporting every JVM since Java 8!

Implementing support for Project Loom was easier than I thought using a `ServiceLoader`. I extracted a simple interface called `JobRunrExecutor` from the existing `ScheduledThreadPool`.

    public interface JobRunrExecutor extends Executor {
    
        int getPriority();
        
        void start();
        
        void stop();
    }

I then created another implementation of the interface using JDK 16 making use of Project Loom which does nothing more than delegating to a Virtual Thread:

    public class VirtualThreadJobRunrExecutor implements JobRunrExecutor {
    
        private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(VirtualThreadJobRunrExecutor.class);
        
        @Override
        public int getPriority() {
            return 5;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void start() {
            LOGGER.info(""JobRunrExecutor of type 'VirtualThreadJobRunrExecutor' started"");
        }
        
        @Override
        public void stop() {
            // nothing to do
        }
        
        @Override
        public void execute(Runnable runnable) {
            Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable);
        }
    
    }

Using a standard `ServiceLoader` I was able to inject the `VirtualThreadJobRunrExecutor` thus adding support for Virtual Threads!

    private JobRunrExecutor loadJobRunrExecutor() { 
        ServiceLoader&lt;JobRunrExecutor&gt; serviceLoader = ServiceLoader.load(JobRunrExecutor.class); 
        return stream(spliteratorUnknownSize(serviceLoader.iterator(), Spliterator.ORDERED), false)
           .sorted((a, b) -&gt; compare(b.getPriority(), a.getPriority()))
           .findFirst()
           .orElse(new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(serverStatus.getWorkerPoolSize(), ""backgroundjob-worker-pool"")); 
    } 

With all this in place, it was time to test and see if performance is better.

# Performance showdown: Java 11 vs Java 16 without Virtual Threads vs Java 16 with Virtual Threads

As I want to make sure performance is as good as it gets, I have some end-to-end tests which I run regularly, which can be found in the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/jobrunr/example-salary-slip](https://github.com/jobrunr/example-salary-slip). In that project, paychecks are generated for 2000 employees using a Word template and then transformed to PDF.

To compare Java 11, Java 16 and Java 16 with Virtual Threads, I ran this project again and hooked up JVisualVM. To give the JVM some time to warm up, I ran each test 3 times.

Comparing performances is not fair as JobRunr only checks for new jobs every 15 seconds and thus comparing these numbers just depends on the fact when I enqueued the jobs. Just to be complete, you can find the numbers below:

|Run|Java 11|Java 16|Java 16 with Loom|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|140|146|151|
|2|132|167|139|
|3|139|167|137|

All numbers are in seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

What we can compare is the results from JVisualVM. And boy, are these worthwhile!

## 

## The biggest difference is memory usage:

* JDK 11 occupied a heap of 6.8 GB with a peak use of 4.7 GB
* JDK 16 without Virtual Threads occupied a heap of 4.6 GB with a peak use of 3.7 GB
* JDK 16 with Virtual Threads occupied a heap of 2.7 GB with a peak use of 2.37 GB

So, using JDK 16 with these light-weight virtual threads resulted in:

* only 50% usage of heap memory compared to JDK 11
* only 64% usage of heap memory compared to JDK 16 without virtual threads

# Conclusion

While I initially thought that Project Loom would increase performance a lot, I currently see major improvements in memory usage. I was surprised as how easy it was to support Project Loom thanks to the use of the `ServiceLoader`. The source code for this article is off-course available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jobrunr/example-salary-slip/tree/loom).

Do note that JDK 16 is an early-access build and it's not even sure if Project Loom will be part of JDK 16.

This process does work, but is rather application-centric and doesn't address other issues that can come up in the configuration. I was considering other framework, but do need something that would work well with spring-based applications. When I receive an event I may need to look up other associated data via my spring data-based services, and cascade out through other parts of the ecosystem. 

I do use Hazelcast so was considering maybe Jet, but I'm not sure if this is a good fit for my model. I've also seen the Spring Cloud Data Flow project, but haven't tried anything hands on yet.

i9ua7i,Oracle Java in a Virtual Environment,"We've been working on removing/replacing Oracle Java in our company for a long time now and are at the point where we have applications that must use Oracle Java (older, public versions) and want to provide a way for our users to use it in an easy and secure manner.

Our security team recommended to put the various older versions (these are public releases) each on their own Virtual Machine and isolate/harden it on the network.

I was thrown into this recently and have been struggling to make sense of the licensing and if it even applies to the public versions we will be using. I've also heard that if you put Oracle Java in your virtual environment (say, a VMware host) then you would potentially need to license that entire host and all VMs on it. However I believe an Oracle Database was only mentioned, and we wouldn't be using this. The use case would only be for end users accessing a website or using an application that has Oracle Java built into it.

Is this true for putting a public version of Oracle Java in a virtual environment? Or can we safely put the various versions we need onto their own virtual machines and secure them?

I would appreciate any help as this is very new to me but I've been taking it on the chin and learning as much as I can. Thanks!",0,java,2020-10-13

----

It's clear from dozens of comment threads in several recent posts ([*here*](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/hyxnpu/finalizing_in_jdk_16_records/fzieom0/) and [*here*](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/i5c8wl/how_much_of_new_java_software_is_written_using/g0ohk61/) *for example*) that there is a lot of confusion, conflation and contradiction of what ""*LTS*"" really, truly means. I know it's confusing AF to me anyway.

For me at least, the key to clearing up the confusion, is to try to figure out:

1. How long is *Long-term* in ""*LTS*"" terms?
2. Who is Oracle pitching ""*LTS*"" to?
3. What does the ""*support*"" in ""*Long-Term Support*"" cover?
4. Is Adopt's, Amazon's, BellSoft's, etc. ""*LTS*"" the same as Oracle's ""*LTS*""?

----

\#***1***: The answer to my *Q1* is in two parts: 

* You can buy [***Premier Support***](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) from Oracle to get five years ""*LTS*"" (*until 2023 for JDK 11*)  
* And for ""***an additional fee***"" you can buy [***Extended Support***](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) and get three additional years (*until 2026 for JDK 11*)

I interpret Oracle's *Lifetime Support* docs to mean that the shortest duration of ""*LTS*"" is five years(*?*) But, confusingly, the answer to Oracle's [***Q7***](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/update-and-faq-on-the-java-se-release-cadence) bundles those two *distinct* support durations together with:

&gt;&gt; [*JDK*] *11 will have* ***commercial support*** *from Oracle available for at least eight additional years*

----

\#***2***: I emphasized ***commercial support*** just then because this other part of Oracle's ***Q7*** answer offers a clue for my *Q2*:

&gt;&gt; *so that we can focus on the needs of our customers*

I read those ***commercial support*** and ***our customers*** parts of their answer to mean that Oracle is pitching their ""*LTS*"" at their ***paying customers***.

So it seems clear enough, to me at least, that if you're not a ***paying*** customer of Oracle or some other vendor, then you are ***not*** getting five *Premier* years, nor „*eight additional years*“ of support for JDK 11.

----

\#***3***: The answer to my *Q3* is in the wording of Oracle's [***Q7***](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/update-and-faq-on-the-java-se-release-cadence)

&gt;&gt; *stability updates, performance updates and security updates*

Oracle's page on their [***Premier Support***](https://www.oracle.com/support/premier/software/) lists the things it bills as „*Comprehensive Software Support*“. 

If money's no object, [***Extended Support for Java SE***](https://www.oracle.com/us/assets/057419.pdf) buys you three additional years of „*Bug fixes, security fixes and minor updates*“, „*Upgrade tools*“ and „*Assistance with service requests 24 hours per day, 7 days a week*“ among other things.

----

\#***4***: I haven't looked into each OpenJDK vendor's definition of their ""*LTS*"" offering. But I did briefly look into [*Amazon's Corretto*](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/hyxnpu/finalizing_in_jdk_16_records/fzi5zmb/). From [*the reply I got*](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/hyxnpu/finalizing_in_jdk_16_records/fzi650k/) from the extraordinarily knowledgeable /r/Java poster /u/pron98, I for one, can't help but suspect that some OpenJDK vendors are either intentionally or unknowingly capitalizing on our confusion over what ""*LTS*"" actually means.

Once again, Oracle's ***Q7*** answer is crucial to understanding what Oracle means my ""*LTS*"":

&gt;&gt; *once Oracle* ***stops contributing our source code changes to a particular release series in OpenJDK***, *so that we can* ***focus on the needs of our customers***, *other qualified contributors in* ***the OpenJDK Community may step in to continue to maintain the release series*** [*emphasis mine*]

I read that to mean: *Oracle has already stopped contributing source code changes to the JDK 11 release in OpenJDK...except for when such source code changes meet the needs of Oracle's* ***paying*** *customers...Nevertheless, Red Hat, Amazon, Adopt, whoever, may step in to continue to maintain OpenJDK 11*. 

----

So yeah, it is true that you don't have to pay to download, use and deploy the actual ***binaries*** for releases that Oracle (*and by extension, vendors like Adopt et. al.*) designates as ""*LTS*"".

***But*** if you want „***commercial support***“ then that is what you ***do*** have to pay for. 

Even with all the reading up on it I just did, ""*LTS*"" is still not 100% crystal clear to me yet. None of what I've interpreted above is intended to pretend I'm an expert on the subject. I'm not. 

What *is* clear is that ""*LTS*"" probably doesn't mean what a ton of people seem to think it means.

My intention is to start a discussion on the subject, to engage the collective knowledge of the Java community to help make it clearer to all of us.

So, if I've misinterpreted anything above, I'm hoping that somebody will correct me where I'm wrong. TIA.

i5oab3,How do you people use such a piece of shit as Gradle?,"Decided to try it, as it seems to be a modern Java build tool. Ok let's start (with kotlin &amp; gradle).

1) `brew install gradle` - it installs `openjdk` as a dependency, even though I already had HotSpot JDK installed, but ok, whatever.

2) `gradle init` - and my project is polluted with garbage - gradle.build (ok that one is expected) and also - gradlew, gradlew.bat, gradle/wrapper, config.something.gradle, properties.gradle, .gitattributes. WTF is that? Tiny build utility the whole point of which is to sit somewhere in background and don't interrupt me - that utility with the very first step - init - put tons of garbage in my project, and not in some dark corner of the project in hidden directory, but at the very top?!

3) Ok, I manually removed all that garbage, leaving only `gradle.build`, trying `gradle run` from the console - all good.

4) Time to connect with Intelij IDEA, creating/importing project. IDEA slowly thinking for a minute, then - regenerates all that gradle garbage again. All the gradle files I manually deleted - are now again in the project. IDEA re-generates that gradle garbage every time I manually delete it.

5) Ok after asking - some people told me that I need to change setting in IDEA so it will take gradle from predefined location. I changed - and it worked, for couple of minutes, until I updated gradle.build - and suddenly it became red in IDEA, all sorts of errors (still works fine from console).",0,java,2020-10-13

ja3r39,Is it true that inheritance isn't used that much in regular Java development?,"Hi all

So I am currently in training for a junior developer position. We are going over inheritance right now, and the course material says ""you'll find that inheritance is not as common as you think in Java web development"", which surprised me. The course material went on to say that interfaces are much more commonly used and preferred than inheritance.

Have you found this to be the case in your line of work? Thanks!",116,java,2020-10-13
j9mv3x,.toUUID(): A tiny library for generating human-readable UUIDs for automated tests,"We often use UUIDs where I work, which is fine, but UUIDs is a pain to deal with when you have to create them in tests:

* Creating UUIDs look ugly
* Creating UUIDs takes up a lot of space
* Creating UUIDs decrease the readability.

This might all be minor gripes I have, but I like my tests to be short and clean.

The most common way to generate a human-readable UUID is doing the following:

`UUID.fromString(""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"");`

If you use .toUUID() you can get the same result like this:

`toUUID(1);`

There's also a few more bells and whistles like generating UUIDs based on a collection, varargs or a range of integers.

If you find yourself having to deal with UUIDs in automated tests, or you want to generate a set of simple UUIDs quickly, then .toUUID() might be up your alley: [https://github.com/atomfinger/toUUID](https://github.com/atomfinger/toUUID)

.toUUID() were initially made by me, for me, but if UUIDs annoy me, then it might annoy others as well.

*Edit: thanks for the feedback. Especially thanks to the concrete feedback which pointed out flaws.*

*While this post has garnered a net-positive response in terms of up votes it has not been blessed with the same  positivity in the comments. The core issue, as I interpret it, is that people don't see the benefit of using this library compared to the current flow they are using, which clearly indicates that I haven't done a good enough job explaining this. I thought I had done a decent job (or made the false assumption that it was self evident), but it is obvious that I need to do better in this regard :) Again though, thanks for the feedback, it is appreciated.*",61,java,2020-10-13

j6bwoq,[Rant] Has this ever happened to you?,"Here's a screenshot of the commit I just made to fix a bug that I hunted literally four hours.

https://preview.redd.it/z9ndje1u0jr51.png?width=2259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e39af40d49cb1a25823eba35c05b6658e6ff374d

As you can see, the fix was five lines, practically just copy-paste the method below. [Commit is here.](https://github.com/kleinesfilmroellchen/sof-language/commit/77c9c9d9c7958fec99fb148617305e5e6593ea25)

The rant in text form:

&gt;Last commit switched over the Nametable backing map implementation from TreeMap to HashMap. TreeMap is always aware of the key and value types (in this case, Identifier and Stackable respectively). Therefore, when it needs to compare keys when retrieving/inserting/moving values, it calls key1.equals(key2). Because both key1 and key2 are typed as Identifier (generic type K in the actual source), Java picks a correct equals() override to invoke. In my case, all Stackable subtypes have an equals(Stackable) implemented (because Stackable is an interface and cannot override the Object inherited method equals(Object) ). And because Identifier is an implementor of Stackable, in the TreeMap equality check, Java will find that equals(Stackable) method and call it. Which is correct because it checks for the desired identifier name equality.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, for whatever reason, HashMap does at some point in its internal method chain forget the types of the objects. Despite it being a generic interface with type information always readily available. This means that by the time it does its equality checks (which, of course, are still required for many operations), it will consider key1 and key2 to be Objects. And call Object.equals(Object). Which I, unfortunately, hadn't implemented in Identifier. So the default check is basically pointer equality, which of course fails, and no key-value mapping is ever found again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks, Java.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I know to always implement Object.equals(Object) as well, just as this commit does for Identifier, which fixes everything. Sorry for breaking your stuff with the last commit. I really didn't see this one coming.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

(To be fully correct, TreeMap mostly uses the Comparator's compare() method, which is implemented by Identifier. But the point still stands.)

This method essentially maps the object and then calls the referenced method on it without mapping the whole stream down (to String in this case).

j28d43,[Hacktoberfest] We need Java developers for the MyLibreLab Free and Open Source software,"Hey folks, 

The month of October is ahead of us and there is a lot of excitement in the air among software developers. Everyone is rushing to get their hands on some nice FLOSS and get publicity, experience, and just pure joy of contribution! We have also a nice project that needs help.

MyLibreLab is a fork of the MyOpenLab software. It provides a visual programming environment, predominantly used to control microcontroller hardware such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.  It's an open-source alternative to LabVIEW. Check the [yet to be finished documentation](https://mylibrelab.github.io/user-documentation/).

We forked the MyOpenLab software quite a while ago because:

- The community has become a German and Spanish only one leaving the rest of the world out. Sadly the code base is also mostly documented in those languages.
- The core developer was hired by, guess who? National Instrument, the owner of the LabVIEW. Sadly the codebase was severely neglected after that.

We decided to give it a new life! We migrated from Sourceforge to GitHub, switched to Gradle, improved the project structure, and some cleanup, but the project still needs more love for our first release.

So, as title says, I'm senior java dev and I don't know theory. I don't know how, but I've been in 3 companies already, and successfully passed interviews in them. But before going to these companies, I also was trying to pass interviews in other companies and failing them. Every time after I've failed an interview, I've studied those topics at which I failed.

The problem is, I can't remember theory for a long time, and I keep forgetting it, especially if I don't use it. You can ask me a simple junior level question, and I'll sound like a trainee level developer.

I'm confident in my practical and analytical skills, my teammates and managers never had a problem with me and feedbacks are always on a level of ""meets/exceeds expectations"", and companies themselves are known companies, so it's not like ""Yeah, whatever. Let's take this random guy and give him good title""

izzjny,Suggestions for charting with Java,"I've been given the responsibility of reworking the plotting functionality of the software at my job. The software currently implements a two year old version of XChart with in house zooming functionality written to compensate for XChart's lacking at the time. Beyond zooming our GUI is essentially unusable because of the lag caused by XChart/In house zooming.

The current version of XChart has zoom functionality built in but it would still need to be overridden to fit our needs (it zooms with x-axis coordinates only.) Or I can try to refactor our zoom customization to run more efficiently.

The bit of research I've done seems like JFreeChart is a front runner but it's lack of support over the last few years makes me weary. I've also come across ChartFX and JavaFX chart that seem promising.

Any advice/help going forward is much appreciated. Thank you!",10,java,2020-10-13

java.io.IOException: Could not determine a temporary executable directory.

&amp;#x200B;

What is frustrating, is we never get this error on the development side. QA cannot reproduce it. Only SOME of our clients have this issue.

After a lot of analysis, I believe it is because their anti-virus 'Trend Micro' is blocking the library from accessing the %appdata%/temp directory.

I have two questions:

1. Has someone had a similar experience, and if so was there a code change possible to prevent this?
2. Is there an alternative library to use for Java Swing desktop application which has similar functionality to CEF?

Of course, there will be classics as ""Effective Java"" by Joshua Bloch or ""Clean code"" by Robert C. Martin but maybe there are books that are less popular but very valuable?

Please give me your proposition.

I’ve spent last half year working on a lightweight library for configuring a http client to communicate over tls/ssl. I have tested it with over [30+ http clients](https://github.com/Hakky54/sslcontext-kickstart#tested-http-clients) for java, scala and kotlin. The core library contains only one transitive dependency, slf4j-api, and the remaining part only uses the available classes within the jdk.

In the past I was required to configure a http client with different configurations depending on the project requirements, such as:

* One way authentication
* Two way authentication
* Using multiple truststores and keystores
* Using pem files

To make it easy to reuse for myself and everyone I thought it would be good to make a library out of it and also contribute back to the community. Hope you guys like it. Feel free to send my some critiques!

Lately, my company paid for a course about JavaEE 7 development.

Sadly, the course was only 40h long, and It barely scrached the surface of all the APIs it has to offer.

Anyway, there might be a chance for me, to get a voucher for the 1z0-900 certification exams.

I was pretty thrilled about It, and i'm not scared about the amount of stuff to study, but I'm a bit worried, since looks like there aren't many people talking about It. For example, I browsed reddit, and the only posts found about ""1z0-900"" were spam.

So, my questions are:


- Is this certification relevant? Or should I spend my time on something else?


- Why so few people talk about this cert?


- Can you suggest any kind of material Where to study for It?
(At the moment i'm blindly following the official Java EE7 tutorial, but I'm a practical learner, and I'd like some stuff with more examples Where to put my hands on)


- I've heard someone suggesting to read specific books about single APIs. In this case, i Guess there would be some APIs more important than others. which specification would you study deeper, and which one would you just skim through?

However, all this time I've been doing mostly Go development and had a major paradigm shift, limiting my dependencies and only choosing small libraries for certain tasks became intuitive for me.

After researching the state of current Java back-end development, I felt quite intimidated by the sheer amount of frameworks and dependencies that are being used even in small projects. I played around with Spring Initializr and the amount of ""unknown"" that I can pull is flustering.

I also should clarify that I'm not looking down on frameworks, I understand the benefits for people who regularly solve similar problems, especially in large teams.

If you've been following JavaFX, then you are aware that Gluon have made significant progress in cross-platform development, particularly for mobile.

Building on this success, the 11.11 release of the FXGL game engine brings seamless mobile support with little to no code change from the developer.

A full demo is available from the [original tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1304731964323307520)

The Breakout source (incl. sources of other popular titles) is available from [FXGLGames](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames#build-for-mobile) The repository also contains instructions on how to build to Android (if you are on Linux) or to iOS (if you are on Mac OS).

Given this is the first stable mobile-compatible release, the community feedback on the build process (and potential issues) is very valuable and much appreciated. These issues can be reported at [FXGL GitHub repo](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) where you can also, should you wish to, support the project development.

ir6ha3,Did I Make a Mistake? Introductory Coding in University Depressing Me...,"Hi guys,

Not asking for any specific programming help, just wanting some general advice and hoping to get a feel for whether or not I'm on the right path.

I'm a physics, economics and political science student at a university. I've had some trouble figuring out exactly what I want to do, because I'm interested in so much, hence the mixture.  This semester, I wanted to keep the possibility of switching one those majors to data science.

My university offers a data science degree, so I started taking one of its core courses, an introductory course for **Java**. The course not only opens the door to the data science degree, but can also lead into a few other really interesting majors I'd potentially consider.

At the moment, I'm trying to keep doors open instead of closing them. I'm going through this phase where I'm afraid to tie myself to one thing, because I've got so many interests, and because I'm afraid of making a wrong choice. I'm afraid of both being intellectually starved at my future job, and being without money in an increasingly rationalized economy. For a long time, I've dreamed of combining economics and physics, but watching millions lose their jobs has gotten fearful thoughts about the job market whirling up in my head, and I think that's also why my mind has been wandering off more and more to data science. It seems to lead to more safer, non-academic jobs; but I also understand that could be a misguided perception of things. After all, I'm still a student and I'm not out in the big wide world yet.

This introductory Java course is my first serious coding experience, meaning that, for the first time, I've had to code under a kind of pressure similar to that under which I've been doing physics, economics and political science.

And at the moment, I'm feeling really dumb and really exhausted.

This introductory Java course has been wearing me out much more than I expected, much more than my theoretical physics and quantitative economics courses. I'm trying to understand how much of this is fairly normal, how much of it could be because I'm possibly not cut out for coding, and how much of it is potentially due to the course itself.

The last three years, I've held a 4.0 GPA, but I'm thinking this course will probably end that streak. I don't mean to be obsessive about the GPA, I just didn't think that the course to end that streak would've been an introductory coding course. Hence my feeling really dumb.

The last few weeks, I've had to invest hours and hours into what I think should be fairly simple coding assignments. We're forced to use an auto-grader that is very strict and often very buggy. Most of the hours go into just trying to get the auto-grader to except the subission. The course book isn't really working for me either.

I've now considered withdrawing from the course without a grade. I'd have a withdrawal on my transcript, but I'm worried the time I'm losing for other courses isn't worth it. However, if I do withdraw, the doors to other potential majors with that course as a pre-requisite close for me.

I think it would help me get a perspective for things if I knew whether or not my difficulties are normal, and if so, how to best proceed. Does this experience sound similar to anyone else's? Anyone here have a rough start in coding? I'm still fairly new to it and don't yet feel like I know how to best approach it. How did you turn things around if you were initially having a tought time? What would you say are the clearest signs that I need to re-think my path and possibly withdraw?

Thanks for listening and stay well!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I'm touched so many people took the time to respond. Your responses have really helped me, everyone. Thank you so much. Looking at the majority of the comments, it seems like coding is just hard for most beginners. Your words are encouraging as it looks like the learning curve is simply steep, and even if that means stress and temporary anguish, I can deal with that. I've done it before. I used to be AWFUL at mathematics, C-ing and D-ing my way through school, until I was able to find out how I could best teach myself. I ended up being valedictorian (I couldn't believe it) and now I'm studying a subject I never thought I'd be able to even touch with a ten-foot pole and doing pretty well. 

I'm someone who avoids outward directed arrogance like the plague, but I admit I've had arrogant thoughts. And I think that's what happened here: I got cocky from previous success and thus, I approached programming from an arrogant mindset, as in ""How hard can it be? It's more practical, you push buttons, use pre-determined commands and you don't have to derive complex laws!"" 

I'm getting the kick in the ass I needed. Better now than later! In these last few days, I have gained a lot of respect for programmers and coders, much more than I ever had before. It's not only logically challenging, there is also a lot of creativity required. So many angles from which one can approach one problem! 

Anyway, thank you all very much for your time. I will keep grinding away at it!",45,java,2020-10-13
ir5ozw,Syncing Eclipse Across Multiple Computers,"Hello guys,

I am relatively new to programming. I am taking a java class for college this semester. I heard that you can sync Eclipse across multiple computers using Google Drive or other cloud storage services. I would like to try this with Drive but I can't find any good tutorials on here nor online. Any help? I appreciate any feedback.

Thanks.

EDIT: My friend was able to help me sync it using OneDrive. It was way easier than what I thought. All I had to do was download OneDrive on my desktop, move my workplace folder onto OneDrive, then switch the workplace to said workplace. I would recommend having the same versions of Eclipse and the JDK if you can. It will save you a lot of the trouble that I went through.",1,java,2020-10-13

iqw1ea,"How to add authorization (permissions, roles, etc.) in Java Apps","Hi all!

We've built an open source library for adding authorization (permissions, roles, etc.) to Java apps, called oso. You write policies using the oso policy language to govern who can do what inside your application, then you integrate them with a few lines of code using our library. Under the hood, it's a policy engine that's embedded in your application.

Roles are a common pattern to reach for when setting up permissions, but we've found that they're limited and can get clunky, so oso provides a language (called *Polar*) that's purpose-built for representing common domain concepts that can be useful like data ownership, hierarchies, relationships, etc.

You can use oso in any Java application, and we made a tutorial for using it in Spring Boot ([https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html](https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html)). You can follow along by cloning the example repository and trying it out: [https://github.com/osohq/oso-spring-tutorial](https://github.com/osohq/oso-spring-tutorial)

Edit: Please don't downvote without giving a reason.

Trying to start a discussion here.

Personally, I'm a (serious) C# developer and whenever I tell that to a Java dev I get an immediate negative reaction. I think this is based on C#'s history as a closed Window's only language. But a lot has changed since then. It's now cross-platform, and almost entirely open-source. There is a well designed set of tools for literally everything in .NET which makes it hard to convince me to give Java another try.

JPA, meanwhile, is the devil. I love how easy it is to maintain, but I'm constantly dealing with weird and inexplicable bugs, like the current one I'm struggling with where JPA is trying to delete a DB record on an update instead of updating it, thus causing constraint violations. I really hate all the weird shit that goes on behind the scenes with JPA. I also love SQL in terms of creating and managing my schema, I never use JPA to auto-generate it.

So I have been reading about JOOQ. It seems to have a lot going for it. It's a SQL DSL rather than an ORM, and the DSL appears to just make it easier to write type safe queries and (I hope) convert to Java classes from the tables. I'm just wondering how people feel about it. Is it less wonky than JPA or just have its own quirks? Are there any other tools for working with SQL and Java that I should consider?

PS. My job has been considering JPA alternatives for a while, but hasn't looked into it. Being able to work with a SQL schema file is essential because of multiple environment deployment.",45,java,2020-10-13

inol55,Does anyone else not like the non-sealed keyword?,"In the current version of sealed classes in Java 15, whenever you have a sealed class or interface, you declare which classes are permitted to extend or implement it.

```
public sealed interface Computer permits Laptop, Desktop, CellPhone {}
```

And then the classes which extend that sealed class must either declare that they are `final`, with no more extension allowed.

```
public final class Laptop implements Computer {}
```

That they are `sealed` again, meaning this subclass also has a restricted set of subclasses.

```
public sealed class Desktop implements Computer permits BudgetPC, GamingPC {}
```

Or that they are `non-sealed`, which means that they can be subclassed arbitrarily.

```
public non-sealed class CellPhone implements Computer {}
```

My issue is that in normal situations with java, `final` means ""No extension"" and no modifier already means ""arbitrary extension allowed"".

```
public class CellPhone implements Computer {}
```

So it would be unambiguous to just have no modifier at all.

While I understand that other JVM languages have trended towards final classes by default and requiring some sort of keyword like `open` to say that they are open for extension, the rest of Java does not have this behavior which makes this really stand out.

I know the language designers must have taken this into account and probably erred on the side of making people explicitly choose the behavior they want, but as much of a bikeshed as it is I really wish the language maintained symmetry.

I guess it is comforting that unlike most things in Java one could dislike there is time for this to change if other people feel the way I do and express that to the language team, but I kinda want to get a read on how other people feel.",28,java,2020-10-13

## Some history

In February 2020, right before the whole COVID-19 mess started, I decided it was time to try something new in my career - developing my own product. Since 2009, I always worked as a freelance consultant on different software projects but never developed a real product for end customers. Most of my projects where business applications making life easier for employees of different companies.

When I initially started my career (somewhere in 2004), I found that open-source world was mostly only happening in Java - the complete .NET world was still in it's infancy and there did not exist a lot of open-source projects for C#. And due to my job choices at that moment, I continued developing in the Java and Android world.

Fast forward to 2015 where I worked as a freelance consultant and did some pre-sales for a customer of a company where I consulted that really wanted to have it's software developed in C#. Since I provided the estimates for this project, I also wanted to work on it as I did not want to be the guy who just gave some (way to optimistic) estimates and then moved along. No, I wanted to see whether the numbers I gave also worked out.

As I only developed in Java like languages until 2015 and the customer insisted on Microsoft products, it was time to learn some C# and the whole eco-system of the .NET world. And wauw, did that change since 2004. They did not only have a lot more IoC frameworks - 11 in .NET vs 3 or 4 in Java (the famous ones are Spring and Guice), there were some frameworks like [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) and [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/) with which I really fell in love and that did not exist in the Java world. As soon as I understood the advantage of these frameworks, I always told my colleague's that I would port them to Java someday.

## Fast-forward to 2019/2020

I was consulting on a Java project where the developers again made their own Java version of Hangfire (but without retries and monitoring) and I thought about the promise I made to port Hangfire to Java. Initially, I didn't think it was possible as a lambda in .NET can be easily analysed as an Expression which is not possible in Java. But, thanks to some digging and learning the inner-bits of the JVM bytecode, I found [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) which allowed me to analyse a Java 8 lambda and find all the necessary information to create the Java version of Hangfire. I then contacted [Sergei Odinokov](https://twitter.com/odinserj), the creator of Hangfire to ask him if it was ok to do so and luckily enough I quickly got his blessing and some excellent tips too.   
So, in February 2020 I started on my adventure to create the Java port of Hangfire and developed it using all the best practices I learned over the years (with some breaks due to working from home and having kids off-course). I often thought that I made a big mistake to give up my work as a freelance developer - I was sure that with the current Corona recession, I would have a lot of trouble to find a new job. We have some savings but this is not something I can do for years. Nevertheless, there was no immediate way back so the only way is forward.

## First release in April 2020

On April 8th, I released the first beta on JCenter for other people to test - ***Hello JobRunr!*** And, after some posts on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/java-batch-processing-made-easy-ronald-dehuysser/) about the first release, I started to receive feedback and some small bugs which I was able to fix quickly. Soon, some new [feature requests](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/22) came in and since I really liked the business model that Sergei used for Hangfire I thought about doing the same. But, the Java world is a totally different beast than the .NET world - the Java open-source eco-system is so large with all kind of great products that developers aren't used to pay for a library, ***me myself included***. But, no risk - no fun, let's just try it and see what happens!

## May 2020

## creating a community

Since users have questions that are not always bugs or feature requests, I looked into tools for this purpose. As [Gitter](https://gitter.im/jobrunr/community) is available by default for each GitHub repository, I ended up choosing it and reached out to some people that had questions. While some contact worked out nicely (I supported a really large number of users through it - *4 in total* 🙂), I still have my doubts about Gitter - I think the barrier is quite big and my guess is that Discourse would be a better option.

On the website, I also explicitly mention [StackOverflow with a custom tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=java%20jobrunr) but up to today, all questions came in via GitHub issues. I get actively notified about questions on JobRunr on StackOverflow but for some unknown reason, it is not working today.

## the Google Ads attempt

Since I'd loved to get the word out about JobRunr, I used some free Google Ads credit and monitored the visitors on the website. The number of visitors increased significantly but for some reason, the ads where mostly only shown to Indian visitors and it did not have a big effect on the amount of JobRunr users. Even after changing the regional settings for my ads, nothing really happened and I did not notice an increase in the amount of users for JobRunr (there were no extra questions in Gitter nor any new bugs or feature requests on GitHub). Since I did not want to spend any money on Google Ads, I stopped the Google Ads campaign.

## the first release on Maven Central and a post on Reddit

Since I received positive feedback from some users using it, I decided it was time to release it on Maven Central and as I heard that other dev's had good experience with blogging on Reddit, I wrote a [post about JobRunr in the Java community](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/gs4l50/jobrunr_available_in_maven_central/) \- and wauw, I received some wonderful feedback, traffic to the website peaked (see the peak in the google analytics image right before June) and the [GitHub stars](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/stargazers) jumped from 20 something to over 50. When publishing a Jar on Maven Central, you can also see some basic statistics and I quickly saw that I reached about 19 users (19 unique ip's) with JobRunr.

## June, July and August 2020

I continued improving JobRunr and added support for all kinds of SQL and NoSQL databases. I blogged about how to use it with [Kubernetes](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/blog/2020-05-06-jobrunr-kubrnetes-terraform/) and how I took [testing seriously](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/blog/2020-06-01-testing-against-12-jvms/). I tried to get the word out using [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/h8ymvd/jobrunr_v098_available_in_maven_central/), LinkedIn and Twitter and saw a small but steady increase of happy users. I also continued to work on the Pro version of JobRunr adding extra features which I loved myself in the past and which were requested by end-users. The number of visitors always increased when I blogged about JobRunr on either [DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/jobrunr-project-loom-and-virtual-threads) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@ronald.dehuysser/a-hands-on-tutorial-on-how-to-test-against-12-different-jvms-using-testcontainers-by-google-bcb2ceaeaa69) but on a typical day, I have about 5 to 15 unique visitors. The number of unique downloads of JobRunr also continues to rise according to the Maven Central statistics.

## Where are we in September 2020

Currently, I feel quite confident that there are no major bugs present anymore in JobRunr. I did thorough testing (unit, integration and end-to-end with Cypress.io and I also test JobRunr against 12 different JVM's.) I still want to add support for [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/), which allows me to support the top 9 most used databases with JobRunr, including Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, MySql, MariaDB and also NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Redis.

So, September will see the release of JobRunr v1.0 and I just updated the site with information about the [Pro version](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/).

## Some lingering questions

Currently, there are quite some questions lingering in my mind:

* ***do I imagine that the market for JobRunr is bigger than it really is?***   
I think that any larger java application could benefit from using JobRunr - the moment there is some heavy processing (like generating a document, firing of a web-hook which might fail, ...), I really think there is an added advantage for JobRunr. It is that reason why I was so happy with Hangfire. There are already a lot of distributed real-time streaming products like [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) but in my eyes, JobRunr tries to solve a different problem and I still see a market share for it.
* ***are there perhaps already too many alternatives present?***   
I came quite late to the distributed background job processing party - there is already [Quartz](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/), [Spring @scheduled](https://spring.io/guides/gs/scheduling-tasks/), [Spring Batch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch) and [db-scheduler](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler). Yet, I think JobRunr still adds a lot of value as, in my eyes, it so easy to use, to setup and the dashboard gives easy insights for both developers and perhaps even business users. But, developers go with the libraries they know and since each of these libraries already have a well-established community so it will be difficult to convince them to use JobRunr.
* ***is JobRunr known by enough developers?***   
this is something I struggle with: I write blog posts about JobRunr for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/rdehuyss/posts/), [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/912925/rdehuyss.html), [Medium](https://medium.com/@ronald.dehuysser) and [Jaxenter](https://jaxenter.com/jobrunr-jvm-172830.html) \- all my preferred resources to stay up-to-date on the latest in tech. Still, I think I only reached about a couple of 1000 developers (if it is even that many) while there are [9,007,346 java developers](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+java+developers) and for the moment, I don't have a clue on how to reach these other developers.
* ***do developers and companies want to pay for freemium software?***   
this might also be a problem - we all got used to excellent software libraries without paying for it - it's part of the open-source movement which I off-course like. I could also perhaps setup some consulting around JobRunr but I don't think that will make me a living either.
* ***does the Pro version add enough value for the money? Is the annual licensing a good choice?***  
this is something I do not know for the moment and since I did not get any feedback on licensing yet (neither positive nor negative) it is something that only time will tell. I do think that the different features of JobRunr Pro like [Queues](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/queues/), [Batches](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/batches/) and [Job Chaining](https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/job-chaining/) add a lot of value. And, if I compare it to the time spent developing these features combined with my rate as a freelance developer, I think the price is more than reasonable.

## Preliminary conclusion

My gut feeling says it will be difficult to make a living out of JobRunr. To be completely open, I off-course did not sell any license up until now. I do know there is interest of one company for the Pro version but the management still needs to be convinced.

What it did do however is perhaps worth more - I learned a lot of new and cool stuff:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) which is used by the frontend,
* [Drone.io](https://drone.io/) which is a Docker based CI/CD platform I use for JobRunr
* [Hugo CMS](https://gohugo.io) which is used for the website

And, on top of that, several people contacted me with job opportunities (some of which really interesting) and it's good to know that I can fall back on something in these economical difficult times.

ilt5mm,"Spring, Hibernate &amp; DTO's: When to map associations?","Imagine a straight forward Spring Boot application with an API for 'Products'. Each Product can have multiple 'Tags', mapped by a many-to-many relation in Hibernate on the entities.

A Product has an ID, name and some other fields. A Tag also has an ID and name. The join table between them has both IDs.

Imagine a `POST /products` call as follows, which will be handled by a straight forward controller-service-repository chain:

```
{
  ""name"": ""keyboard"",
  ""tags"": [""electronics"", ""computer""]
}
```

Because we're good people, we'd like to use DTOs on the Controller side and not expose the DB entities directly.

Now, *somewhere* we need to lookup the Tags from the DB for the given String inputs. However, here I get stuck on what the best practice is to achieve this:

* Preferably the DTOs stay with the _controllers_ and don't 'leak' into the _services_. The conversion is done in the controller. This means that any converter we employ would need to do this String-to-DB-entity lookup which seems wrong to do on the _controller_ level.
* Alternatively, the DTO could be passed into the _service_ where the converter business logic lives for looking up the Tags by name as part of the 'create' action. But this is rather verbose and creates a tight coupling between DTO and service that should be avoided imho
* When _not_ using DTOs but the Entities directly, the many-to-many association can be annotated with `@JsonIdentityInfo` and a reference to an `ObjectIdResolver` implementation that does this lookup (i.e. by having the Tag repository injected). This works nicely...but does not work when you want to use DTO's. Also annotating Entities with Jackson annotations feels wrong.

What's your approach to these challenges? I was surprised to not find any concensus or best practice on something as common and elementary as this.

For bonus points, let's say you want to apply some business logic to the lookup as well. For example, if the given 'tag' does not exist yet, you want to create it. Will that change your approach?",14,java,2020-10-13

I use verilog at the moment, but I am interested in any experiences using java. I looked at JOP to execute JVM code directly on the FPGA, but I guess that makes only sense, if you write the performance-critical methods in some form of HDL, because I don't see much performance gain otherwise?

iknhl1,Fullstack SpringBoot vs Rails?,"I've been looking to create a fullstack SSR web app and came to the conclusion that I wanted to pick SpringBoot or Rails.

However SpringBoot is lacking in some areas for full stack development.

* Thymeleaf seems to be no longer maintained. Anyone have experience with other libs?
* No solution for the new idea of websocket rendering logic, see [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)/[StimulusReflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/)
* Have to give ergonomics of the tooling to Rails, was really surprised to see that there is no 'rails routes', 'rails generate model', 'rails db:migrate' etc

I really want to choose Java because of its type safety which I value a lot. But it seems I should probably choose Rails for its developer ecosystem with respect to creating web apps. 

It seems the mindset in SpringBoot is mostly to create the backend API then throw an overkill React/Angular app on top.

Anyone got experience with both Ruby/Java and Rails + SpringBoot? What do you think of them? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How do you do your standard CRUD fullstack web apps?",52,java,2020-10-13

There are a few things out there for Java, but I wanted a solution that did not require me to compile nor to use any kind of cache or language server. So I’ve spent the last 6 months devising my own solution.

It’s still in development, some parts only support maven and Java8, but I plan to remove these limitations eventually. Still, I’ve been using it daily for more than a month now, and it usually works fine, so I figured it’s time for a first release.

I’ve set it to run every time I save a file, and it has made my life much easier. Hopefully someone else can find use in it! It’s full of rough edges, so any bug report, request or simple feedback would be appreciated.

In terms of developer productivity, Quarkus is an absolute Joy. With default hot reloading and quick server startup times, it was fun writing decent code. Also given it uses Java EE (Ok JarakartaEE) standards and annotations, it makes it a bit easier for learning curve.

Tried to build something to make sure that the benefits are real even for non-toy applications with JPA and other factors involved; built a Blogging application (management and Front end) using Quarkus ecosystem.

Overall, easy, fun to write and really fast, would love to use in Production soon.

I would like to know if there's anything I haven't thought of?

Java code:

```
if(person.getName() = “jan”) {return true;}
```

My answer was the following:

1. If `person` is `null`, you'll get an NPE

2. Using `=` is wrong, even `==` is wrong for strings, we don't look for the same reference but for the same value, equals would be adequate here like this: `""jan"".equals(person.getName())`

3. Something like `person.getName()` is rarely always lowercase, folks enter these sorts of things manually when they sign up. What if it's ""Jan"" instead or ""JAN""? Should we return true then?

4. What kind of user experience drives the design here? Why return true for a specific name?

ih5cl8,Why are checked exceptions frowned upon?,"AFAIK the following opinions are widespread in the programming community:

* Exceptions should be used for *exceptional* situations only, which generally means all that breaks the program's logic, but never as a control instruction. Sniff test: If your program can meaningfully handle the exception and then continue, you should not use an exception, since the situation is sensible in terms of your program logic. If a condition requires your program to crash (eg: out of memory error, bug detected at runtime such as assertion failure), then the situation is exceptional and it may be right to throw an exception.
* In cases that are not meaningless from the point of view of the logic of your program, when you might be tempted to use an exception (eg: file missing, invalid user input, etc), you should use some other language feature instead, one that provides type safety. Examples: Try pattern (cumbersome in Java due to the lack of `out` variables), `Optional`, some variation of `Either` (requires third party libraries in Java, or a poor man's solution in the form of a tuple).
* Checked exceptions in Java are a Bad Thing and Java programmers hate them.

I'm having trouble in understanding the underlying principles. (1) Exceptions are Evil because they throw away type safety (you have to remember yourself to catch all exceptions) (2) Checked exceptions are Evil.

But checked exceptions bring type safety to exceptions!

The advice to use some variation of the `Either` pattern instead of exceptions especially confuses me, since `Either` is, in fact, isomorphic to checked exceptions. 

Why are checked exceptions frowned upon and why are facilities like some variation of `Either` recommended instead?",76,java,2020-10-13
