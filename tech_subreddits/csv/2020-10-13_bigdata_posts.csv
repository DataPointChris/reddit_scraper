So I have recently found out that my contract is moving offshore and thus I'll be put on bench in my current contracting company. I have a few months before this will happen so I want to pack in as much knowledge as I can between now and then. When I'm on bench I'll have full access to some good training materials. So I'd really like to take advantage of all this. 

I have roughly 2.5 to 3 years experience and have a primary foundation on apache hadoop. I work mainly with Hive and unix as of right now.  I'm also familiar with splunk and yarn. The basic stuff. We have our own ETL tool which builds most things via GUI. my SQL is still very good besides that point though as my work involves manually testing what we build. 

What would be the best tools or skills to have? As of right now I'm spending a lot of time with bettering my foundational knowledge of the hadoop framework.I am also spending dedicated time to further my Unix scripting. Specifically with awk, sed, and regular expressions. But I would like to learn new tools and concepts to help further my career.

Any and all help or advice is GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks!",2,bigdata,2020-10-13

We have been using Cloudera Express for our cluster, and now that it no longer exists, along with other free alternatives like HDP, we are at a decision point.

\- Our cluster has to be in-house. Cloud isn't an option.

\- Management does not want to get 'stuck' in the latest free version in case there are potential critical vulnerability / bug fixes or improvements for individual Hadoop stack components.

\- Paid subscription does not seem to be an option for us in the near future. (I understand Cloudera's decision and want to thank them for all the services they provided free of charge so far)

After a bit of search, it looks like we will have to install/manage a cluster manually, without a management/installation solution like Cloudera's. Which we don't have much of an experience with, so I have a few questions:

\- How hard would this be for a smallish cluster of 20 to 40 nodes. (Human resources required to build and maintain such a cluster) Note that we only use a small subset of components: Hadoop, HBase, Spark, Kafka.

\- For those of you who have hand-rolled clusters: can I simply pull &amp; build a version of Hadoop, and other Hadoop components that are declared to be compatible with that version of Hadoop and expect all to work without major problems? Or are there intricacies and painful integration work that we may be underestimating?

\- Should I try using Ambari and build stacks for it instead of rolling it manually? Anyone have any experience or estimates on the difficulty of this path? I do understand that without Cloudera/HDP, who are one of the top contributors (or the top?), all these projects including Ambari will likely stagnate and this whole thing would be moot anyway, but I am not given many options.

\- Any other alternatives that I may have missed?

j8j0zb,Big Data Vs Data Science- What Is The Difference?," 

Data is everywhere. The amount of digital data that exists is rapidly increasing, doubling every two years, and changing the manner in which we live. Information is all over the place. Till the year 2020,about1,7 megabytes of new information will be generated every second for every human being.¬†

Here we will differentiate, big data and data science with various parameters. Before we start Big data vs Data science, let us see each one in detail.

## What Is Big Data? 

&amp;#x200B;

Big data is a humongous volume of data which cannot be effectively processed with the traditional apps that exist. The processing of Big Data starts with the raw data that isn‚Äôt aggregated and is generally difficult to store in the memory of a single computer. A popular expression that is utilized to describe massive volumes of data, both unstructured and structured, Big Data inundated a business on an everyday premise. Big Data is something that can be used to examine insights that can prompt better decisions and strategic business moves. By the definition- Big data is high-volume and high velocity or¬† high variety information asset that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that allow enhanced insights, decision making and process automation.

## What Is Data Science?

Managing unstructured and structured data, Data Science is a field that involves all that is related to data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. Data science is a combination of programming, problem-solving, statistics, mathematics, the ability to look at things in a different way, getting data in ingenious ways, data cleaning, aligning and preparing. In simple words, it is an umbrella of techniques that use to extract insights and information from data.

## Big Data Vs Data Science- What Is The Difference?

### 1. Perception-

Generally, big data is generated from multiple data sources and so it can be called a collective dataset. As the data set is made with data from multiple sources, each data type and data format is possible to add in big data. Big data can be Structured or unstructured or semi-structured datasets. Basically, a company or organization creates real time that insures the current status of an event and encourages them to work in a way to achieve the goal.

Data science includes multiple tools and techniques to analyse the dataset. Main goal of data science is to simplify the complexity of big data. Basically it is a concept made to reduce the difficulties in taking decisions for an organization. Considering big data vs data science, big data are unstructured and need to be simplified, whereas data science is a quick solution to it.

### 2. Platforms-

Big data is produced from each conceivable history that can be made in an event. The operation of producing data is started on platforms like DOMO, Hortonworks, Cloudera, Microsoft Machine Learning Server, Vertica, Kofax insight, AgileOne and so on.¬†

Data science works for the improvement of an organization through data analysis, process, preparation, and so on. Knowing the use and importance of data science, scientists started to work on it for the creation of detailed and accurate data science platform. After some attempts, many platforms are created and those are MATLAB, TIBCO statistica, Anaconda, H2O, R-Studio, Databricks Unified Analytics platforms and so on.

### 3. Tools-

Big data was introduced in 2005 and since then there has been developed many new and interesting tools that process data. These tools are Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra that work for SQL, graph processing, scalability etc. Hadoop by Apache can distributes huge amounts of data on different computers.¬†

Data science eases the decision making process for companies. Data scientists have developed the topic data science with different tools. Python programming, R programming, Tableau, Excel are some common examples with what data science can be explained. Statistical explanation and exponential development curves with the probability of an event can also be appeared with these tools.

### 4. Data Filtering-

Big data is expanding at a higher rate and never stops growing. But, it can assist with identifying the data which are important and which are less important. And it is called a data cleansing process. Dataset consists of huge data so it becomes so difficult to find out the detected data and analyze it by ownself. Although it is a harder process, big data helps in data cleaning through error data detection.

Data science is used to find the error and clean it. When data science is applied to big data, it helps to process, analyze and get the final result. From this, the summary of big data comes out and unwanted data remains¬† untouched. This remaining data will not be needed in future and it can be cleaned. In this way data science helps to keep internet clean by removing unnecessary data and finding out errors.

### 5. Relation With Cloud Computing-

The goal of big data is to serve as CEO and achieve business success whereas the goal of cloud computing is to serve as CIO in convenient and accurate IT solutions. When big data and cloud computing work together, business and IT-related success come rapidly and the efficiency becomes more rapid and smooth.¬† Big data can be stored on a cloud because cloud computing provides more storage and big data needs storage to get stored too.

When you work with data science, to find out accurate results, there is a need to apply algorithms. Clouds are advantageous with high computational needs and data storage. Data science requires more storage to store the analyzed data. Cloud computing is an easy solution for this.

## Applications Of Big Data-

1. Financial services
2. Telecommunications
3. Optimizing business processes
4. Performance optimization
5. Health and sports
6. Improving commerce
7. Research and Development
8. Security and law enforcement

## Applications Of Data Science-

1. Internet Search
2. Digital advertisements
3. Search recommenders
4. Speech/ Image recognition
5. Fraud, risk detection
6. Web development",9,bigdata,2020-10-13

j5cnhw,Need Advice: ELT pipeline/arch for semi-structured data,"Hi all- I have data coming in from a bunch of third-party APIs (on behalf of multiple customers) that I need to aggregate. Some of these, particularly Salesforce, can get very bespoke, depending on a user's configuration. I have schemas that are used to map these APIs together, which may be specific to a given user/API combo.

Right now, as an interim solution, I am storing JSON files in S3 with the output from the APIs. When needed, I pull the relevant files from S3, apply the transformations, and aggregate the output on demand. This was just to get an MVP out the door, and I know that it won't scale.

I have some idea of what the output looks like, but that will change, and I think that I'll at least need to keep the original output of the external API requests in order to handle future updates. I was thinking that keeping the original results around and starting to move this into Clickhouse with a batch operation (that applies the transforms to the then-current output format, against the raw data) could be an option, but I'm interested to hear if there's something that I'm missing with this approach. I don't know just how necessary it is to define a real table structure, or if I should just treat the API results as JSON blobs. I'm also looking at Apache Nifi to coordinate things.

j52unz,WHAT IS BIG DATA ANALYTICS?,"[Big Data Analytics](https://www.qubole.com/big-data-analytics/) offers a nearly endless source of business and informational insight, that can lead to operational improvement and new opportunities for companies to provide unrealized revenue across almost every industry. From use cases like customer personalization, to risk mitigation, to fraud detection, to internal operations analysis, and all the other new use cases arising near-daily, the Value hidden in company data has companies looking to create a cutting-edge analytics operation.

Discovering value within raw data poses many challenges for IT teams. Every company has different needs and different data assets. Business initiatives change quickly in an ever-accelerating marketplace, and keeping up with new directives can require agility and scalability. On top of that, a successful Big Data Analytics operation requires enormous computing resources, technological infrastructure, and highly skilled personnel.

All of these challenges can cause many operations to fail before they deliver value. In the past, a lack of computing power and access to automation made a true production-scale analytics operation beyond the reach of most companies: Big Data was too expensive, with too much hassle, and no clear ROI. With the rise of cloud computing and new technologies in compute resource management, Big Data tools are more accessible than ever before.  read more.....",0,bigdata,2020-10-13
j50jvn,Seeking recommendations for appropriate technologies for a social media app,"Hi Everyone. I have a programming background, though I did minor programming and focused more on business analysis and project management. I am now in a non-technology strategy role and it has been years since I last programmed or kept up with changing technology. I am looking to build a social media app (will outsource development to a full stack development outfit) and I will like to use an appropriate database(s) and programming languages from the get go that could support scaling the platform up - on the off chance the app is successful and has hundreds of millions of active users years down the road.  

Can anyone recommend appropriate databases, backend and frontend programming languages to consider, to ensure a responsive and scalable platform?  My concern is the amount of data that would need to be stored (for people's timelines, etc) and because people could potentially create a huge amount of data from their posts and comments.  I would appreciate any recommendations or suggestions. Thanks!",0,bigdata,2020-10-13

- ETL pipelines using APIs
- Gotten Too Complex because of additional features for Quick reruns
- Flow isn't generic and too much code written to handle errors

2. Collaborative Filtering will require no knowledge about user or product but there are also 2 different types. 
   1. Memory based - item item similarity

Consider that they don't have a centralized repository as of yet to hold that data and query it. 

Suppose they find a cloud data warehousing tool that has desktop client (instead of a cloud offering) that  allows creating dimensional models, prepare the data based on your business rules, and then use native connectivity to move the final, trusted data to popular cloud data warehouse service, like Redshift and Azure SQL DW.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem here is the historical data is in terabytes and petabytes that must be moved before workflows are developed to process and move the routinely procured data from various sources. 

What approach should be applied here? 

Do they buy hardware temporarily to store all that data and buy the tool to transform it, and after the data preparation has been completed, move it to the cloud with the native cloud connector?

Or do they ask the data warehousing vendor to take all of the data, store it in their own database, transform it, and then move it to the cloud for the company? (Like Snowball or Azure Databox)

Or what are the other ways to approach this?",4,bigdata,2020-10-13

Securing them properly is even harder. Since the configuration of these software products has become so complex, the time has come to treat these configurations like code and use static analysis tools to detect data breach risks and deviance from best practice automatically.

In fact, human error accounts for 22% of all data breaches in 2019 according to [Verizon‚Äôs data breach report.](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/)

We created a startup named Heinle Solutions and have developed such an analysis tool to fight this problem, with a growing proprietary database of checks. Come check us out at [www.heinlesolutions.com](http://www.heinlesolutions.com/)

I recently graduated business school, where I learned to do all my data analysis in Excel. Recently I've been using Python to analyze larger data sets. I've found that Python is missing the visual component that I get with Excel, but of course Excel cannot handle large data sets.

That is why I made [Mito](https://trymito.io/?source=r/bigdata)!

Mito is an editable spreadsheet inside your Jupyter Notebook. Editing the Mito spreadsheet generates Python code that you can re-use on any data set.

Now you can create repeatable analyses for your big data sets, all within a spreadsheet.

It's also a great way to learn Python, while leveraging your spreadsheet skills.

Keeping in mind, the amount of data being generated each day, the future scope of data science is bright, in fact, very bright. Students of technology, business, economics, mathematics, computer science, and the related subject domains, are all eligible to prepare for a data analyst role.

In the U.S., it is expected that there will exist 2.7 million openings for data science roles in 2020.

However, breaking into the said industry requires you to be extensively skilled, that, most are not. And hence, the need to enroll for big data analytics certifications. They allow you to attain the requisite skills quickly, with much lower capital investment and time, compared to the overwhelmingly high costs needed to be invested into attaining college degrees.

is8at8,[Research] What are the communities thoughts on Synthetic Data?,"Context: I‚Äôm completing a Masters Degree and my thesis is looking at the use of synthetic data; data which has been manufactured and not obtained naturally. I‚Äôve found many pain points in the use of real data, such as that of the quantity available, the quality of the data and the speed at which it can be obtained. Synthetic data generation would allow for rapidly generating as much data as you‚Äôd need in minutes/hours. 

There‚Äôs also the benefit that synthetic data is truly anonymous. Datasets are sampled row by row from the distribution of features in the real dataset, making it a good representation of the dataset but completely anonymous. Therefore not subject to all the strict privacy and data protection laws that are levied on data, often restricting its use and hindering research.

So I‚Äôm just wondering what the communities thoughts are on synthetic data for the purposes of prediction tasks. Would you adopt the use of synthetic data? If not why? Just trying to get a feeler for what the communities thoughts are on this really intriguing and interesting topic. 

I‚Äôve created a quiz, that‚Äôs somewhat inspired by the Turing test to see if people can work out which data is real and which is fake. The quiz contains more information about my project. If you fancy trying this the link is here: https://forms.gle/wj1YjV2fyFD6zheF7",1,bigdata,2020-10-13

So I'm curious how   google is using this information. I haven't been able to find anything   about it, but I find it hard to believe that Google wouldn't be using   comments to collect data on what people are thinking about.

If anyone knows anything about this topic, or could guide me to more info about it, that would be much appreciated.

Clearly, data analytics is important, but how is it different from data science? Companies often tend to use them interchangeably, but there is a difference. Both work with data, but a big data analyst looks through large data sets to find trends, create charts, and develop visual presentations that are used by businesses for strategic decision-making.

A data science professional, on the other hand, works on data modeling and production. He or she uses algorithms, custom analysis, predictive models, and prototypes to design and construct new processes to analyze the data.

I want to create a data repository, but I am having trouble deciding for the best approach.

 

**What I need:**

* a repository to import several datasets from different      institutions. (all summed up around 750gb-1tb);
* be able to clean these datasets and expand the      columns (feature creation and so on) - creating new views/tables;
* be able to apply ML on the (python or R)
* apply simple mechanics of data governance (giving      domain names to columns, lineage and nothing more, I believe)

 

**what i would want if possible:**

have a method for data not leaving the institutions. being on a landing zone type of schema and i would query on demand (with logging and access);

 

**NOTE:** data is all in relational data, there is no streaming, only a batch upload (first as only, or maybe a few more updates along the way)

 

What is the best arch for me? a simples RDBMS ? hadoop with hive and so on? dremio? denodo? delta lake?

Thank you!",2,bigdata,2020-10-13

Modern C++ is being used for a variety of scientific applications, and this environment can benefit considerably from graphics libraries that attend the typical design goals toward scientific data visualization. Besides the option of exporting results to other environments, the customary alternatives in C++ are either non-dedicated libraries that depend on existing user interfaces or bindings to other languages. Matplot++ is a graphics library for data visualization that provides interactive plotting, means for exporting plots in high-quality formats for scientific publications, a compact syntax consistent with similar libraries, dozens of plot categories with specialized algorithms, multiple coding styles, and supports generic backends.

Businesses are going digital with the potential to expand drastically. And over the past years, big data has been helping companies make better business decisions that have been accepted by the people. But if you don‚Äôt have the right talent to use big data and analytics, the company could go through a huge loss.

Today, a big data engineer and a data scientist are some of the most sought after job roles across the industry. From the finance to insurance sector, retail, and information technology, every industry has opened its doors for big data and analytics. Data engineers are professional who develops, constructs, tests, and maintains the architecture of a largescale processing system whereas big data engineers need to manage big data in the data management system. The role of data engineers has been upgraded. Now Big data engineers have to learn big data tools, frameworks, SQL databases to manage, design, and create the processing systems.

So I have recently found out that my contract is moving offshore and thus I'll be put on bench in my current contracting company. I have a few months before this will happen so I want to pack in as much knowledge as I can between now and then. When I'm on bench I'll have full access to some good training materials. So I'd really like to take advantage of all this. 

I have roughly 2.5 to 3 years experience and have a primary foundation on apache hadoop. I work mainly with Hive and unix as of right now.  I'm also familiar with splunk and yarn. The basic stuff. We have our own ETL tool which builds most things via GUI. my SQL is still very good besides that point though as my work involves manually testing what we build. 

What would be the best tools or skills to have? As of right now I'm spending a lot of time with bettering my foundational knowledge of the hadoop framework.I am also spending dedicated time to further my Unix scripting. Specifically with awk, sed, and regular expressions. But I would like to learn new tools and concepts to help further my career.

Any and all help or advice is GREATLY appreciated.

We have been using Cloudera Express for our cluster, and now that it no longer exists, along with other free alternatives like HDP, we are at a decision point.

\- Our cluster has to be in-house. Cloud isn't an option.

\- Management does not want to get 'stuck' in the latest free version in case there are potential critical vulnerability / bug fixes or improvements for individual Hadoop stack components.

\- Paid subscription does not seem to be an option for us in the near future. (I understand Cloudera's decision and want to thank them for all the services they provided free of charge so far)

After a bit of search, it looks like we will have to install/manage a cluster manually, without a management/installation solution like Cloudera's. Which we don't have much of an experience with, so I have a few questions:

\- How hard would this be for a smallish cluster of 20 to 40 nodes. (Human resources required to build and maintain such a cluster) Note that we only use a small subset of components: Hadoop, HBase, Spark, Kafka.

\- For those of you who have hand-rolled clusters: can I simply pull &amp; build a version of Hadoop, and other Hadoop components that are declared to be compatible with that version of Hadoop and expect all to work without major problems? Or are there intricacies and painful integration work that we may be underestimating?

\- Should I try using Ambari and build stacks for it instead of rolling it manually? Anyone have any experience or estimates on the difficulty of this path? I do understand that without Cloudera/HDP, who are one of the top contributors (or the top?), all these projects including Ambari will likely stagnate and this whole thing would be moot anyway, but I am not given many options.

\- Any other alternatives that I may have missed?

j8j0zb,Big Data Vs Data Science- What Is The Difference?," 

Data is everywhere. The amount of digital data that exists is rapidly increasing, doubling every two years, and changing the manner in which we live. Information is all over the place. Till the year 2020,about1,7 megabytes of new information will be generated every second for every human being.¬†

Here we will differentiate, big data and data science with various parameters. Before we start Big data vs Data science, let us see each one in detail.

## What Is Big Data? 

&amp;#x200B;

Big data is a humongous volume of data which cannot be effectively processed with the traditional apps that exist. The processing of Big Data starts with the raw data that isn‚Äôt aggregated and is generally difficult to store in the memory of a single computer. A popular expression that is utilized to describe massive volumes of data, both unstructured and structured, Big Data inundated a business on an everyday premise. Big Data is something that can be used to examine insights that can prompt better decisions and strategic business moves. By the definition- Big data is high-volume and high velocity or¬† high variety information asset that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that allow enhanced insights, decision making and process automation.

## What Is Data Science?

Managing unstructured and structured data, Data Science is a field that involves all that is related to data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. Data science is a combination of programming, problem-solving, statistics, mathematics, the ability to look at things in a different way, getting data in ingenious ways, data cleaning, aligning and preparing. In simple words, it is an umbrella of techniques that use to extract insights and information from data.

## Big Data Vs Data Science- What Is The Difference?

### 1. Perception-

Generally, big data is generated from multiple data sources and so it can be called a collective dataset. As the data set is made with data from multiple sources, each data type and data format is possible to add in big data. Big data can be Structured or unstructured or semi-structured datasets. Basically, a company or organization creates real time that insures the current status of an event and encourages them to work in a way to achieve the goal.

Data science includes multiple tools and techniques to analyse the dataset. Main goal of data science is to simplify the complexity of big data. Basically it is a concept made to reduce the difficulties in taking decisions for an organization. Considering big data vs data science, big data are unstructured and need to be simplified, whereas data science is a quick solution to it.

### 2. Platforms-

Big data is produced from each conceivable history that can be made in an event. The operation of producing data is started on platforms like DOMO, Hortonworks, Cloudera, Microsoft Machine Learning Server, Vertica, Kofax insight, AgileOne and so on.¬†

Data science works for the improvement of an organization through data analysis, process, preparation, and so on. Knowing the use and importance of data science, scientists started to work on it for the creation of detailed and accurate data science platform. After some attempts, many platforms are created and those are MATLAB, TIBCO statistica, Anaconda, H2O, R-Studio, Databricks Unified Analytics platforms and so on.

### 3. Tools-

Big data was introduced in 2005 and since then there has been developed many new and interesting tools that process data. These tools are Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra that work for SQL, graph processing, scalability etc. Hadoop by Apache can distributes huge amounts of data on different computers.¬†

Data science eases the decision making process for companies. Data scientists have developed the topic data science with different tools. Python programming, R programming, Tableau, Excel are some common examples with what data science can be explained. Statistical explanation and exponential development curves with the probability of an event can also be appeared with these tools.

### 4. Data Filtering-

Big data is expanding at a higher rate and never stops growing. But, it can assist with identifying the data which are important and which are less important. And it is called a data cleansing process. Dataset consists of huge data so it becomes so difficult to find out the detected data and analyze it by ownself. Although it is a harder process, big data helps in data cleaning through error data detection.

Data science is used to find the error and clean it. When data science is applied to big data, it helps to process, analyze and get the final result. From this, the summary of big data comes out and unwanted data remains¬† untouched. This remaining data will not be needed in future and it can be cleaned. In this way data science helps to keep internet clean by removing unnecessary data and finding out errors.

### 5. Relation With Cloud Computing-

The goal of big data is to serve as CEO and achieve business success whereas the goal of cloud computing is to serve as CIO in convenient and accurate IT solutions. When big data and cloud computing work together, business and IT-related success come rapidly and the efficiency becomes more rapid and smooth.¬† Big data can be stored on a cloud because cloud computing provides more storage and big data needs storage to get stored too.

When you work with data science, to find out accurate results, there is a need to apply algorithms. Clouds are advantageous with high computational needs and data storage. Data science requires more storage to store the analyzed data. Cloud computing is an easy solution for this.

1. Financial services
2. Telecommunications
3. Optimizing business processes
4. Performance optimization
5. Health and sports
6. Improving commerce
7. Research and Development
8. Security and law enforcement

My [new Apache Beam course](https://l.linklyhq.com/l/7jP6) is now available on [datastack.tv](https://datastack.tv)! This course tackles a single real-life batch data processing use case. Following topics are covered:

* Core concepts of the [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) framework
* How to design a pipeline in Apache Beam
* How to install Apache Beam locally
* How to build a real-world ETL pipeline in Apache Beam
* How to read and write CSV data from Apache Beam
* How to apply built-in and custom transformations on a dataset
* How to deploy your pipeline to Cloud Dataflow on Google Cloud

I tried to be concise and specific to this single use case. Note that this is not a comprehensive course but a great way of getting started with Apache Beam.

I'm planning to create further courses about Apache Beam transforms and a streaming use case.

If you take the course, let me know what you think!",5,bigdata,2020-10-13

j5cnhw,Need Advice: ELT pipeline/arch for semi-structured data,"Hi all- I have data coming in from a bunch of third-party APIs (on behalf of multiple customers) that I need to aggregate. Some of these, particularly Salesforce, can get very bespoke, depending on a user's configuration. I have schemas that are used to map these APIs together, which may be specific to a given user/API combo.

Right now, as an interim solution, I am storing JSON files in S3 with the output from the APIs. When needed, I pull the relevant files from S3, apply the transformations, and aggregate the output on demand. This was just to get an MVP out the door, and I know that it won't scale.

I have some idea of what the output looks like, but that will change, and I think that I'll at least need to keep the original output of the external API requests in order to handle future updates. I was thinking that keeping the original results around and starting to move this into Clickhouse with a batch operation (that applies the transforms to the then-current output format, against the raw data) could be an option, but I'm interested to hear if there's something that I'm missing with this approach. I don't know just how necessary it is to define a real table structure, or if I should just treat the API results as JSON blobs. I'm also looking at Apache Nifi to coordinate things.

j52unz,WHAT IS BIG DATA ANALYTICS?,"[Big Data Analytics](https://www.qubole.com/big-data-analytics/) offers a nearly endless source of business and informational insight, that can lead to operational improvement and new opportunities for companies to provide unrealized revenue across almost every industry. From use cases like customer personalization, to risk mitigation, to fraud detection, to internal operations analysis, and all the other new use cases arising near-daily, the Value hidden in company data has companies looking to create a cutting-edge analytics operation.

Discovering value within raw data poses many challenges for IT teams. Every company has different needs and different data assets. Business initiatives change quickly in an ever-accelerating marketplace, and keeping up with new directives can require agility and scalability. On top of that, a successful Big Data Analytics operation requires enormous computing resources, technological infrastructure, and highly skilled personnel.

All of these challenges can cause many operations to fail before they deliver value. In the past, a lack of computing power and access to automation made a true production-scale analytics operation beyond the reach of most companies: Big Data was too expensive, with too much hassle, and no clear ROI. With the rise of cloud computing and new technologies in compute resource management, Big Data tools are more accessible than ever before.  read more.....",0,bigdata,2020-10-13

- ETL pipelines using APIs
- Gotten Too Complex because of additional features for Quick reruns
- Flow isn't generic and too much code written to handle errors
- Stateful Systems with Sync Issues wastes too much time
- Manual Intervention to monitor the quality of data

Consider that they don't have a centralized repository as of yet to hold that data and query it. 

Suppose they find a cloud data warehousing tool that has desktop client (instead of a cloud offering) that  allows creating dimensional models, prepare the data based on your business rules, and then use native connectivity to move the final, trusted data to popular cloud data warehouse service, like Redshift and Azure SQL DW.

The problem here is the historical data is in terabytes and petabytes that must be moved before workflows are developed to process and move the routinely procured data from various sources. 

What approach should be applied here? 

Do they buy hardware temporarily to store all that data and buy the tool to transform it, and after the data preparation has been completed, move it to the cloud with the native cloud connector?

Or do they ask the data warehousing vendor to take all of the data, store it in their own database, transform it, and then move it to the cloud for the company? (Like Snowball or Azure Databox)

iytj7j,implementation suggestions from you guys,"Lets say I have a lot of IOT devices that send some meta attributes, I need some sort of a data analysis and ingestion solution, and data needs to be saved somewhere for it to be queried by other components in the system.

(the meta attributes is pretty much schema-less, but can be partitioned/normalized if needed)

current working solution is working with Elasticsearch for storing and querying the data, but the cluster is bloating fast and costs $$$ 

(all infrastructure hosted on AWS)

since I'm a developer that is new to the data world and the latest solutions and frameworks, please excuse me if I'm mixing apples and oranges here...

should I set up some sort of data pipeline and do the ingest/querying with Spark?  
{device sends attribute} -&gt; {some sort of transformation} -&gt; {save to AWS S3} 

what would be the proper approach here to achieve both scalability, maintain good query latency and keep the prices low

I recently graduated business school, where I learned to do all my data analysis in Excel. Recently I've been using Python to analyze larger data sets. I've found that Python is missing the visual component that I get with Excel, but of course Excel cannot handle large data sets.

That is why I made [Mito](https://trymito.io/?source=r/bigdata)!

Mito is an editable spreadsheet inside your Jupyter Notebook. Editing the Mito spreadsheet generates Python code that you can re-use on any data set.

Now you can create repeatable analyses for your big data sets, all within a spreadsheet.

It's also a great way to learn Python, while leveraging your spreadsheet skills.

Keeping in mind, the amount of data being generated each day, the future scope of data science is bright, in fact, very bright. Students of technology, business, economics, mathematics, computer science, and the related subject domains, are all eligible to prepare for a data analyst role.

In the U.S., it is expected that there will exist 2.7 million openings for data science roles in 2020.

However, breaking into the said industry requires you to be extensively skilled, that, most are not. And hence, the need to enroll for big data analytics certifications. They allow you to attain the requisite skills quickly, with much lower capital investment and time, compared to the overwhelmingly high costs needed to be invested into attaining college degrees.

is8at8,[Research] What are the communities thoughts on Synthetic Data?,"Context: I‚Äôm completing a Masters Degree and my thesis is looking at the use of synthetic data; data which has been manufactured and not obtained naturally. I‚Äôve found many pain points in the use of real data, such as that of the quantity available, the quality of the data and the speed at which it can be obtained. Synthetic data generation would allow for rapidly generating as much data as you‚Äôd need in minutes/hours. 

There‚Äôs also the benefit that synthetic data is truly anonymous. Datasets are sampled row by row from the distribution of features in the real dataset, making it a good representation of the dataset but completely anonymous. Therefore not subject to all the strict privacy and data protection laws that are levied on data, often restricting its use and hindering research.

So I‚Äôm just wondering what the communities thoughts are on synthetic data for the purposes of prediction tasks. Would you adopt the use of synthetic data? If not why? Just trying to get a feeler for what the communities thoughts are on this really intriguing and interesting topic. 

I‚Äôve created a quiz, that‚Äôs somewhat inspired by the Turing test to see if people can work out which data is real and which is fake. The quiz contains more information about my project. If you fancy trying this the link is here: https://forms.gle/wj1YjV2fyFD6zheF7",1,bigdata,2020-10-13

So I'm curious how   google is using this information. I haven't been able to find anything   about it, but I find it hard to believe that Google wouldn't be using   comments to collect data on what people are thinking about.

If anyone knows anything about this topic, or could guide me to more info about it, that would be much appreciated.

Clearly, data analytics is important, but how is it different from data science? Companies often tend to use them interchangeably, but there is a difference. Both work with data, but a big data analyst looks through large data sets to find trends, create charts, and develop visual presentations that are used by businesses for strategic decision-making.

A data science professional, on the other hand, works on data modeling and production. He or she uses algorithms, custom analysis, predictive models, and prototypes to design and construct new processes to analyze the data.

I want to create a data repository, but I am having trouble deciding for the best approach.

 

**What I need:**

* a repository to import several datasets from different      institutions. (all summed up around 750gb-1tb);
* be able to clean these datasets and expand the      columns (feature creation and so on) - creating new views/tables;
* be able to apply ML on the (python or R)
* apply simple mechanics of data governance (giving      domain names to columns, lineage and nothing more, I believe)

 

**what i would want if possible:**

have a method for data not leaving the institutions. being on a landing zone type of schema and i would query on demand (with logging and access);

 

**NOTE:** data is all in relational data, there is no streaming, only a batch upload (first as only, or maybe a few more updates along the way)

 

What is the best arch for me? a simples RDBMS ? hadoop with hive and so on? dremio? denodo? delta lake?

Thank you!",2,bigdata,2020-10-13

Modern C++ is being used for a variety of scientific applications, and this environment can benefit considerably from graphics libraries that attend the typical design goals toward scientific data visualization. Besides the option of exporting results to other environments, the customary alternatives in C++ are either non-dedicated libraries that depend on existing user interfaces or bindings to other languages. Matplot++ is a graphics library for data visualization that provides interactive plotting, means for exporting plots in high-quality formats for scientific publications, a compact syntax consistent with similar libraries, dozens of plot categories with specialized algorithms, multiple coding styles, and supports generic backends.

So I have recently found out that my contract is moving offshore and thus I'll be put on bench in my current contracting company. I have a few months before this will happen so I want to pack in as much knowledge as I can between now and then. When I'm on bench I'll have full access to some good training materials. So I'd really like to take advantage of all this. 

I have roughly 2.5 to 3 years experience and have a primary foundation on apache hadoop. I work mainly with Hive and unix as of right now.  I'm also familiar with splunk and yarn. The basic stuff. We have our own ETL tool which builds most things via GUI. my SQL is still very good besides that point though as my work involves manually testing what we build. 

What would be the best tools or skills to have? As of right now I'm spending a lot of time with bettering my foundational knowledge of the hadoop framework.I am also spending dedicated time to further my Unix scripting. Specifically with awk, sed, and regular expressions. But I would like to learn new tools and concepts to help further my career.

We have been using Cloudera Express for our cluster, and now that it no longer exists, along with other free alternatives like HDP, we are at a decision point.

\- Our cluster has to be in-house. Cloud isn't an option.

\- Management does not want to get 'stuck' in the latest free version in case there are potential critical vulnerability / bug fixes or improvements for individual Hadoop stack components.

\- Paid subscription does not seem to be an option for us in the near future. (I understand Cloudera's decision and want to thank them for all the services they provided free of charge so far)

After a bit of search, it looks like we will have to install/manage a cluster manually, without a management/installation solution like Cloudera's. Which we don't have much of an experience with, so I have a few questions:

\- How hard would this be for a smallish cluster of 20 to 40 nodes. (Human resources required to build and maintain such a cluster) Note that we only use a small subset of components: Hadoop, HBase, Spark, Kafka.

\- For those of you who have hand-rolled clusters: can I simply pull &amp; build a version of Hadoop, and other Hadoop components that are declared to be compatible with that version of Hadoop and expect all to work without major problems? Or are there intricacies and painful integration work that we may be underestimating?

\- Should I try using Ambari and build stacks for it instead of rolling it manually? Anyone have any experience or estimates on the difficulty of this path? I do understand that without Cloudera/HDP, who are one of the top contributors (or the top?), all these projects including Ambari will likely stagnate and this whole thing would be moot anyway, but I am not given many options.

\- Any other alternatives that I may have missed?

Data is everywhere. The amount of digital data that exists is rapidly increasing, doubling every two years, and changing the manner in which we live. Information is all over the place. Till the year 2020,about1,7 megabytes of new information will be generated every second for every human being.¬†

Here we will differentiate, big data and data science with various parameters. Before we start Big data vs Data science, let us see each one in detail.

## What Is Big Data? 

&amp;#x200B;

Big data is a humongous volume of data which cannot be effectively processed with the traditional apps that exist. The processing of Big Data starts with the raw data that isn‚Äôt aggregated and is generally difficult to store in the memory of a single computer. A popular expression that is utilized to describe massive volumes of data, both unstructured and structured, Big Data inundated a business on an everyday premise. Big Data is something that can be used to examine insights that can prompt better decisions and strategic business moves. By the definition- Big data is high-volume and high velocity or¬† high variety information asset that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that allow enhanced insights, decision making and process automation.

## What Is Data Science?

Managing unstructured and structured data, Data Science is a field that involves all that is related to data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. Data science is a combination of programming, problem-solving, statistics, mathematics, the ability to look at things in a different way, getting data in ingenious ways, data cleaning, aligning and preparing. In simple words, it is an umbrella of techniques that use to extract insights and information from data.

## Big Data Vs Data Science- What Is The Difference?

### 1. Perception-

Generally, big data is generated from multiple data sources and so it can be called a collective dataset. As the data set is made with data from multiple sources, each data type and data format is possible to add in big data. Big data can be Structured or unstructured or semi-structured datasets. Basically, a company or organization creates real time that insures the current status of an event and encourages them to work in a way to achieve the goal.

Data science includes multiple tools and techniques to analyse the dataset. Main goal of data science is to simplify the complexity of big data. Basically it is a concept made to reduce the difficulties in taking decisions for an organization. Considering big data vs data science, big data are unstructured and need to be simplified, whereas data science is a quick solution to it.

### 2. Platforms-

Big data is produced from each conceivable history that can be made in an event. The operation of producing data is started on platforms like DOMO, Hortonworks, Cloudera, Microsoft Machine Learning Server, Vertica, Kofax insight, AgileOne and so on.¬†

Data science works for the improvement of an organization through data analysis, process, preparation, and so on. Knowing the use and importance of data science, scientists started to work on it for the creation of detailed and accurate data science platform. After some attempts, many platforms are created and those are MATLAB, TIBCO statistica, Anaconda, H2O, R-Studio, Databricks Unified Analytics platforms and so on.

### 3. Tools-

Big data was introduced in 2005 and since then there has been developed many new and interesting tools that process data. These tools are Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra that work for SQL, graph processing, scalability etc. Hadoop by Apache can distributes huge amounts of data on different computers.¬†

Data science eases the decision making process for companies. Data scientists have developed the topic data science with different tools. Python programming, R programming, Tableau, Excel are some common examples with what data science can be explained. Statistical explanation and exponential development curves with the probability of an event can also be appeared with these tools.

### 4. Data Filtering-

Big data is expanding at a higher rate and never stops growing. But, it can assist with identifying the data which are important and which are less important. And it is called a data cleansing process. Dataset consists of huge data so it becomes so difficult to find out the detected data and analyze it by ownself. Although it is a harder process, big data helps in data cleaning through error data detection.

Data science is used to find the error and clean it. When data science is applied to big data, it helps to process, analyze and get the final result. From this, the summary of big data comes out and unwanted data remains¬† untouched. This remaining data will not be needed in future and it can be cleaned. In this way data science helps to keep internet clean by removing unnecessary data and finding out errors.

### 5. Relation With Cloud Computing-

The goal of big data is to serve as CEO and achieve business success whereas the goal of cloud computing is to serve as CIO in convenient and accurate IT solutions. When big data and cloud computing work together, business and IT-related success come rapidly and the efficiency becomes more rapid and smooth.¬† Big data can be stored on a cloud because cloud computing provides more storage and big data needs storage to get stored too.

When you work with data science, to find out accurate results, there is a need to apply algorithms. Clouds are advantageous with high computational needs and data storage. Data science requires more storage to store the analyzed data. Cloud computing is an easy solution for this.

My [new Apache Beam course](https://l.linklyhq.com/l/7jP6) is now available on [datastack.tv](https://datastack.tv)! This course tackles a single real-life batch data processing use case. Following topics are covered:

* Core concepts of the [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) framework
* How to design a pipeline in Apache Beam
* How to install Apache Beam locally
* How to build a real-world ETL pipeline in Apache Beam
* How to read and write CSV data from Apache Beam
* How to apply built-in and custom transformations on a dataset
* How to deploy your pipeline to Cloud Dataflow on Google Cloud

I tried to be concise and specific to this single use case. Note that this is not a comprehensive course but a great way of getting started with Apache Beam.

I'm planning to create further courses about Apache Beam transforms and a streaming use case.

j5cnhw,Need Advice: ELT pipeline/arch for semi-structured data,"Hi all- I have data coming in from a bunch of third-party APIs (on behalf of multiple customers) that I need to aggregate. Some of these, particularly Salesforce, can get very bespoke, depending on a user's configuration. I have schemas that are used to map these APIs together, which may be specific to a given user/API combo.

Right now, as an interim solution, I am storing JSON files in S3 with the output from the APIs. When needed, I pull the relevant files from S3, apply the transformations, and aggregate the output on demand. This was just to get an MVP out the door, and I know that it won't scale.

I have some idea of what the output looks like, but that will change, and I think that I'll at least need to keep the original output of the external API requests in order to handle future updates. I was thinking that keeping the original results around and starting to move this into Clickhouse with a batch operation (that applies the transforms to the then-current output format, against the raw data) could be an option, but I'm interested to hear if there's something that I'm missing with this approach. I don't know just how necessary it is to define a real table structure, or if I should just treat the API results as JSON blobs. I'm also looking at Apache Nifi to coordinate things.

From use cases like customer personalization, to risk mitigation, to fraud detection, to internal operations analysis, and all the other new use cases arising near-daily, the Value hidden in company data has companies looking to create a cutting-edge analytics operation.

Discovering value within raw data poses many challenges for IT teams. Every company has different needs and different data assets. Business initiatives change quickly in an ever-accelerating marketplace, and keeping up with new directives can require agility and scalability. On top of that, a successful Big Data Analytics operation requires enormous computing resources, technological infrastructure, and highly skilled personnel.

All of these challenges can cause many operations to fail before they deliver value. In the past, a lack of computing power and access to automation made a true production-scale analytics operation beyond the reach of most companies: Big Data was too expensive, with too much hassle, and no clear ROI. With the rise of cloud computing and new technologies in compute resource management, Big Data tools are more accessible than ever before.  read more.....",0,bigdata,2020-10-13

Consider that they don't have a centralized repository as of yet to hold that data and query it. 

Suppose they find a cloud data warehousing tool that has desktop client (instead of a cloud offering) that  allows creating dimensional models, prepare the data based on your business rules, and then use native connectivity to move the final, trusted data to popular cloud data warehouse service, like Redshift and Azure SQL DW.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem here is the historical data is in terabytes and petabytes that must be moved before workflows are developed to process and move the routinely procured data from various sources. 

What approach should be applied here? 

Do they buy hardware temporarily to store all that data and buy the tool to transform it, and after the data preparation has been completed, move it to the cloud with the native cloud connector?

Or do they ask the data warehousing vendor to take all of the data, store it in their own database, transform it, and then move it to the cloud for the company? (Like Snowball or Azure Databox)

Or what are the other ways to approach this?",3,bigdata,2020-10-13

current working solution is working with Elasticsearch for storing and querying the data, but the cluster is bloating fast and costs $$$

since I'm a developer that is new to the data world and the latest solutions and frameworks, please excuse me if I'm mixing apples and oranges here...

should I set up some sort of data pipeline and do the ingest/querying with Spark?

That is why I made [Mito](https://trymito.io/?source=r/bigdata)!

Mito is an editable spreadsheet inside your Jupyter Notebook. Editing the Mito spreadsheet generates Python code that you can re-use on any data set.

Now you can create repeatable analyses for your big data sets, all within a spreadsheet.

Keeping in mind, the amount of data being generated each day, the future scope of data science is bright, in fact, very bright. Students of technology, business, economics, mathematics, computer science, and the related subject domains, are all eligible to prepare for a data analyst role.

In the U.S., it is expected that there will exist 2.7 million openings for data science roles in 2020.

However, breaking into the said industry requires you to be extensively skilled, that, most are not. And hence, the need to enroll for big data analytics certifications. They allow you to attain the requisite skills quickly, with much lower capital investment and time, compared to the overwhelmingly high costs needed to be invested into attaining college degrees.

I‚Äôve found many pain points in the use of real data, such as that of the quantity available, the quality of the data and the speed at which it can be obtained. Synthetic data generation would allow for rapidly generating as much data as you‚Äôd need in minutes/hours. 

There‚Äôs also the benefit that synthetic data is truly anonymous. Datasets are sampled row by row from the distribution of features in the real dataset, making it a good representation of the dataset but completely anonymous. Therefore not subject to all the strict privacy and data protection laws that are levied on data, often restricting its use and hindering research.

So I‚Äôm just wondering what the communities thoughts are on synthetic data for the purposes of prediction tasks. Would you adopt the use of synthetic data? If not why? Just trying to get a feeler for what the communities thoughts are on this really intriguing and interesting topic. 

I‚Äôve created a quiz, that‚Äôs somewhat inspired by the Turing test to see if people can work out which data is real and which is fake. The quiz contains more information about my project. If you fancy trying this the link is here: https://forms.gle/wj1YjV2fyFD6zheF7",1,bigdata,2020-10-13

So I'm curious how   google is using this information. I haven't been able to find anything   about it, but I find it hard to believe that Google wouldn't be using   comments to collect data on what people are thinking about.

ipec2x,Big Data Analyst vs Data Science Professional ‚Äì what you must know,"Geoffrey Moore, American management consultant, and author, once said: ‚ÄúWithout big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out on to the web like deer on a freeway.‚Äù

Clearly, data analytics is important, but how is it different from data science? Companies often tend to use them interchangeably, but there is a difference. Both work with data, but a big data analyst looks through large data sets to find trends, create charts, and develop visual presentations that are used by businesses for strategic decision-making.

A data science professional, on the other hand, works on data modeling and production. He or she uses algorithms, custom analysis, predictive models, and prototypes to design and construct new processes to analyze the data.

I want to create a data repository, but I am having trouble deciding for the best approach.

 

**What I need:**

* a repository to import several datasets from different      institutions. (all summed up around 750gb-1tb);
* be able to clean these datasets and expand the      columns (feature creation and so on) - creating new views/tables;
* be able to apply ML on the (python or R)
* apply simple mechanics of data governance (giving      domain names to columns, lineage and nothing more, I believe)

 

**what i would want if possible:**

have a method for data not leaving the institutions. being on a landing zone type of schema and i would query on demand (with logging and access);

 

**NOTE:** data is all in relational data, there is no streaming, only a batch upload (first as only, or maybe a few more updates along the way)

 

What is the best arch for me? a simples RDBMS ? hadoop with hive and so on? dremio? denodo? delta lake?

Thank you!",2,bigdata,2020-10-13

Modern C++ is being used for a variety of scientific applications, and this environment can benefit considerably from graphics libraries that attend the typical design goals toward scientific data visualization. Besides the option of exporting results to other environments, the customary alternatives in C++ are either non-dedicated libraries that depend on existing user interfaces or bindings to other languages. Matplot++ is a graphics library for data visualization that provides interactive plotting, means for exporting plots in high-quality formats for scientific publications, a compact syntax consistent with similar libraries, dozens of plot categories with specialized algorithms, multiple coding styles, and supports generic backends.

And over the past years, big data has been helping companies make better business decisions that have been accepted by the people. But if you don‚Äôt have the right talent to use big data and analytics, the company could go through a huge loss.

Today, a big data engineer and a data scientist are some of the most sought after job roles across the industry. From the finance to insurance sector, retail, and information technology, every industry has opened its doors for big data and analytics. Data engineers are professional who develops, constructs, tests, and maintains the architecture of a largescale processing system whereas big data engineers need to manage big data in the data management system. The role of data engineers has been upgraded. Now Big data engineers have to learn big data tools, frameworks, SQL databases to manage, design, and create the processing systems.

So I have recently found out that my contract is moving offshore and thus I'll be put on bench in my current contracting company. I have a few months before this will happen so I want to pack in as much knowledge as I can between now and then. When I'm on bench I'll have full access to some good training materials. So I'd really like to take advantage of all this. 

I have roughly 2.5 to 3 years experience and have a primary foundation on apache hadoop. I work mainly with Hive and unix as of right now.  I'm also familiar with splunk and yarn. The basic stuff. We have our own ETL tool which builds most things via GUI. my SQL is still very good besides that point though as my work involves manually testing what we build. 

What would be the best tools or skills to have? As of right now I'm spending a lot of time with bettering my foundational knowledge of the hadoop framework.I am also spending dedicated time to further my Unix scripting. Specifically with awk, sed, and regular expressions. But I would like to learn new tools and concepts to help further my career.

Any and all help or advice is GREATLY appreciated.

We have been using Cloudera Express for our cluster, and now that it no longer exists, along with other free alternatives like HDP, we are at a decision point.

\- Our cluster has to be in-house. Cloud isn't an option.

\- Management does not want to get 'stuck' in the latest free version in case there are potential critical vulnerability / bug fixes or improvements for individual Hadoop stack components.

\- Paid subscription does not seem to be an option for us in the near future. (I understand Cloudera's decision and want to thank them for all the services they provided free of charge so far)

After a bit of search, it looks like we will have to install/manage a cluster manually, without a management/installation solution like Cloudera's. Which we don't have much of an experience with, so I have a few questions:

\- How hard would this be for a smallish cluster of 20 to 40 nodes. (Human resources required to build and maintain such a cluster) Note that we only use a small subset of components: Hadoop, HBase, Spark, Kafka.

\- For those of you who have hand-rolled clusters: can I simply pull &amp; build a version of Hadoop, and other Hadoop components that are declared to be compatible with that version of Hadoop and expect all to work without major problems? Or are there intricacies and painful integration work that we may be underestimating?

\- Should I try using Ambari and build stacks for it instead of rolling it manually? Anyone have any experience or estimates on the difficulty of this path? I do understand that without Cloudera/HDP, who are one of the top contributors (or the top?), all these projects including Ambari will likely stagnate and this whole thing would be moot anyway, but I am not given many options.

\- Any other alternatives that I may have missed?

j9lwmj,Which way Of Installing Hadoop is Efficient and Good for a Beginner?,"Actually, i am a beginner and want to explore Hadoop Ecosystem. I had a doubt regarding which is the best and efficient way to install and use Hadoop :

1.Using Hortonworks or Cloudera Based Hadoop Installation on Virtual Box or Virtual Machine

2.Installing Apache Hadoop directly on Local PC with JAVA using Ubuntu     


Also, would like to know if I install and implement on Hortonworks based Hadoop using Virtual Box, do I have to learn something more in the future when I will work in Big IT Firms or Companies?",3,bigdata,2020-10-13

j9g61r,Help with big data test please?,"Hi guys, 

I was wondering if someone could help answer the following question:

""Hadoop has been described as the best solution we have for dealing with big data so far. What two paradigms (=approaches) does it use that make it so useful for dealing with large data sets? Name each and explain wit the approach helps processing large data sets.""

After half an hour of googling I concluded that they are parallelisation and sequential processes but I would like to double check (please correct me if I was wrong) because I don't want to fail the subject. Thanks guys!

EDIT: or is it storage and processing?",1,bigdata,2020-10-13
