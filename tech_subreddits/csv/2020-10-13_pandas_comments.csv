c35nywi,mjpma,Can you share some observations about panda behavior that you've gathered over the last five years? Anything surprising?,1
c35splm,mjpma,"They are as fun as they are fluffy.  If you were to make a cage out of bamboo and put them in it, they would eat their way out.  9 out of 10 zookeepers wish they had their own pet panda.  The other 1 out of 10 zookeepers were too embarrassed to admit that they wanted their own pet panda.  All pandas are cool.",2
c361227,mjpma,Excellent report. Thank you. Did you actually see any pandas eat their way out of a bamboo cage? Is that a regular thing the zoo does to entertain people?,1
c363caw,mjpma,"That was actually a personal experience... I participated in rent-a-panda last year for a 3-day span and I had only considered buying the food supply, not the caging in preparation for the panda's arrival.  So as a last-ditch effort, I assembled a cage out the bamboo food supply.  He was much happier in the cage than in the semi they delivered him with, but after assembling the cage I had little bamboo to spare.  I managed to keep him fed with non-cage bamboo for the first two days... then it all went to hell. Long story short- I ended up chasing a panda down the streets of Milwaukee riding my moped in my underwear at 3 in the morning.",2
