j7v1nv,[AskJS] Would you use this? [MIT licensed framework]," 

I came across a web developer that told me had developed a framework for building web apps very simply and quick about a year ago. He asked me to check it out, but I'm not a web coder; Ive coded mostly back-end stuff on large scale systems etc, and am now working more towards management.

I checked out his github etc and to me it looks clean and structured. I'm very curious if this framework is worth it's time, or it's just ""another framework"".

Would anyone care to check out this, and possibly give a feedback on how it looks like andv performs? It would bestill my curiosity a bit, and finally I can get some sleep...

It's called waveorb:

(Im not the person that has developed this, btw. And I am in no position to gain anything from any use of it in any way. I'm just very curious. The guy seemed genuinly like a person that knows what he is doing.)

j7qa8s,"[AskJS] Has Cypress ever been using for both ""unit"" and e2e testing?","Whether this has been done before or not, I'm going to try to implement it. I'm just wondering if there is prior art out there to reference. Also, feedback on the idea in general would be appreciated.

**Background**

So, I've done a lot of unit testing with tools like Jest/Enzyme, and I've done e2e testing with Cypress and Selenium. I hate Selenium and love Cypress, btw. Given that I am a strong opponent of snapshot testing with Jest/Enzyme, I find myself writing similar logic in both Jest and Cypress. For example, when I have a presentational component, I'll write Jest logic that tests that the fields render properly for the data I pass in as props. Then, in my Cypress e2e testing, I'll write basically the same thing, but for Cypress.

In addition, I've been embracing the philosophy of integration tests over unit tests, relying on tests that do a more thorough job of testing the application's actual full behavior rather than just narrow pieces of it. Doesn't mean I don't write unit tests anymore, they just tend to be a smaller percentage of my overall test suite.

**My Goal**

I want to write a Cypress test suite that can serve as both ""integration"" style tests and my e2e tests, eliminating nearly all the need to use Jest/Enzyme. Here's a rough overview of how I'm planning to have it work. Keep in mind that a lot of the ideas here are pretty rough and I have not dove too deep into the planning of this project.

**Integration Tests**

1. My React app would need to be mounted somehow, preferably headless so this could run in a CI/CD pipeline.
2. Cypress would run headless (I know it can do that).
3. On initialization, code would run that would mock all API calls, so they wouldn't go anywhere.  

   1. This is the only piece of the app that gets mocked, everything else is the full end-to-end logic.
4. Cypress tests would then ""click"" through the app, relying on the mocked data to handle API responses, validating the UI in the process.

**End to End Tests**

1. Same exact Cypress suite as before, just with some configuration changes.
2. Cypress runs headless against a live version of the app with real (qa) data and real interactions with other services.
3. No APIs are mocked.
4. Cypress tests will properly validate the running application.

**Final Thoughts**

As you can see, the objective is to have one Cypress suite that can both do integration testing against mock data, and actual testing of the live app. I feel these kind of tests will be more robust than Jest/Enzyme unit tests, and since they are re-usable for the e2e tests they have the added benefit of decreasing the overall time spent on testing (unit + e2e tests being written simultaneously). Obviously I would expect some errors to occur when running one way vs another, but it would still be a time saver without sacrificing test coverage.

This is not to say I would expect this to replace all unit tests. There are still plenty of cases where normal unit tests are still essential, such as some fancy TypeScript dynamic type checking logic I wrote recently. However, I really do like the overall direction I'm trying to go in here.

Alright, this wall of text is done. It's late and I'm going to bed. Appreciate both being pointed to prior art that's out there and feedback on the overall idea.",7,javascript,2020-10-13

However, whenever I'm presented with a programming problem during interviews, katas (e.g. write a factorial function), I tend to get intimidated by the problem and suddenly feel stuck and don't know where to begin with solving the problem. These problems aren't even complex, but I just panic at not knowing how to approach it.  

I think with my work being very framework-focused, I tend to be very good at using the framework and have neglected basic programming skills. 

How do I become better at solving code challenges?
I tried brute forcing it by trying to do 1 kata a day, but I still end up with the same issue. I think I need to know how to THINK about the problem first.

j60yz8,[AskJS] Node react vs .net blazor,"Choosing a stack. One of the most difficult task. I work as a .net c# full stack developer for some months, earlier I worked on react redux. I want to build an app in my free time. Web platform with separated back and front end plus mobile edition. Maybe microservices based or servereless. I think I'll put most of the logic in front end which for a public facing app is also so important and I want front end to have great UX. I was mostly back end.

Why 1st stack: JavaScript for all. React is way more popular than blazor so many libraries documentation etc. Nodejs simplicity with great support on AWS servereless and react native to get mobile app done.

Why 2nd stack. C# is great. I'm gaining experience in .net from my day job. Blazor looks easy for a c# developer. Xamarin looks more popular than react native. Great ecosystem and tools.

Why not 1st stack. JavaScript becomes ugly as the project expands and difficult. I'm better on c# . Dynamic language can become messy.

Why not 2nd stack: Windows sucks. (I prefer macos but if I go c# way I want visual studio no rider etc.) C# half of code is models hell. Blazor is new so no support and community yet. Not so popular for serverless. So weak UX for front end.

**A)** When you know you're a senior Javascript developer ?
 
 
**B)** Is it possible to be ""senior"" without being Full Stack for example being just Frontend or just Backend or for the old programmer being full stack really mean being senior and understanding the whole picture better ?
 
 
**C)** Why many Java and C# programmer dislike and avoid Javascript a lot ? are they stuck with their old mentalities and are afraid to learn new things or ? Keep reading on others thread that WebAssembly will be ""the thing"" etc
 
 
**D)** Does the industry standardized on VSCode or the alternative IDE are just as good ? is it possible today in 2020 to completly disable the Telemetry in VSCode ?


**E)** Does anyone have experience here working 100% remote as a JS dev in the USA but living in Canada ? Work permit, currency conversion, taxes etc etc all that jazz

\- User has to choose input from various a lists of options.

\- There will be a box with labels containing chosen options.

\- An svg is generated with those options along with controls for using it.

\- There will be optional premium access, with benefits such as embeding the svg with controls into your page, so i also need to integrate a pay system. Was thinking about banked.js that also uses web components.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i've managed to do all this without frameworks and using IIFE mostly for encapsulation, but i'd like to restructure the entire project as i'm realizing how inconvenient this is as the project grows in complexity . I have read lots of reddit post about WC and it seems the waters are divided.

A lot of people say they don't solve the problems and they have failed and nobody uses them and others says they are a good way to keep project simple and minimalist. Also there are big companies that use web components for their frontend apps.

I'd like to have an actual and well-founded insight of Web Components and their use cases.

iwmbvd,[AskJS] Semicolons: yes or no?,"Personally, I like the syntax of no semicolons, I think it looks cleaner, but that's just me.

Someone told me that the parser adds missing semicolons at runtime, so it actually creates extra effort for the browser to interpret your code, but I never fact checked that it's actually extra work.  To be honest, even if it is, I kind of doubt it creates enough extra work to justify adding them specifically as a micro-optimization.

But, maybe I'm completely wrong on that.  What say you?  Is there some reason beyond preference to use them or avoid using them?  What's your preference?

\--

UPDATE: Well, since this is blowing up a fair bit, I figured it might be good to update the OP with some more relevant information.

Looks like there are actually edge cases where semicolons cause errors, which I didn't account for when I authored this post.  Most of these edge cases arise from starting lines with typically unusual characters, which can be [easily addressed by ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unexpected-multiline).  There's a few more which, to me, would seem more deliberately messed up rather than inadvertent, like in the head of for loops.

What's even more interesting is [TC39 recently recommended their explicit usage](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1062).  It's not a suggestion that omitting them is not future proof, but they are saying that future syntax may require semicolons in some additional edge cases.  This caused some popcorn-worthy debate in the comments of the github issue.  Seriously go have a read, haha.

[In this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkqyDM28y4A), even big league developers got at each others' throats over it.  I had no idea I was opening such a can of worms, but I'm having fun with the conversation!

I've also mentioned in the comments that I'm not stuck-up about my preference.  I'll gladly go along with the team's style-guide and put my preference to the wayside, in the name of consistency (and not being a jerk, I guess.)  But I still enjoy the minimalism of it, myself.  I think it's at minimum, acceptable, as long as the proper lint rules are in place.  And I also think explicitly using them all the time is valid.",40,javascript,2020-10-13

ivovq6,[AskJS] Paperjs stops redrawing after loading another script,"

I'm using paper js to draw an animated set of rectagles. Since there will be several html pages in this project, I tried adding the menu html programmatically using javascript. However, once the menu script loads, paper js stops redrawing.

I used a timer to delay the loading of the menu script to ascertain if it was any other issue. The animation definitely plays normally right before the menu script loads.

Any other element added programmatically works fine. It's only paper that stops redrawing.

How do I fix this?

iozfw8,[AskJS] Browser hosted websites using WebRTC?,"Would it be possible to run a website using WebRTC? So it behaves like a website but all the assets/requests are done using WebRTC? So you can quickly host a website without having costs on the server side. (Except the WebRTC signaling)

One idea i had would be to check for the mime-type of the file and if its a html file, replace some elements (img, script, link ect.) with a custom Webcomponent which gets the resource through WebRTC. And for fetch/xhr inject hooks which do the same.

The idea is that you can host a website to show your friends or just to play around with no cost. Ofc this is not usefull for bigger websites but its a idea i had.

I know about dweb but as far as i know they do such things with a custom browser and using blockchain.

I am wondering what the most clear way to relate data with the functionality that is applied to it?

ihqmvm,[AskJS] object destructuring vs dot notation. Performance and cohesiveness.,"Organisation which I have recently joined, most of the code is written using object destructuring like `const {a, b, c} = this.props `.

This approach causes readability problems when function body is long and at the bottom of function you just loose track of origin of variables and it becomes hard to understand whether they are coming from props or state. 

And considering that I prefer to use dot notations like `this.props.a` but that seems frowned here. 

My one colleague has also shared performance comparison.

igwujw,[AskJS] Is JavaScript that bad or it is just me that do not have enough experience on it?,"Guys,

I do not want to start a war of unreasonable arguments. I have a bad feeling right now after being working in a JS project for several weeks. And just want to hear your opinion / suggestions.

This is also a way to vent , so please don't be too hard on me.

1 - My background:

\- I've been working for 5+ years as a software developer. My experience is mainly with Java (Spring and Android) and with Objective-C and Swift on (iOS). All static typed languages (Well, Objective-C is a mixture, but I use it assuming it is statically typed) .

2 - The project:

The project I've been working on is a web console for a product. It is a Single Page Application done with Backbone.js + Marionette. And all the new features have been created using VueJs. It is a well medium to large sized project.

3 - My frustrations:

\- When calling methods with a large quantity of parameters, in Java or Objective-C I usually prefer to create an object that holds all the needed parameters. When refactoring or improving the code, it is easy to see what parameters and types are expected. In this project, It took me a lot to determine the needed parameters as sometimes they are passed as single arguments, and other times are passed within objects. I had to go to the method call to see what parameters were being sent, which leds me to my next frustration

\- IDE does not find method callers: Seems that there is not enough information in the language so the IDE is unable to determine exactly who is calling a method. It does it correctly when the method is called within the same ""class"", but it seems it is limited to perform a literal method name search in other parts of the project, which leads to wrong results as many times there are methods that have the same name but pertain to different modules. (I am using JetBrains WebStorm). Frustrating!

\- This is probably the worst one: lack of type information, prevents the linter from finding obvious mistakes. I have lost many hours fixing stupid mistakes due to the lack (or loss) of type information for the linter. Calling not existing methods, or performing invalid operations on objects that do not have certain properties is something that statically typed languages will detect right away, and it REALLY speeds me up as a developer. (Languages are for humans, not for the machines)

\- Version incompatibilities: Backbone.js does not use SemVer (yeah, I know!), and apart of that rogue dependency all other dependencies seem to respect SemVer which is good. However there are certain incompatibilities between packages that are not explicitly declared anywhere but in each package documentation (and not always). I know that this  is not a problem inherently existing in JavaScript projects, this also happens in Java or Objective-C, however, I have **over 100  dependencies**. THe project was tied to VERY old versions  with lots of security issues and it took me about 4 days to update every one of them to the latest versions. This was because many of them required major version updates, which obligated me to make changes in the code or in the webpack build parameters. Many of the most time-consuming dependencies were related to WebPack and babel. Don't get me wrong, Babel is a blessing as I no longer have to deal with each single browser compatibility issue, but the burden of having all set up is quite high!

\- Debugging: I am used to debug in the same IDE. Console messages, breakpoints and debug information appear in the very same IDE. Well I spent some hours configuring this so I do not need to use Chrome console. Unfortunately the result was that the ""breaking"" line in the IDE was not in sync with the actual line that was being executed by the Chrome JavaScript Engine. So I ended up using the Chrome dev tools. Grrrr

My thoughts:

\- Let's be clear: you can create bad code with any language. But JavaScript allows you to create HORRIBLE code. I know that in this project I am working there is a lot of legacy code that is the result of the lack of experience of the first programmers with the language / frameworks, but certain practices are just horrible, and JavaScript allows them.

\- The lack of type information is a burden. I am exploring TypeScript, however there is a lot of code that will never me migrated and need to take a decision about how to tackle that issue.

\- Probably this is happening because the web as a platform has been heavily transformed in the last 15+ years. I mean, that is great. But I feel a like living a little hell.

The senior dev cut a PR for a fairly big feature and as I was reviewing I noticed an absence of error handling and there wasn’t any tests. No catch blocks anywhere. Otherwise, the PR looked great. I added a comment to add error handling and tests and we should be good to go.

They DM me a minute later on Slack to tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about and HTTP errors are the concern of the backend devs, which we should open tickets for. He said tests are just ""confidence building busywork"" and the team should trust his 20+ year expertise.

ifn7ow,[AskJS] What are good animation libraries for CSS ?,"A few weeks or month ago, I have read a very interesting blog post or tutorial about a javascript animation library for CSS (not animating in a canvas).  The library was of the functional programming kind.  If I remember well, some examples were about moving blue dots, first one, than many (in parallel, with delays, …).  l lost the link.  Could someone post the link to the blog or tutorial, or to the animation library itself?

icul6f,[AskJS] What coding nightmares have woken you up at night?,"Last night I dreamed that I had been working on an open-sourced JavaScript representation of the US Government, a couple rogue admins on the project began merging PRs from a number of devs that wanted to undermine the system, and the entire thing began to degrade in quality and spaghettify to the point where it was nearly impossible to refactor.

The rogue admins even began overwriting the repo's commit history. I woke up in a cold sweat, then felt relieved that it was just a dream.

It was a nightmare, but I'd honestly be interested in working on a project like that (sans the rogue actors).

Anyway thanks for listening. What coding nightmare has woken you up at night?

ic693w,[AskJS] Would you be willing to take on a mentee for javascript? Someone to commit to helping advance towards a bright career?,"Hey,

I've noticed that within the learnprogramming community, one of the main pain points seems to be that early-stage/beginner devs consistently get stuck. They:  


  
\- Take on projects that are too large in scope  
\- Get stuck on pretty trivial bugs that absorb days of their time  
\- Don't know which technologies to learn/invest in  
\- Have many broader career/job application questions  
\- Don't know what it's like on the inside (actually being a dev)  


And that they would benefit tremendously from having a mentor (say 30 min/2 weeks cadence) coaching them on the above points.

Is it that difficult to retrofit a restricted content system into their server? Or is it just not enough of a problem, that people don't know how to turn off their Javascript? It just seems like such a clumsy solution to me if you can turn it off with the click of a button.

The idea is, that they open a web app, where they can drag and drop some HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Then some tests will be run against them and they get a test report in the end.

2) A framework specific library developed to work only on target framework like ElementUI for Vue, Ant-Design for React

i8mkbt,[AskJS] What is best practice for a large organization share NPM packages?,"We have tons of different projects which each as their own git repo, npm module and dependencies.

My boss said that I could propose some ideas for how to share some of this code, but I can't seem to find what the best practices are. Mono-repo is \*out of the question\*, and I'd like it to be a statically-linked solution, not runtime loaded (think sharing common proprietary utility functions, DTOs, math functions, etc.). Open sourcing this code as a public npm package is out of the question too.

i85sm8,[AskJS] Redux vs React Hooks - A point I haven't seen brought up,"So I've been debating whether I should be implementing hooks more since their inception, and recently at my place of employment, I realized that I lean heavily towards using Redux vs Hooks + Context for a couple major reasons. One is the age of Redux and things like the dev tools which make it super simple to debug (I've had to spin up my own logger and diff checker for my reducer hooks), but the other large reason I haven't seen anyone mention is that hooks tie you into React and React alone.

If eventually you need to move your code base over to another framework/library, you can't transfer the application state with you as easily. Because Redux is framework agnostic, you can always just hook into it from your new framework/library of choice.

I've recently had to deal with this at my company with migrating from Angular 1 to React, with all of the state logic being in Angular 1. We're now putting the logic into Redux so that in the future, if we ever have to migrate again, our state logic stays solid and makes the migration that much easier.

With all this being said, I'm starting at a new company in a month where they are much more hooks heavy, so I'm excited to see how they do things and learn their approaches :)

i7rpjt,[AskJS] Multiple returns vs. single point of exit with switch - which is more readable here?," Multiple returns:

    function multipleReturns(value) {

            case 'case2': return functionB();

            case 'case4': return functionD();

        return result;
    }

An interesting discussion recently came up at work when code reviewing. My colleague often favors a single point of exit, I often prefer using multiple returns.

Reading about this it seems that it's mostly a matter of context and preference.

I'm not so concerned with the actual implementation of i18n at a component level. My interest is more in how to manage the dictionaries (and loading of them) for large apps.

For context, our existing app (currently server-rendered, traditional round-trip http request style) has thousands of phrases - it's a very large app. We're looking to gradually move to client-side rendering. But how are languages managed in this situation? I can't imagine sending the entire dictionary with the first request is viable. Should translations be lazy-loaded along with the components they are used in - and if so, are there existing implementations that support that out of the box? Or are there other approaches I may be overlooking?

i3guet,[AskJS] Code Review Disagreement,"Having a bit of trouble at work with a code review that's gone a bit weird.

Basically, this is the top-level export of a package we have. The package is an ""api client"" that knows how to communicate with our API endpoints

First thing i did was remove the Promise. Remember this module is the top-level module in the package. It is set as the ""main"" field in \`package.json\`

Removing the promise has set off a bit of disagreement.

I'm trying not to lead the responses here but do any people see the problem with exporting promises as top-level package exports?

Surely I can implement something for my case but I was expecting to have a defacto logging framework as log4net for C#. No need to reinvent the wheel if I don't have to.

j7v1nv,[AskJS] Would you use this? [MIT licensed framework]," 

I came across a web developer that told me had developed a framework for building web apps very simply and quick about a year ago. He asked me to check it out, but I'm not a web coder; Ive coded mostly back-end stuff on large scale systems etc, and am now working more towards management.

I checked out his github etc and to me it looks clean and structured. I'm very curious if this framework is worth it's time, or it's just ""another framework"".

Would anyone care to check out this, and possibly give a feedback on how it looks like andv performs? It would bestill my curiosity a bit, and finally I can get some sleep...

It's called waveorb:  
[https://waveorb.com/](https://waveorb.com/)

Github:

[https://github.com/eldoy/waveorb](https://github.com/eldoy/waveorb)

(Im not the person that has developed this, btw. And I am in no position to gain anything from any use of it in any way. I'm just very curious. The guy seemed genuinly like a person that knows what he is doing.)

Thanks in advance. I hope this is not off-topic - I checked the rules and couldn't see anything directly related to asking somehting like this.",2,javascript,2020-10-13

j7qa8s,"[AskJS] Has Cypress ever been using for both ""unit"" and e2e testing?","Whether this has been done before or not, I'm going to try to implement it. I'm just wondering if there is prior art out there to reference. Also, feedback on the idea in general would be appreciated.

**Background**

So, I've done a lot of unit testing with tools like Jest/Enzyme, and I've done e2e testing with Cypress and Selenium. I hate Selenium and love Cypress, btw. Given that I am a strong opponent of snapshot testing with Jest/Enzyme, I find myself writing similar logic in both Jest and Cypress. For example, when I have a presentational component, I'll write Jest logic that tests that the fields render properly for the data I pass in as props. Then, in my Cypress e2e testing, I'll write basically the same thing, but for Cypress.

In addition, I've been embracing the philosophy of integration tests over unit tests, relying on tests that do a more thorough job of testing the application's actual full behavior rather than just narrow pieces of it. Doesn't mean I don't write unit tests anymore, they just tend to be a smaller percentage of my overall test suite.

**My Goal**

I want to write a Cypress test suite that can serve as both ""integration"" style tests and my e2e tests, eliminating nearly all the need to use Jest/Enzyme. Here's a rough overview of how I'm planning to have it work. Keep in mind that a lot of the ideas here are pretty rough and I have not dove too deep into the planning of this project.

**Integration Tests**

1. My React app would need to be mounted somehow, preferably headless so this could run in a CI/CD pipeline.
2. Cypress would run headless (I know it can do that).
3. On initialization, code would run that would mock all API calls, so they wouldn't go anywhere.  

   1. This is the only piece of the app that gets mocked, everything else is the full end-to-end logic.
4. Cypress tests would then ""click"" through the app, relying on the mocked data to handle API responses, validating the UI in the process.

**End to End Tests**

1. Same exact Cypress suite as before, just with some configuration changes.
2. Cypress runs headless against a live version of the app with real (qa) data and real interactions with other services.
3. No APIs are mocked.
4. Cypress tests will properly validate the running application.

**Final Thoughts**

As you can see, the objective is to have one Cypress suite that can both do integration testing against mock data, and actual testing of the live app. I feel these kind of tests will be more robust than Jest/Enzyme unit tests, and since they are re-usable for the e2e tests they have the added benefit of decreasing the overall time spent on testing (unit + e2e tests being written simultaneously). Obviously I would expect some errors to occur when running one way vs another, but it would still be a time saver without sacrificing test coverage.

This is not to say I would expect this to replace all unit tests. There are still plenty of cases where normal unit tests are still essential, such as some fancy TypeScript dynamic type checking logic I wrote recently. However, I really do like the overall direction I'm trying to go in here.

Alright, this wall of text is done. It's late and I'm going to bed. Appreciate both being pointed to prior art that's out there and feedback on the overall idea.",5,javascript,2020-10-13
