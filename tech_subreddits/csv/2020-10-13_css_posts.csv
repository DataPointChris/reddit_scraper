jaemjr,Custom font reskinning icons,"I’m very new to CSS and I’m trying to apply a custom font and style, however the CSS code I’m using is taking all elements and applying the font to them. This means that the font is applied to icons which doesn’t work and instead either returns a square or the text in “content”.

Is there a way to ignore these icons? At the moment the workaround: 

&gt;.qv-object :not(icon) {
&gt;	  font-family: Arial
&gt;}

But if someone changes the object icon to for example icon2, this will cause the issue to reappear. Is there a solution?",1,css,2020-10-13

j9oxkn,Wider Card View in New Reddit?,"The ""card view"", where you click on New Reddit's layout option, and get a few lines of text below each person's post is actually useful, and I like to select it when viewing some Subreddits. It's just that it's too damn narrow. 640px. I get that full-width text becomes hard to read on widescreen monitors, but 640px seems an odd design decision to me, and a search of Reddit posts suggests that I'm not the only one to think that.

I've no idea what I'm doing. I know some Python and C but I don't know CSS or Javascript. I clicked on ""inspect element"" in Firefox, and after discovering how to highlight the relevant layout elements, it seemed that a class called "".\_1OVBBWLtHoSPfGCRaPzpTf.\_3nSp9cdBpqL13CqjdMr2L\_"" has the style ""width: 640px"". So I Googled ""how to change a css class with tampermonkey"", found an example in [a Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19392142), and speculatively using that as a template, I put the following into Tampermonkey:

    // ==UserScript==
    // @name        Reddit Wider Card Layout
    // @match       *://*.reddit.com/*
    // @grant       GM_addStyle
    // @run-at      document-start
    // ==/UserScript==
    
    GM_addStyle ( `
        ._1OVBBWLtHoSPfGCRaPzpTf._3nSp9cdBpqL13CqjdMr2L_ {
    	      width: auto !important;
        }
    ` );

Well incredibly, that just worked immediately for me, and the ""card view"" is now about 850px wide on my 1280-wide monitor rather than 640px.

But I'm wondering why the name of that class was a long stream of random digits. Is that common? It looks like a dynamically-generated random-string. It works at the moment but I'd be surprised if it works tomorrow. Is it just the classname that Reddit serves to me or does anybody else see the same name?

Anyway, like I said, I don't know CSS, and I'm amazed that I've quickly Googled my way into a temporary fix that actually works. Can anybody suggest a more robust way to achieve the same result rather than something that relies on a long random string?",1,css,2020-10-13

j9cfyx,Always have problems positioning elements,"I've coded multiple websites, including the one for my local city hall, but I always have big problems positioning elements. I always manage to do it in the end, but it's by trial and error, not by knowing exactly how it works.

Especially when there's a div inside a div inside a div inside a div, with text,images and so on, at some point I don't know what works anymore, I just try everything: text-align: center, margin: auto, margin:0 auto, positioning with relative/absolute, float,grid,flex and something eventually works.

I know the theory, like margin :auto; = centers block level elements within a container, text-align: center; = centers inline elements, or that in order to use position relative or absolute I need to use position relative on the parent I want to position based on, and so on, but in the chaos that a big website eventually becomes, I get lost.

Sometimes elements don't have the width or height I want them to have, or they lose it, or their paddings and margins act weird, or sections with different vh act weird, or sometimes margin: auto doesn't work, and you get the idea.

    }

However, the Google Assistant STILL picks up a letter at times (maybe 10% of the times): https://i.imgur.com/jPTpFzq.png

j7b8su,How tailwind.css works in the long term? (Maintenance),"Nowadays i don't use any css framework, using BEM and doing my own css with the help of scss seems good enough for me. The thing i love about this is my html markup becomes more readable. That div with 6 classes becomes more clear on what it does when theres a single ""Form\_\_Button--Disabled"", so i don't even have the need to comment anything. 

I have dealed with lot of clients that cant make their minds, one day they want all buttons green but in the next all buttons inside a form should be blue. That's why when i see lot of repetitions like that i just create another class and use extend, and if they ask for another style and just remove the extend or apply other rules. So in my stylesheet this is actually pretty common:

    .button{ ... }
    .form{ 
        &amp;__button{
            @extend .button; 
            Background-color: blue;
        } 
    }

Then, laravel 8 came with tailwind css, at first i found it atrocious, elements having 12 classes, hard coded colors instead of primary or secondary... tried it for a while and it's actually is good for quick prototyping, but how do you maintain things like that? Say, in a project with 20 forms where all buttons are bg-green-100, how do refactor this things without going to those 20 views and searching for that especific button? 

How people handle this things? They create a component for each style or change by props, plus if you are using VUE, what's the benefit of using tailwind inside components instead of scoped style that works without any framework dependency?

Just to be clear, this is not a rant. I don't hate the framework, actually i'm thinking about using it but these questions get in the way everytime i think about it.",22,css,2020-10-13

j776gd,Issue with Firefox and Chrome using position: absolue on &lt;td&gt;,"[https://codepen.io/LosGringo/pen/poboQYg](https://codepen.io/LosGringo/pen/poboQYg)

Hi All, 

I have a problem in the above code where it wont display the same cell positions in firefox and crome. If i add a 1px margin to the yellow cells it fixes the alignmant in crome/edge but knocks it out in firefox. 

Also, setting the column width on a cell doesn't effect anything which i'm not sure why... 

Any help would be much apprciated. 

Thanks

j6tqnu,CSS Grid being placed on/in a block level element - not entire page - What are the limitations?,"*I learned some CSS in the distant past but I am brand new to CSS grid.* Everything I read online seems to imply CSS Grid is for layout of the entire page only. But, can I use it for only part of the layout? What are the limitations on CSS Grid being placed on/in a block level element? (I understand the primary purpose of CSS Grid is page layout and that flexbox may be more appropriate for this.)

For example, if I have a web page with a header and a sidebar html/css already laid out with content - which I cannot edit, can I work with a CSS grid on a div or block level element (below the header and sidebar in the html) with the grid appearing below the header and beside the sidebar on the web page?

Can this be a good or reasonable way to use grid?

...*Grid, like Flexbox, is a value of the CSS display property. Therefore to tell the browser that you want to use grid layout you use display: grid. Having done this, the browser will give you a* ***block-level*** *box on the element* *with display: grid and any direct children will start to participate in a grid formatting context. This means they behave like grid items, rather than normal block and inline elements...*",1,css,2020-10-13

j6pamp,Do you use Bootstrap alongside with css?,"Im trying to learn Bootstrap in order to make my website responsive, normally I do everything with Vanillia CSS.

What I'm trying to understand is, **does bootstrap replace css altogether?** or **you use it alongside css?** If you use it solely, there are some restrictions when it comes to Bootstrap.

1. Colors are very limited in bootstrap, **how can I add a custom color like #394897**, you can only add classes like; **success, danger, warning, e.g.**
2. Bootstrap has classes for margin and padding, but it only gives an option between 0 and 5, **what if I want my margin to be larger than m-5 ?**

If bootstrap **doesn't replace** css altogether, how can I use it in a way that, I can do my **stylings in css** and do only **responsive layout in bootstrap?**

**In summary:** When you use Bootstrap, do you **solely** use it, or you use it for layouts, and **still use css** for margin, padding, styling et cetera...

I am following along with [this tutorial on parsing websites with requests-html.](https://youtu.be/5u391bX9FVE?t=1049)

**Goal:** My goal is to learn more by applying his code on a more difficult website (stackoverflow, for example.) I successfully isolated the 'div' tag/class using the code below. I now intend to sort everything on stackoverflow's recent questions page that is labeled div to find the 'question-summary' and somehow isolate the question ID.

* I want to isolate the question ID, save the associated html page for that unique question, and read each html page for each question that are in the first 3 pages (150 questions) of the most recent questions posted.

**Problem:** At the 17:29 in the video, he points out that the tag/class he using a selector on was only used once and he would ""need to go back to the drawing board"" if it was used more than once.

I am trying to search for something relating to either 'id' or question-summary-#' . I am not sure what I am searching for but I know that there will be more than one. **What is the next step**?

**Example result of current code:**

    &lt;Element 'div' class=('question-summary',) id='question-summary-64050283'&gt;,

Hello everyone!  


So I have been working on this project for a while now,.. let me show you how it works. 

&amp;#x200B;

The code is unlimited until the launch is over and is applied to:

  \- Full Kit. 

\- Bulma Templates.

 \- Tailwind Templates. 

\- All templates individually.  

If you wonder what does WT offers, is very easy...

  So.., Wicked Templates offer, well.... templates without style, so you can style them as you want to, you get the layout, like a wireframe, but with HTML. 

The Templates are only made with HTML, and instead of downloading Tailwind or Bulma, they only have 1 file HTML because they are using the CDN of the CSS Framework.  

 You can buy them single or in packages.  There's a couple of them for free so you get a grasp of what you are buying.

j540ar,CSS Grid : How Auto placement algorithm works,"I was going through the example provided in MDN [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow) on **grid-auto-flow** to understand how the auto-placement algorithm works in CSS grid. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I understand from this another [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Auto-placement_in_CSS_Grid_Layout) from MDN, CSS grid places items in this order:

 1. **Explicit placement**: First place all the positioned items (items1 and 4)

 2. **Implicit or Auto-placement**: Place all the other items in their **order** value (if any) defined in Grid. If no order defined, place them in order in which they appear in document source.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have 2 major doubts regarding how it works in above example:

 1. If we are placing positioned items first, then in case of option set to **row**, why isn't explicitly placed item 4 (red) placed in the first row and 2nd column? Why does implicitly placed Blue get placed before it in second column? Also, this behavior is seemingly correct when option set to **column**

 2. Why is auto-placement working differently in case of **row** and **column** values. In case of option **column** we start by filling columns, so why can't the first auto-placed item (item2 yellow) occupy the empty cell at row1, column1 position (like it does in case of option: **row**)

&amp;#x200B;

PS: If required, here's a [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/usqvjL8k/) for the example (you can change the select **option** to change value of **grid-auto-flow** property here).",2,css,2020-10-13

I wanted to quickly redesign Netflix's by creating **a light version** with a more rounded/smooth style but without changing the familiar page structure.

**Process**

Instead of wasting time recreating the whole design from scratch in Adobe XD and then making the necessary changes I just redesigned it in the browser **with only 97 lines of CSS**. ( literally took me 2 minutes using intab.io extension )

just some basic CSS, nothing special just had to use a few !important to override some existing CSS rules and that's pretty much it.

Works great—as long as the link is only on one line. If I resize the window so the link is on more than one line (or just make a really long link) then it no longer works. Can anyone tell me why?

To clarify: I don't entirely understand the code in the first place. I copied the animation bit from the web. Therefore, I really don't understand why it isn't working.

I'll paste it in next, but I also created a codepen with it. Resize the window so the link is only on one line and you will see it works, but resize the window so the link is over two lines and you will see it no longer works. [Here is the codepen](https://codepen.io/dbooster/pen/xxVvLZM). 

If you can fix it, I really appreciate your help. If you can explain it so that I understand exactly what is going on, even better. Thank you for any ideas or help!

so my text and links are currently blue and bg is white, when i hover on a link i want all the text to turn white and the bg blue.

so far im not able to do this with just css and i have no knowledge of java, what i do results in the bg changing blue and swallowing up all the text except for the link hovered.

j2gdvx,Maintaining Vertical Rhythm with grid-row-gap and a SASS mixin.,"So I am sure as most experienced devs on here can attest, creating and maintaining a consistent vertical rhythm on the web is tricky.

I've personally been having issues with it at work. However, we recently dropped IE11 support, so I have a little more freedom to explore **CSS Grid** and other ""newer"" specs to use across our web properties.

Today I decided to experiment with `grid-row-gap` and I think I've come up with a pretty basic Sass mixin that can be applied to a child of a grid element that will account for a text elements `line-height` property.

Admittedly I am not a math ""wiz"", and new to grid, so I'd like to open it up to all here to let me know how you would improve this, and what are the potential pitfalls.

You can see it in action here: [https://codepen.io/SavSamoylov/pen/eYZaBjW](https://codepen.io/SavSamoylov/pen/eYZaBjW)

I’m currently running Firefox Developer Edition 82. When opening “inspect element”, I noticed an option that says “—darkreader-inline-bgcolor:#a60036”. When I disabled this in the browser, all the colors looked as intended.

How would I disable this from the HTML or CSS file, or even the JS file? Since the project relies on the accuracy of the colors, this option being enabled is not ideal.

I know about Object-Fit and Cover, but I cannot seem to get my rectangular image to fit into a perfect circle. So far, from the things I've tried, it either ends up making my image an oval, or fits only half of the image into the circle, making a weird hemisphere of an image.

As for my second question, I've created a blog post listing widget (it shows up in the blog's list page with some preview text about the post, how long it takes to read, its tags, etc.) that I've put into a Bootstrap card. I've gotten the widget's card to fit inside of a rectangle, but it never shows portions of the image that I want.

Quick background:

One-page site, making a section that will have images and text.  Images on left, text on right.

I have created a grid and gotten my images to stack on the left, with text on the right.  That's already a win, because I was struggling with this before, and got this to work by changing my display to grid.

Current problem:

I want to have captions under each image.  I am not sure how to add this properly now.  I have the grid set up as two columns and three rows with auto sizing.  There will be three images.  Text will fit on left. 

Should I / can I create an edited grid where I create six rows, three taller ones for images, and three shorter ones for text to add captions?  Is this going to fuck up the text flowing through on the right side (I need the text to go from top to bottom, as though there is only one row in the right column).  

I am pretty new to playing with grids and flexbox.  Maybe there is a flexbox solution I should be considering.  Anyway, any help is greatly appreciated.

I know that place-items is short for align-items and justify-items. For me, I've found that this doesn't always center a flex container that contains multiple block elements. It apparently has something to do with rows versus fluid containers. For example, a div with 2 child divs, would only be centered along the cross-axis with that CSS.

I've found that for me only **align-items: center**; and **justify-content: center**; used together on a **display: flex** container actually centers. 

I also don't think this works on inline elements though, since they don't have height.

Is there a shorthand, one line command for **align-items: center** and **justify-content: center**? I know there is place-content and place-items but neither has both of those two together. 

I could also be wrong and it does center, I could be doing the CSS/HTML wrong. Could someone help me understand why this is the case?",5,css,2020-10-13

So it looks like its part of the footer, but as soon as the screen size is changed the image location relative to the footer changes. it also means the image only shows on one page, not site wide. This is because (I will repeat) its not actually part of the footer, its simply an image block sitting on top of the footer.  
Where I am stuck is making the image part of the footer, and setting its location and size to be relative to the blue rectangle of the footer, so that when another screen size is used, the logo expands and shrinks with the footer, and it always maintains the same level of overhang above and below the blue rectangle.

I need to figure out the code to:

1. Make the image part of the footer
2. Keep it in the foreground
3. Have it resize relative to the footer
4. Ensure that the image size remains proportional to blue rectangle so the the overhang visible in the image remains consistent on various screen sizes

In other words, I have div which can be any height, and I’d like to make the parent container twice its height. I’ve tried all sort of things around padding, margin and positioning, but every value seems to depend on the parent’s size and not the child’s.

I saw few weeks ago somewhere on the Internet, quite a big place, someone talking about a stylesheet they were using as a basic CSS style. It's not really a framework, it's like...

Does anyone have something like that?

Thanks to this sub, I have made an interface for my game that scales quite well with the different window sizes. See here: [https://jsfiddle.net/076Lyrcs/4/](https://jsfiddle.net/076Lyrcs/4/) 

I would like the game to be more dynamic and would like to animate the cards. (Cards picked up from the deck move to the hand; cards selected by the player in their hand move to the playing field; cards from the playing field move to the discard pile; etc...)

I'm not sure how to animate this, or even if it is possible.

Could you point me to some resources to learn how to animate such movements? It does not need to be pixel-perfect movement, but add a sense of movement so that the player better understand cards moving around.

iwjgro,Modifying ngbTooltip,"Hello I am fairly new to learning more about modifying the look of the elements on my components and I try to create a flexible ellipsis tooltip, which expands as the text within the tooltip expands.

I am using ng-bootstrap elements

  
To clarify:  
I have a textarea which, if you are in view mode, you are supposed to hover over it and it should display the tooltip containing the entire text from the textarea.  
The textarea can fit 15char before the threshold to 'creating' the tooltip is reached and the entire text will be out into the tooltip, while the textarea stays at a constant width of 15char and cuts off.  


I cannot, for the frustration of me, find where to access the .tooltip attributes and I cannot edit the global.scss because other tooltips are already applied throughout my application and I would like to specify the overflow/ellipsis behaviour only for this specific tooltip.  


I applied the tooltip as such:

&lt;span ngbtooltip=""mytooltip""&gt;  
   &lt;input type=""text"" formControlName=""..."" ...  
&lt;/span&gt;

If someone could explain to me, how I can access the tooltip in my span element in my component.scss - or which information I failed to provide to you, I would be very grateful",2,css,2020-10-13

I am using a data-featherlight iframe (on Squarespace) to pop out some content, specifically blogs, with the following code:

    &lt;a href=""URL"" data-featherlight=""iframe"" data-featherlight-iframe-style=""display:block;border:none;height:90vh;width:85vw;""&gt;VISIBLE TEXT&lt;/a&gt;

Works fine.

However, those pop-out pages I do not want the header/footer appearing, so I have had to inject the following on that section of the site for all blogs:

    &lt;style&gt;#header, #mobile.bar, #footer, #footer-sections {display: none !important;}&lt;/style&gt;

Again, this works. But the issue is this section is unusable outside of the iframe as it strips the header/footer out,  making it unable to navigate the site.

I want these pages to be able to live on the site (with header/footer intact) and only remove the header/footer out when I call it via iframe.

Am I missing a variable inline in the iframe styling to do so? I couldn't find documentation to the fact. Or should I be using javascript to be stripping out the header/footer only on condition that it's within an iframe? If so, I've found a few ways to determine if the window is an iframe, but I can't figure out how to remove the header/footer thereafter since my JS is very rudimentary.

Ideally I would eventually need to control at least 10 of these assets on the field, along with the hand of the player. How would I go about making sure that the scaling doesn't mess up? Also, how do I scale the entire element size? So that if I want the entire card and it's child elements to scale uniformly without messing up the styling.

    p{

Before doing anything to the padding, the background color red extended to the right across the entire screen. When I change the padding to 30px, you can see the top, left, and bottom change but the right padding is still extending across the entire screen. I did not change the padding in the p selector so you can see what the padding looks like by default (even though it had the same problem when I tried to change the padding). I also tried using ""padding-right"" and it didn't work. Here is a screenshot:

When I first load the webpage initially, all of my styles are correct, but when I switch between landscape and portrait, this extra white space is added. Once again, I’ve only experienced this in Chrome on IOS. Tested on Android and everything is fine. 

Some solutions I’ve tried have been dealing with padding env, overflow hidden, and meta tags, all of which have not helped. 

I’m using Nextjs for Static Site Generation so I’m sure it’s got to be a CSS issue on my end, but I just can’t seem to find the issue! Actually, when I did receive an error, the Nextjs Error was rendered to the webpage with the extra white space on the right as well. 

Sorry for the longish post, but any insight would help immensely.

itdaof,"Feedback Please: Mistakes People Make while Learning CSS (Basics of Cascades, User Agent Style Sheet, JSFiddle, etc.)","I am an experienced dev who just spent the last months learning CSS. I made a lot of procedural mistakes while learning (like not accounting for User Agent Style Sheets, cascading styles changing my styles, containers negating my styles, etc.) I wrote up some tips and tricks for how beginners can approach CSS without hitting these learning gotchas. This is NOT an article about CSS, but more about things that can interfere with your learning. I'm no expert at CSS though, so I was hoping you guys, who have more experience with CSS, could give some feedback. Thanks in advance! Here's the article:

&amp;#x200B;

When people learn CSS they often focus on Selectors and Styles. They are important but don’t spend too much time on them! Know they exist, know what they do, bookmark your [favorite reference site](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) then move on to understanding CSS as a system.

A key part of the CSS system is that Selectors and Styles cascade. Cascading means that Selectors can select the same element and merge or overwrite Styles. So your style sheet might overwrite someone else’s styling… and someone else (maybe even yourself!) might overwrite your styling.

Where do these other Styles come from? For starters, your web browser provides a default style sheet called the User Agent Style Sheet. This default style sheet is different for every browser. For example, if you write this style block:

`button { fill:red; }`

Then look at the styling in the browser, you will see something like this:

`button {fill: red;appearance: button;-webkit-writing-mode: horizontal-tb !important;text-rendering: auto;color: -internal-light-dark(buttontext, rgb(170, 170, 170));letter-spacing: normal;word-spacing: normal;text-transform: none;text-indent: 0px;text-shadow: none;display: inline-block;text-align: center;align-items: flex-start;cursor: default;background-color: -internal-light-dark(rgb(239, 239, 239), rgb(74, 74, 74));box-sizing: border-box;margin: 0em;font: 400 13.3333px Arial;padding: 1px 6px;border-width: 2px;border-style: outset;border-color: -internal-light-dark(rgb(118, 118, 118), rgb(195, 195, 195));border-image: initial;}`

All that extra styling comes from the browser’s User Agent Style Sheet. The User Agent Style Sheet can make it tricky to tell what your CSS is doing versus what the User Agent Style Sheet is doing. One way around this, especially while learning, is to cancel out the User Agent Style Sheet by using a CSS Reset. A reset is CSS that sets most of the styles to known default values that do as little as possible. There are many CSS Resets. A common one is [Eric Meyer’s CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). Just include the reset before your CSS.

The cascade looks like this: User Agent CSS -&gt; CSS Reset -&gt; Your CSS.

Note, a Reset may not overwrite all User Agent CSS styles so you may still have some random styles sneaking into your CSS. For example, Eric Meyer’s Reset doesn’t reset button styling.

Next is to understand that your own CSS (or someone else’s CSS that you include) may inadvertently modify your CSS without you knowing it or meaning to. An obvious example of this is specifying a style using a selector that modifies all elements of a type. All elements will get that style!

Because of this, most people prefer to write Selectors using classes rather than element types. Classes tend to be flexible, you can create infinite numbers of them, and a single element can have multiple classes.

Multiple classes let you mix and match your styles. For example, you can have a classes called button, dark and light. This lets you specify a dark button and a light button without writing the same styles over and over.

`&lt;button class=""button light""&gt;&lt;/button&lt;button class=""button dark""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;`

Another way to prevent your CSS from accidentally “infecting” elements you didn’t mean to modify is to use more complex, specific selectors that limit your CSS to very specific elements.

As well as cascading Styles, Styles on a container of your element might also affect your element’s Style. Because Styles can interact badly with other Styles for so many reasons, the best way to test your CSS is to use \[JSFiddle\]([https://jsfiddle.net/](https://jsfiddle.net/)) or \[CodePen\]([https://codepen.io/](https://codepen.io/)) with just the styles and bare minimum elements you want to test or understand. This guarantees your sample CSS is “clean and working”. When you integrate it back into your main project and it doesn’t work, you can assume it’s a bad interaction rather than bad CSS. Make sure your CSS isn't being overwritten, interacting badly with other styles, or that your containers aren't overriding their children's behavior.

Browsers like Chrome and Firefox can show you the styles that are being applied to your elements, let you edit them, and help you track down where the styles are coming from. Never believe that only your CSS is styling an element; always double check in your browser. [How to see CSS on an element in Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css). [How to do it in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_and_edit_CSS).

Finally, there is a lot of complexity how Styles work. It’s not worth it to memorize, understand, or even recognize every style until you need them. However, it is a good idea to get a rough understanding of shared principles of most styles, as this understanding mostly applies to every style. Check out this article on [CSS margin, padding, content, and border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model). **Skim** [this style explanation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block), mainly to see how insanely complicated Styles can get. Then get a feel for standard flow, Box, FlexBox and Grid. But you don’t need to understand them deeply until you need them.

Cascading Style Sheets can be very powerful but also very frustrating. Make sure your styles aren’t being overwritten or interacting badly by using CSS Resets and isolating your CSS in JSFiddles. Know that Selectors and Styles can be super complex! Don’t bother trying to learn them all, just know they exist, know what they generally do, and study them when you need them.

isxhyj,How do I blur incoming and outgoing text/elements when scrolling?,"Edit: I have found what I was looking for. To anyone who wants to achieve the same thing, search for ""gradient transparency masking"". This may help you get started (add it as a property to whatever you want):

    -webkit-mask-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left 90%, left bottom, from(rgba(0,0,0,1)), to(rgba(0,0,0,0)))

Edit 2: This is the final code that I have put on my website, which gives you fading in at the bottom and fading out at the top:

`-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0%, rgba(0,0,0,0)), color-stop(5%, rgba(1,1,1,1)), color-stop(95%, rgba(1,1,1,1)), color-stop(100%, rgba(0,0,0,0)));`

`mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom,rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) 0%,rgba(0, 0, 0, 1) 5%,rgb(0, 0, 0, 1) 95%,rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) 100%);`

I would like to achieve the effect mentioned [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22666063/how-to-fade-the-edge-of-a-div-with-just-css).

When I had a solid background, I could achieve it fine. However, now I am using a changing background with a gradient and I can no longer use anything that relies on a fixed gradient or colours.

I want to blur the incoming and outgoing content into the background when I scroll, rather than having it disappear abruptly (the div that is scrollable is within the page, it is not the entire page.

I am making a simple card, where an array creates the number of squares. The objective is that the squares fit the div, no matter the number. Ex: if in the div there are only 2 squares, the size of the squares is bigger to fit the div. If the div have like 5 squares, they should resize to fit inside de div, and so go on. 

I spent hours and hours trying to create that i and couldnt. 

I have the code in thje editor if anyone want to see it: 

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-kdapqa?file=src/app/app.component.css](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-kdapqa?file=src/app/app.component.css)

When the order array, have like only 1 object, the square should fit the div squares. If the order have two objects. The two squares must be 50% of the div and so go on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know if i am expalining this right or not, but the squares should be responsive to the div",3,css,2020-10-13

**&lt;table style=""width: 100%; height: 100%;""&gt;**

**&lt;tbody&gt;**

So at the moment, I've generated a 50% 2px solid black line about 25px above and 25px below each H2 using a :before and :after. It definitely does the trick and doesn't look too awful.

But does anyone else have some examples or other ideas of distinguishing the H2 without changing its color? I'm just kind of looking for design suggestions. It could be another way to play the borders or what not. I'm open to anything.

Edit: I spent some time with different designs, testing out what looked good. I ended up just boosting each H size, maintaining a 1.33 ratio, and adding a full width 1px solid black underline for just the H2. I am really impressed with out it turned out.

I am working on some apps, and i left the css/layout part to the end because i hate it! I know the basics, but when i apply them, it doesnt work with logic like the other parts of making an app/website. 

For exemple, i have this div and one button ,and i want to make a button to be at the bottom of the div. I tried everything that i searchged and study and the button dont want to move! 

Html:

 `&lt;ion-col &gt;`  
`&lt;div id=""secondCol""&gt;`  
`&lt;ion-text&gt; {{card.cardPoints}} = {{card.cardValue}} € &lt;/ion-text&gt;`  
`&lt;!--          &lt;ion-text&gt;{{userPercentageCards[i]}} %&lt;/ion-text&gt;--&gt;`  
 `&lt;ion-button id=""useButton"" *ngIf=""userPercentageCards[i] &gt;=100""&gt; Usar Cartão!&lt;/ion-button&gt;`  
`&lt;/div&gt;`  
`&lt;/ion-col&gt;`

css:

`#secondCol{`  
 `position: absolute;`  
 `width: 100%;`  
 `height: 100%;`  
`}`  


`#useButton{`  
 `position: relative;`  
 `bottom: 0;`  
 `}`

The button stays bellow the text and not at the bottom.

For exemple i have one div and one image that is centered. When i apply the width of the image like 50%, the logic is that the image will stay centered but the width of 50% of the div. But what happens? the image stays close to the right and not centered!

icm3i5,Media queries inside style rules - what is best practice,"I've just started working with a developer who embeds his media queries right inside his style rules like this:

    	main {
    		padding:40px 20px;
                    
    		@media only screen and (min-width:760px) {
    			padding: 200px;
    		}
    	}

whereas I've always had separate rules under different breakpoints ie:

    main {
    padding:40px 20px;
    }
    
    @media only screen and (min-width:760px) {
        main {
            padding:40px 20px;
        }

Does anyone know if there any disadvantages to the first method - I've not seen it before and it seems like quite a good way to organise things?

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#four""&gt;&lt;span class=""toc-section-number""&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; Four&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#four.two""&gt;&lt;span class=""toc-section-number""&gt;4.2&lt;/span&gt; Four.Two&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#four.two.one""&gt;&lt;span class=""toc-section-number""&gt;4.2.1&lt;/span&gt; Four.Two.One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    .toc {
        float:left;
        margin: 0 45px 0 0;
        font-size:85%;
        font-family: ""Noto Sans"";
    }
    
    .toc .toc-section-number {
        width:20px;
        display:inline-block;
        margin-right:0px;
        text-align:left;
    }
    
    .toc ul {
        list-style:none;
        margin-bottom:0;
    }
    
    .toc&gt;ul {
        margin:0;
        padding:0;
    }
    
    .toc&gt;ul&gt;li&gt;ul&gt;li {
        width:25px;
    }
    
    .toc&gt;ul&gt;li&gt;ul&gt;li&gt;ul&gt;li {
        width:30px;
    }

Which works as expected - but the 'wonkiness' of the text text on the left and the mismatching in the gaps between numbers and entry bothers me (I would not mind it if it got smaller each time if this was in some way proportional and if it did not affect the alignment of the entries such that the leftermost text of the entry below comes beneath the capital letter of the former item.) Is there anyway I can make this neater, even if just a little?

ic81nq,What would be the best approach to create this?,"https://imgur.com/a/sZQAql1

I'm quite new to css and I'm wondering what would be the best approach to create this, in order to be able to animate the 'diagonal line' later. (And display it correctly on other browsers.)


Some notes:

- The diagonal line has a height of 85% and equal width, to maintain a 45 degree angle regardless of the screen width. If the screen is wider there will be more image on the left side and more white space on the right side.

- Later I would like to animate the line, when the line shifts to the top left corner, the full text will be revealed and the image will be cropped.


Some questions: 

1. Is it better to put an image shape on top of the text? Or put a white shape on top of the image and hide the overflow?

2. How to create the shape? Clip path, rotated square, ..?

3. How to keep the image centered/stretched nicely when the screen ratio changes?

Which works fine - I need to use webfonts because they are large and I need extensive unicode support - but, given that I already have the fonts locally (and I imagine many people will have the noto fonts locally), ideally, I would have the site pick up on that and use the local font, instead of stalling and loading the fonts from Google.

My main browser is Firefox and I just finished building a website and decided to check out how it looks in other browsers. I open up chrome and check out responsive mode. And its insanely buggy, when I resize the screen I keep getting different results and it often takes a while to load in?? (it sometimes randomly scales after a second or two). Its so weird, in firefox its snappy and responsive.So I'm wondering if that's normal or if my chrome is just somehow messed up or if my queries are just whack??Anyway, here is a pic of what I mean [https://i.imgur.com/k5Qb6NZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/k5Qb6NZ.png) see how in chrome it doesn't cover the full width, but in ff it does? But if I play with it and keep resizing it up and down, it eventually covers the full width how its supposed to.

My queries are all like this \` \\@media only screen *and* (max-width: 1130px)\`, only using max-width.

Also while I'm here, can I somehow make the text look the same on both chrome and firefox? My text looks worse in chrome and I don't like it [https://i.imgur.com/rzj7A6G.png](https://i.imgur.com/rzj7A6G.png)I read that its because of the rendering engines they use, but I'm hoping there is some way to reduce the difference.

PS. IN BOTH PICS CHROME IS ON THE LEFT FF RIGHT

PSS. THANKS FOR READING

SMALL UPDATEWell I returned to the tab after like 10-20 minutes and it worked fine?? After that I closed chrome and opened it again, it was going crazy again..I have a lot of media queries and it seems like not all of them update at the same time, but instead some do, some don't

iaaxxy,Question: How do I create a responsive box that partially extends outside of a section?,"I'm having some trouble creating a box that partially extends outside of its section while also staying responsive. I've experimented with several methods and upon my latest attempt I got the height of the section to automatically extend with the box but still can't manage to get it centered and have a portion of the box extend out over the section.

i9k65a,"Need Grid help please! Just want row height to collapse. I'm doing something dumb, I know it..","Hi all  - I'm not up on my grid like I am on flex... I'm trying a simple 4-square grid where the elements are grouped as such:

    .parent {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
      grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
      grid-column-gap: 0px;

    .div2 { grid-area: 1 / 2 / 2 / 4; }
    .div3 { grid-area: 2 / 2 / 3 / 4; }

So we have 1 left column that spans 2 rows and on the right are 2 rows of 1 grid item each. The widths are constrained (350px first column, the right is auto) but the heights are the issue. Imagine one long list on the left, some meters on the top right and the bottom right hosts a table. 

Basically, the grid-row-heights are equally proportioned, and I need it to expand or contract with the content.

If the left list or bottom right table results are very long, the row's individual height can grow, and the grid adds it to both halves. 

Edit: I've also tried this: **grid-template-rows: auto auto;** with nearly the same results.

I've been working on an issue for a couple of days now that's driving me crazy, so I'm now humbly requesting assistance from the community to see if any of you CSS wizards might have any suggestions.

I have a simple mockup of the issue in this codepen: [https://codepen.io/cdt87/pen/eYZJpQy](https://codepen.io/cdt87/pen/eYZJpQy)

If you're looking at the codepen, the issue is with the content on the right (in the grey container).  The content on the left isn't important.  On desktop with a large viewport, the longer text on the right wraps to the next line even though there seems to be plenty of room for it to expand so it could all fit on one line.

This is what I'm trying to accomplish -- preventing the text from wrapping to the next line if there is still room in the parent container.  However, this text is variable, so if it is too long to fit in the parent container, I would still like the text to wrap to a new line, but ONLY if there is no room in the parent container.  And also, I am hoping this can be done while keeping the grey container's column widths at 50% so that both sides end up being the same width with the text centered.

I also have a media query in place. Above 960px, the grey container should wrap to the next line and the text should still not wrap to a new line if there is room in the container.

When the screen gets to about mobile phone size, the links in the navbar condense into a ""burger"" icon that, when clicked, causes a dropdown animation to extend from the right side of the screen, containing all of the aforementioned links. More of a ""sidemenu"" than a ""dropdown"" i suppose.

Problem is, when the dropdown is activated, this causes many issues with what is being presented on the main page, such as the dropdown refusing to extend if there is text written in the spot where it extends, and in the case of icons, extending past the icons, and either obscuring them, or leaving them right where they were, making things look broken and ugly.

At the moment, I'm using a hidden `span` element with higher `z-index`, absolute positioning, and boldface to achieve this effect. Something like this: 

    &lt;p&gt;You know I &lt;span class=""writeover""&gt;hate&lt;/span&gt;love you.&lt;/p&gt;

This works ""well"", except when the word ""love"" is pushed to the start of a new line of text. In that case, ""hate"" will not be printed over it, but right at the end of the previous line, ruining the effect.

i4drwa,Button breaking out of parent. I can fix it with word-break but I don't know the correct solution.,"I've got a weird problem that I was able to jankily fix with word-break, but I don't understand the root cause or correct solution. The markup is approximately as follows:

    &lt;div id=""right""&gt;
        &lt;span class=""confirm_holder_stage2""&gt;
            &lt;input placeholder=""Album title""&gt;
            &lt;button&gt;Create child&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;button&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

-

    #right
    {
        padding: 8px;
    }
    #right .confirm_holder_stage2
    {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
    }
    #right .confirm_holder_stage2 input
    {
        flex: 1;
        min-width: 0;
    }

The idea is that the two buttons should use their natural width, and the input should flex-grow to fill the rest of the row space. In total, this row should always occupy the full width of the parent.

The problem is that if the text within the buttons is long, they wind up busting out of the parent div when instead the input should be shrinking to compensate, since it has a min width of 0. The problem is most pronounced if the button text does not contain spaces, and less pronounced/eliminated if the text does contain spaces.

Here's a video demonstration: https://voussoir-s3-public.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/2020-08-05_13-28-07.mp4

And you can visit it here: https://etiquette.voussoir.net/album/000000000002

I can solve it by setting `word-break: break-all` on the buttons. My attempts at fixing it with `flex` parameters didn't work. To me, it looks like the browser is judging how much space the button needs based on how the text would wrap, even though the text never actually needs to wrap. This also occurs on Firefox.

Why is my attempt at this incorrect, and what's the right way of doing it?

I am hoping someone in this community can help me out. I am an amateur (please be kind), and trying to revise something on a website that was set up for me by someone who I am no longer in touch with.

I am trying to use the style.css of my site to make an SVG to change color when it's hovered over by the mouse. 

The site currently does this with .png files by having the .png file contain both the original and the hover image, and switching the viewable position of the .png when the mouse is over it.

In trying to replace my .png with .svg, however, this doesn't seem to work as well. It appears that the closest solution to doing things this way would be to use viewbox, but from my research, viewbox only works in html, not css. Is this accurate? (Again, I'd like to keep everything within the style.css if at all possible)

You can see what I'm talking about on the site itself:

[https://www.mysteryboxshow.com/](https://www.mysteryboxshow.com/)

In the upper-right hand corner are social media buttons set up with the .png method I mentioned. (I haven't gotten around to changing those to svg yet)

But the ""Livestream"" button directly to the left of them is the .svg I would like to use the viewbox on, to change between the dark grey/maroon color. (Also from what I've read, it's easier to change a single-color svg, so perhaps I'm making more trouble for myself by using an image with several colors?)

Basically, on my 15"" mbp, the page sometimes loads with all content in a single column that bleeds over into a second column. Instead of evenly distributed in 3 columns. 

Resizing the window just a little bit, causes the content to distribute correctly. 

I can't figure out what the issue is, and because I'm not all that good at CSS and WP, I'm having a hard time isolating what the potential cause of conflict is. 

[Here's a video](https://www.loom.com/share/732abf791d75417f90816a86e12a0a97) showing what I mean (it's inconsistent, sometimes it loads fine and I can't figure out why) 

Here is the site where you can see the page live and view whatever is happening in the console. 

https://361acupuncture.com/what-to-tell-your-acupuncturist/

The main issue is that it's not happening like this consistently. For some reason, as I'm writing this post now, it's back to behaving as expected. 

I imagine this is probably due to some network error where some of my css isn't loading properly. But how do I figure out if that's actually the issue and what I can do to make sure it doesn't happen?

I'm loading all of my css through the theme 'custom css' option within 'appearances' in wordpress.

If it is an issue with loading of stylesheets, would it change anything if I somehow edited the theme php files to load the stylesheet directly?

​

I am quite new to web development and i am experiencing some troubles with CSS grid. I searched a lot on google and youtube but i didn't found an answer to my question. my question is:

when you are using CSS grid on a website, do you need to make one grid for the whole site? for example you make a class

.grid{

display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;

}

for you website, do you need to stick to this or can you make an other grid for example

.navbar{

display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr ;
grid-template-rows: 1fr; (just an example)

}

because when i try do make my design, it only works when i use different grids but i am not sure if that is the correct way to use it. I hope you understand my question and can help me out.

i0ajyj,Flexbox: Is it possible to stretch an element horizontally *only* if its content cannot fit the available height?,"[Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/suz3qnd0/).

I suspect the answer to this is ""no"", but I've been screwing with this for ages and I'm hoping someone has a creative solution.

I've got a column of text, occupying 30% of the width of a display:flex container with a fixed height.  What I'm trying to achieve is the content div keeping that 30% width *unless* the text cannot fit the height of the element, in which case I want the content div to get wider.

You can see the situation in that fiddle by removing the display:none on the second &lt;p&gt;.  Doing that causes the text to overflow the bottom of the container; what I want is for #content to stretch horizontally *just* far enough to prevent that overflow from happening.  In this example, it should stretch to about 35% width and then stop.

Does anyone have any thoughts on an implementation that would achieve this?",2,css,2020-10-13

I have tried using ../ at the start to back out of the HTML folder as some form posts said to do, but it did nothing for me. this is not hosted anywhere as I am just messing around for now. But when I have both the HTML and CSS in the root folder then doing just ""imageformat.css"" works just fine for linking. however, having them seperated by any amount of folders breaks everything.

hul7l1,How to fix footer's top margin in a flexbox,"Hello, I'm having trouble with [this](https://jsfiddle.net/6pgy80vL/) simple design and I was wondering if anyone could help me.

I have to make it so the `min-height` is at least as high as the viewport and change the `footer`'s `margin-top` to be `auto` in order for it to be always at the bottom.

But in doing so, the margin between `footer` and `main` ends up becoming half of what it is supposed to be in case the content of `main` is too big. I realize that I could simple add a `margin-bottom: .6rem` rule for `main`, but the trouble is in my actual project there's no guarantee that `main` will be the element before the `footer`.

Is there any smarter approach to this problem? I think many of you probably already encountered a similar situation in the past.

- I need only styling like colors, fonts and stuff. Layout and spaceing I will do myself
- I just need css properties so I can name the classes what i want. That's why avoid bootstrap and other frameworks.

hruwrr,Calling same keyframe animation from two different class definitions,"Hi! I am doing a small react project and trying to do animations with css. When i hover over an image with the mouse I want it to go opaque and when I de-hover I want it to go back. I have an animation that takes the opacity from 1 to 0.4. I then want to re-use this animation with the animationDirection: reverse but it does not work. This is my code:

I am using material UI JSS ([https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/))

`mediaHide: {`  
 `animationName: ""$fadeOut"",`  
 `animationDuration: ""0.6s"",`  
 `opacity: '0.4',`  
  `},`  
 `mediaShow: {`  
 `animationName: '$fadeOut',`  
 `animationDirection: 'reverse',`  
 `animationDuration: '0.4s',`  
 `opacity: '1'`  
  `},`  
 `'@keyframes fadeOut': {`  
 `from: {opacity: 1},`  
 `to: {opacity: 0.4},`  
  `},`

&amp;#x200B;

This does not work. But when calling different keyframe animations it works, like this:

&amp;#x200B;

`mediaHide: {`  
 `animationName: ""$fadeOut"",`  
 `animationDuration: ""0.6s"",`  
 `opacity: '0.4',`  
  `},`  
 `mediaShow: {`

 `opacity: '1'`  
  `},`  
 `'@keyframes fadeOut': {`  
 `from: {opacity: 1},`  
 `to: {opacity: 0.4},`  
  `},`  
 `'@keyframes fadeIn': {`  
 `from: {opacity: 0.4},`  
 `to: {opacity: 1},`  
  `},`

I trigger the animation with 

`&lt;Card`   
 `className={classes.background}`  
 `onMouseEnter={()=&gt;setCardState(true)}`  
 `onMouseLeave={()=&gt;setCardState(false)}&gt;`

and change the css class on the image with:

hreqy8,Random splash screen with CSS only,"So I'm part of a site that let's you customize using css and basic html. Someone introduced how to do splash screens and I had a thought about trying to do a random splash every time the home page is loaded. However, everything I've read says that you have to run javascript or some other process that the site isn't engineered to allow. I'd still consider myself a novice, but far enough along to get general ideas and identify how to play with them. So I was trying to do some lateral thinking, and was hoping it might either pan out, or that someone more talented than myself might be able to tell me if I'm just throwing too much spaghetti at the wall. 

What if instead of trying to run a process with javascript, you already have the elements that you want to target as part of the page. So instead of a CSS line making &lt;div class=""splashlogo""&gt; do something,

*Splashlogo is:*     div.splashlogo:before {content:url(https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/244268/assets/1093491/MINDFLAYER_RING_-_FRONT_1200x1200_1__8_.png?1593977945);}

can you instead use CSS to make random pictures or objects act a certain way? Like, hide some pictures on the page either by turning down the opacity or changing z-elements, then use CSS to make random ones become the focus each time? 

Sorry if this is better asked somewhere else. New to the programming community and just trying to get some direction. Thanks!

hr1j7t,"Need help: Set width for ::after of flex element, for text/element underline","[Working demonstration code](https://jsfiddle.net/0uo3fe5L/) 
#Problem

I have a [horizontal `&lt;nav&gt;` menu with plain links](https://i.imgur.com/JyZDUGF.png), it is `display: flex;` and `flex-direction: row;` and it wraps in small screen widths:

* [mid wrap](https://i.imgur.com/0Ou77mK.png)
* [more wrap](https://i.imgur.com/3QEKNwR.png)
* [fully wrapped](https://i.imgur.com/Dr5slWe.png)

As you can see I wanted to add visual dividers for the links, since two of them have more than one word, and if they wrap it might be difficult to distinguish which is which. It is basically `&lt;a&gt;` text underline but for the entire element.

#My attempt
I added `::after` for each `&lt;a&gt;` element, with `border-bottom` to create the underline. However, [because the element is wide and contains empty space,](https://i.imgur.com/5fTgvVW.png) the `::after` seems like it underlines the empty space as well. This is because the text is right justified (`justify-content: flex-end;`).  A mitigation would be to shrink the `&lt;nav&gt;` container [but it is wide as well](https://i.imgur.com/PC0KK5W.png). `max-width: min-content` works but forces the word break on all screen widths.

This is where my css intuition ends, I can't figure out if there is a way to make it work. Is it even possible?

hqt6hx,"How to pass pointer events through transparent/bounding box areas of deeply nested, complex SVGs?","Hi guys. I have a sandbox for animated character and cartoon rigs that rely on certain After Effects tools like Lottie and Rubberhose controllers, making everything completely interactive in browser -- but an issue I'm running into is that SVG tags and [element bounding boxes will overlap and stack and block elements beneath from receiving pointer-events like here](https://gfycat.com/yearlybowedbrownbutterfly). Both ""rubberhoses"" here have controllers at each end, and I want to be able to easily click them regardless of stacking order without the bounding box of the green hose blocking access to the red.

I expected this to be something like:

    svg * {
      pointer-events: painted;
    }

Because this does affect all children tags/shapes when I add `stroke: red`, so I can see the selector is targeting correctly, but I've tried all the attributes for pointer-events on MDN and still can't come up with a solution for this. I'd really appreciate any tips or help on this, [the same demo above is live at this URL](https://rubberhose-demo.netlify.app/#/advanced/bbox).

What CSS or JS tricks can I use to ensure that any SVG elements pass their pointer-events through with exception to the ones with a selector of `[class^=""rubberhose-controller""]:not([class$=""-locked""])`? So that I can always move both the red and green hoses regardless of their bounding boxes and stacking order?",2,css,2020-10-13

hqdzqm,How to best make this navigation bar responsive?,"Hi all.  I have a navigation row built with floats ([see CodePen here](https://codepen.io/cagross/pen/KKVexaW)).  As screen width decreases, the third element in the row breaks to a new line ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/uMOYMZG.jpg)).  To resolve this, I assume switching to a flexbox layout would be the best and probably easiest solution.  But if I wanted to stay with the float layout, what are my options for resolving this issue?  

Can I perhaps ensure the font size of my text decreases with screen width?  If so, how can I do that without the use of so-called 'magic numbers?'

Right now I can't *easily* use flexbox because I'm using a CSS framework which uses floats and such ([W3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/)).  I've already noticed other deficiencies with this framework though, so perhaps this exercise will serve to convince us to move away from it.

Hi, I'm working on a text based game. For a while I've been using [this interface](https://imgur.com/1Irqwft). You'll notice the red and blue bars at the top left, and the top right. These are the players and enemies health bars.  It works fine but it's ugly and I'd like to do better. Problem is, I'm pretty decent with JS but my HTML and CSS skills are horrifyingly bad. I tried to use GIMP (which I'm also bad at) to create what I'm looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

[Something like this.](https://imgur.com/BdLZrOz) Please forgive the extremely thick borders. Something about GIMP doesn't play nice with thin borders. I was probably doing it wrong.

I've tried messing around with the CSS grid system, and bootstrap but didn't make much progress. I'd bet the interface I want could be made with those tools, I just need guidance to get there. All my code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/Bazill03/Text-Adventure-game) but I'll try to post the relevant code in this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the HTML:

hpwiwu,Is there any need for SCSS?,"Hello,

I'm just beginning to study to be a Salesforce developer, so I've been picking up HTML, CSS and JS during the pandemic.

I've been browsing CodePen for ideas and I came across SASS and SCSS. As I was looking more into it, I found that SCSS is basically SASS with CSS syntax, and that it has advantages over CSS in that it has variables, nested selectors, and so on. 

However, I thought CSS3 already has variables and all sorts of selectors? (--variable, and tons and tons of selectors I haven't even used yet: \[ \] and + and &gt; and so on, and nesting...). 

Main point:

What I'm trying to figure out is whether there's any literal advantage to SCSS over CSS, especially since, according to all these 1-3 year-old articles I'm finding, CSS3 written in an SCSS file is perfectly valid? I probably don't know enough about the history of either one to really understand whether SCSS is just more convenient, or actually has added functionality (like, for example, is it just more exacting, is it actually more capable with animation or selection or what).

I feel like I've missed the boat on SASS, SCSS, bootstrap and all that, but if there's anything that gets me further along before I start incorporating JS (my ultimate goal) then I'd like to use it.

honnqo,How to properly align elements across four columns?,"Hi all.  On my page are four columns, each with a `&lt;button&gt;` element at the bottom.  The buttons are not aligned with each other ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/09cqSXR.jpg); page [here](https://kabultec.dreamhosters.com/donate/)).  How can I best ensure they are aligned, and remain aligned as screen width decreases (down to 768 px)?

**Options  (as I see them)**

* Flex:  I'd like to use flex, but not sure if I can, because one of the parent elements (`.elementor-image-box-content`) doesn't have an explicit height assigned.  To calculate that height, it like I need to calculate the height of the image *above it*, and I'm not sure how to ascertain that with CSS only.  Can I?

* Height:  I can set the `height` (or `min-height` maybe) on each column.  But then I'd have to make sure that value increases as screen width decreases.  Not impossible I guess, but I might prefer a flex solution instead, if possible.

FYI the site in-question is a WordPress site, and the page has been built with a page builder.  Hence, all of the cruft in terms of markup, classes, etc.  I can change some of the markup easily, but not all of it :-/  But I can change/add any CSS (or JavaScript).

hnpsqz,Advice For Responsive Design In A High Resolution World?,"So I had an interesting issue come up at my current job. We developed a new landing page for the client and we QAd it across our browser versions and our list of resolutions. Everything checked out savor a few CSS adjustments needed.

We send off to the client for approval and they reply that the page looks really bad. So we ask for screenshots of the page on their computer as well as their device model number. Client has a 13inch laptop with a 1920x1080 resolution screen. So I take a look at the screens and I can immediately tell the page looks zoomed in, but the icon that appears in chrome is not in the address bar. I try zooming in anyway but the font scales fine.

I ask the client to go to their windows settings and send me their display properties in a screenshot. I see that 150% is the set zoom level and it is also the recommended setting. My buddy just got a new surface that has IIRC a 4k screen but zoom is set to 400% by default.

I found this chart from Dell that kind of explains what I am talking about.

https://preview.redd.it/ryyisntr8p951.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ab3b5a17e1b7c53b3a5c3edccd9f37a7fb17306

Obviously 1440, 2560, 1920 are all pretty common, but 1536? 1097? Not including how those scale when set to % above or below the recommended. I know that there are media queries for retina IE  [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/retina-display-media-query/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/retina-display-media-query/)

Is there anyway to somewhat plan for this? Or are just in a day and age where just to be safe its back to dragging our browser screens and checking bit by bit?  


EDIT: I may not have been clear enough this has nothing to do with the browser zoom at all. This is specifically zoom at the Operating System level.  


For example client has a 1920x1080 base resolution screen but its on a 13inch laptop. Windows sets the zoom to 150% by default and recommends it which effectively made the actual size 1280x720. Or could be more odd like the image shows above 1920x1080 at 175% which is 1097x617",1,css,2020-10-13

hnjkoq,Best practice to preserving UI state on AJAX refreshes?,"I have a site that relies on close to real-time data so most of the DOM markup is refreshed every 20 seconds. The markup does have a good amount of components for which user interactions toggle visibility state (think dropdowns, expanded views etc). I am mostly relying on native javascript and some jQuery, no SPA library in play.

When the updated DOM comes in through an AJAX call naturally all the visibility states of markup elements come in at their default. So dropdowns or expanded states would suddenly collapse for a user.

 Are there any best practices/lightweight libraries that deal with this challenge in an elegant manner? Right now I am saving state in the browser/through Cookies and on AJAX refresh reset visibility content; its somewhat of a pain in the ass to maintain and also leads to the UI flickering noticeably so I have a gut feeling what I am doing is really not the proper way.

hnhuk1,Card game interface - Need guidance to adapt to different screen sizes,"Dear Reddit,

I'm designing AI for a two players card game (Called ""The Fox in the Forest"") and for the front end I designed a web page. I'm just an amateur toying around with code and I'm struggling to understand the subtilities of CSS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (painfully) managed to design an interface but I'm struggling with several things:

\- When the web page is stretched sometimes you have to scroll to see the full board. Ideally, I would like for the interface to take the whole page but not more than the full page.

\- On mobile it is even more difficult to fit everything so I'm hiding certain things (the history of moves), still, the current status is far from ideal.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any advice on how to create a 1 page only interface adapted to my card game? How would you adapt it to mobile? Are there tools available to work on such layout?

&amp;#x200B;

A demo of the card game is hosted there:  [http://oripy.pythonanywhere.com/](http://oripy.pythonanywhere.com/) account is easy to create (no email required, just username/password), also a test account already exists username: ""Test"" password: ""test"". You can start a game from the Lobby by just click on ""New Game against TheBad"" or ""New Game against TheGood"".

hnbh45,How come so many solutions to solving layout problems are just: put &lt;div&gt; wrappers around your &lt;divs&gt;,"I'm just a noob, but feeling layout frustrations.  CSS is so 'artsy' to me, in that there's 30 ways to do everything, but none of them actually work unless you've aligned the stars correctly.

Pretty much 90% of issues I google, the solution presented is either something that doesn't line up with my efforts (No, I don't want to use Position to solve my layout issues - maybe I should?)  or just involves 'wrap another div around it'

Seems like I'm mixing Grids,  Flexes, Positions, and I never know when the right one makes sense to use.  The end result is that I just guess at patterns of CSS until it works, and when it does, it's often not a revelation, it's a ""oh, ok it works now... I hope I don't have to change that"".

And wrapping &lt;div&gt; around &lt;div&gt; after &lt;div&gt; just seems like poor workflow. I am making divs _just to get things to position correctly_.  Surely that's not recommended.

Are there any WYSIWYG editors for CSS?  I know Dev Tools let's you play around but that's a lot of trial and error and does little to reinforce methodologies.  I'd like something where I can just drag elements where I want them, and the css and html are spat out for me.  If design is going to be so artsy, then perhaps the interface to create it should match?  Is there anything like that?

ps: I am extremely happy to have my understandings solved.  I've got no problem with javascript, but the patterns of CSS escape me.  And I love patterns.

I think that's the other part is that I find most CSS sites with instructions or tutorials' examples (particularly for noobs) aren't relevant to what the noobs are trying to do, or simplify the problem to the point that it's not relevant.  They says ""this works"" rather than reinforce why the patterns work.  I'm often left unable to directly apply the ""knowledge"" I'm getting.

If there are good sources for you that clicked for making intermediate layouts, what are they?

edit: really appreciate all the replies so far!  everything helps improve my understanding (and maybe others as well), even if its ""learn to accept it""  :P

edit²:  my biggest takeaways since reading these responses that have helped the most today:

* adding &lt;divs&gt; isn't the enemy (assuming you know why you are adding them) and that when used right, &lt;divs&gt; allow you to isolate functionality so that you aren't trying to do more than you should within a &lt;div&gt; (e.g. presentation vs content)

* draw your layout and decide how content is arranged within the layout, rather than trying to fit content to where you want.  this has led to a strategic mindset up front letting me think about how the entire page's content is laid out, rather than a reactive mindset of struggling with individual problems.

* automatic web layout creation software won't teach you much about CSS (unless you have more patience than I) - the problems don't seem relevant

Because of these, I've now become a lot more comfortable in my workflow and am starting to approach problems with a strategic mindset, rather than a reactive mindset.  Because CSS has inheritance hierarchy, a reactive mindset isn't (imho) very ideal for debugging nor for developing an understanding.  I am now thinking about the whole page, and how parts within the page are constructed, rather than just trying to brute force a particular element.

Someone vaguely suggested something about floating point on images, but my knowledge of HTML/CSS is fairly limited. Below is an example screen shot of how the image does not take up the usable space, despite having the resolution to do so.   


I did add the following custom CSS to my homepage, but this did not help.

The line-height of the `&lt;input&gt;` element is 20px, so I'm not sure how adding it would increase the height of the container `&lt;div&gt;`.  I don’t see any other height or min-height attributes that might be the cause.

The end goal of this exercise is to ensure the height of this &lt;div&gt; is consistent across all four columns.  As an option, I can probably explicitly set the `height` of the element.  But I’m very curious why this behaviour is occurring.  Also, I want to ensure the dollar sign in this column is aligned with the text in the `&lt;input&gt;` field, in the same manner it is aligned with the text in the other three columns.  The issue I’ve described seems to be getting in the way a little.

hkgl98,Question: How to fix wrong nth-of-type count (influenced by surrounding elements),"Hi everyone,

I have another question regarding the :nth-of-type selector. 

Say I have tree divs with the same class and select them with the :nth-of-type selector, giving them different background colours. However, having another unrelated div (with another class) above them, throws off the count by one. 

The only way I've found to remedy this is to wrap the elements in a div, which I don't actually understand because the selections is supposed to be based on the class. Also, this is not really an option because these elements should be independent of each other (rather this option would be my last resort). 

DEMO: [https://jsfiddle.net/1v8jewga/](https://jsfiddle.net/1v8jewga/)

I guess this problem probably results from my lack of understanding of the :nth-of-type selector, but I can't see where my thinking is wrong tbh. 

I would really appreciate some helpful feedback from you! Thanks :D",5,css,2020-10-13

hjvr6t,A little help to correct a half-hidden WordPress widget?,"Hey guys, there is something I'm looking to fix on [my blog](https://septiemeartetdemi.com/) and I can't manage alone.

In the left sidebar, you will see [this](https://i.snipboard.io/l4ZvrN.jpg). There are two elements which, as precise as I can get the selectors to be, seem to be called `jetpack-simple-payments-purchase-box` and and `jetpack-simple-payments-button` but the whole thing is messy so maybe I got that wrong.

Part of the widget is hidden because the sidebar is a bit too narrow. I'll take any clever fix but I've been thinking of these two:

* put both these elements on top of the other (I've tried inserting `clear`s but that didn't help), then align them to the center of the sidebar **OR** ;
* reduce the width of the first element (considering that is enough to fix the visual glitch).

I hope I'm in the right place. \^\^ Thanks in advance!

hitt5g,Issue with nested CSS custom properties,"Here's the problem I'm facing:

- I defined a `:root` prop for a box-shadow: `--box-shadow-line`
- Inside of that prop, I'm using another prop to set the color: `--box-shadow-line: 0 0 0 1px var(--box-shadow-color);`
- In the scope of another element, I'm overriding `--box-shadow-color` and setting `box-shadow: var(--box-shadow-line)`. But my override isn't applying.
- The override *does* apply if I redefine `--box-shadow-line` in the same way inside of that element's scope, but I want to avoid that.


Is there any way to accomplish this kind of override? I'm assuming it's a specificity issue but I'm at a loss.

Full CSS:

    :root {
      --box-shadow-color: blue;
      --box-shadow-line: 0 0 0 1px var(--box-shadow-color);

    #foo {

hfzlru,Google Homepage div.sfbg element stupidity,"In order for everyone to understand what is going on here, I want to preface this with some background information, so please read carefully.

Part 1:

For over 2 years now I have used the Flavr Custom Google background extension, even though it hasn't been supported on the chrome web store for over a year and it barely works at this point, it works just enough for what I need it to do, which is change the super boring white background of the google home page to a picture of my choosing. In order to do this I had to do some file replacing and renaming in the working directory of the extension to change the default image it sets, as the makers of the extension no longer support it either, and apparently any image you uploaded to your background image repository got saved to one of their cloud servers for the app to use, but now that they don't operate those servers the extension can only use the images stored locally, those being the default images it comes with.

Part 2:

Another extension I use in addition to this is the midnight lizard extension, which is similar to dark reader and extensions like it in that it changes the CSS of websites to make them whatever color you want to, I have mine set to pitch black for the background color as default. I combine this with Flavr to make the google homepage have a custom background, and have the google search results display with a nice black background, this has worked without issue for me for years.

The Problem:

[An image of my homepage for reference.](https://preview.redd.it/byzdkz4s46751.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d995d493d930924713f1d1653d8838a76627ab3)

If you reference the image I posted, you'll notice this black bar running across the entire google homepage, I figured if I messed with some midnight lizard settings I could remove it, but that didn't work, as the background color slider is what affects it, so tweaking it via that extension was out of the question. If I disable midnight lizard the black line goes away, but then I can't have the nice dark search results. As a last resort I went to see if I could do anything meaningful in the inspect element window, and I found that the black bar corresponds to the element I highlighted in the picture: div.sfbg. If I reduce the margin-top value to 0, remove the element, or hide the element, then the black bar goes away and I'm happy... obviously until I reload the page since then it just reloads the original CSS code.

My Question:

How do I fix this? Either by downloading some extension like UserStyles and making a theme or by writing a script which deletes that element or something. If anyone knows some code I could write which would delete/hide that element automatically, I would be super grateful. I've never coded in CSS or Javascript, so I apologize in advance if you tell me how to do it and I don't fully understand. I'm really open to any solution, I just want that black bar gone.",3,css,2020-10-13

hfjdd5,Simple CSS Animation with Custom Properties &amp; Variables,"I was building out a 'stats' design that needed some animation depending on assigned percentage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the mockup:**

https://preview.redd.it/k4ic6eaby0751.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4b92e3b55e049f5e54ddedb7d3e493e2d126fee

&amp;#x200B;

My usual solution would be to have a data attribute on the 'bar' elements and then trigger the animation with a JavaScript loop (looping through each of the individual bars)

&amp;#x200B;

After playing around a bit, I found a neat **CSS solution**. Which was to add an inline style to each of the 'bar' elements

&amp;#x200B;

Within the inline style, I declared a variable ( ie '*--percentage: #%')* which would still allow me render dynamically with PHP

&amp;#x200B;

I then used the 'var' CSS function to apply that percentage to the element with a pseudo class. (and animated the bars with a keyframe)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's an example of a stats item HTML**

    &lt;div class=""stats""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""stats__item""&gt;
    	&lt;span class=""stats__percentage""&gt;27.5%&lt;/span&gt;
    	&lt;div class=""stats__bar"" style=""--percentage: 27.5%;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;span class=""stats__age""&gt;18-24&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the CSS properties used to animate and apply the percentage**

    .stats__bar {
        width: 67px;
        height: 158px;
        margin: 10px 0;
        background: #d5634e;
        border-radius: 4px;
        overflow: hidden;
        position: relative;
    }
    
    .stats__bar:after {
        content: '';
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        bottom: 0; // THIS IS WHAT WE'LL ANIMATE
        left: 0;
        right: 0;
        background: #433737;
        animation: barsIn 0.9s ease-in-out forwards; // CALLING THE KEYFRAME
    }
    
    @keyframes barsIn {
        0% {
            bottom: 0;
        }
        100% {
            bottom: var(--percentage); // APPLYING THE PERCENTAGE
        }
    }

j9oxkn,Wider Card View in New Reddit?,"The ""card view"", where you click on New Reddit's layout option, and get a few lines of text below each person's post is actually useful, and I like to select it when viewing some Subreddits. It's just that it's too damn narrow. 640px. I get that full-width text becomes hard to read on widescreen monitors, but 640px seems an odd design decision to me, and a search of Reddit posts suggests that I'm not the only one to think that.

I've no idea what I'm doing. I know some Python and C but I don't know CSS or Javascript. I clicked on ""inspect element"" in Firefox, and after discovering how to highlight the relevant layout elements, it seemed that a class called "".\_1OVBBWLtHoSPfGCRaPzpTf.\_3nSp9cdBpqL13CqjdMr2L\_"" has the style ""width: 640px"". So I Googled ""how to change a css class with tampermonkey"", found an example in [a Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19392142), and speculatively using that as a template, I put the following into Tampermonkey:

    // ==UserScript==
    // @name        Reddit Wider Card Layout
    // @match       *://*.reddit.com/*
    // @grant       GM_addStyle
    // @run-at      document-start
    // ==/UserScript==
    
    GM_addStyle ( `
        ._1OVBBWLtHoSPfGCRaPzpTf._3nSp9cdBpqL13CqjdMr2L_ {
    	      width: auto !important;
        }
    ` );

Well incredibly, that just worked immediately for me, and the ""card view"" is now about 850px wide on my 1280-wide monitor rather than 640px.

But I'm wondering why the name of that class was a long stream of random digits. Is that common? It looks like a dynamically-generated random-string. It works at the moment but I'd be surprised if it works tomorrow. Is it just the classname that Reddit serves to me or does anybody else see the same name?

Anyway, like I said, I don't know CSS, and I'm amazed that I've quickly Googled my way into a temporary fix that actually works. Can anybody suggest a more robust way to achieve the same result rather than something that relies on a long random string?",1,css,2020-10-13

j9cfyx,Always have problems positioning elements,"I've coded multiple websites, including the one for my local city hall, but I always have big problems positioning elements. I always manage to do it in the end, but it's by trial and error, not by knowing exactly how it works.

Especially when there's a div inside a div inside a div inside a div, with text,images and so on, at some point I don't know what works anymore, I just try everything: text-align: center, margin: auto, margin:0 auto, positioning with relative/absolute, float,grid,flex and something eventually works.

I know the theory, like margin :auto; = centers block level elements within a container, text-align: center; = centers inline elements, or that in order to use position relative or absolute I need to use position relative on the parent I want to position based on, and so on, but in the chaos that a big website eventually becomes, I get lost.

Sometimes elements don't have the width or height I want them to have, or they lose it, or their paddings and margins act weird, or sections with different vh act weird, or sometimes margin: auto doesn't work, and you get the idea.

    }

However, the Google Assistant STILL picks up a letter at times (maybe 10% of the times): https://i.imgur.com/jPTpFzq.png

I'm using the below code to hide the navigator on scroll instead, as demonstrated in [this W3 demo:](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_navbar_hide_scroll.asp)

    /* When the user scrolls down, hide the navbar. When the user

This is inserted in before the closing tag, in the footer section using the 'Insert Header and Footer Scripts' plugin in Wordpress. This still doesn't work and does not hide the navigator while the user scrolls down.
