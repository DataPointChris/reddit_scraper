g8pm2fn,jai0yr,"&gt;Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to kids.

https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle",1
g8pm5hq,jai0yr,"People tend to learn better when they can get a visual feedback and turtle is quite good at visualizing the basic concepts like variables, loops, conditions etc.",1

g8pl3yr,jahx5z,"tldrstory is a framework for building AI-powered applications that understand headlines and story text. tldrstory allows quickly scaffolding machine learning jobs, a backend API and front-end application to review/analyze the data.

A zero-shot classifier, backed by a large general language model with no labeled data, is used to label data. Additionally, a txtai index enables ad hoc similarity searches against the data.

tldrstory is built on the following stack:

\- txtai  
\- Transformers  
\- Sentence Transformers  
\- Streamlit  
\- FastAPI

Example application that uses the tldrstory framework to explore objectivity and bias in recent news headlines related to the 2020 US Presidential Election shown in video above.

g8ol70c,ja5y2m,"Done things that get overlooked (at least in my country) but really helps worth analytic thinking: 

##Set path:

- naive set theory: element, inclusion, universal set, union, intersection, venn and euler diagrams, extension and comprehension. 

- relations between sets. Relations to the same set.  Symmetric, transitive and reflexive relations. Equivalence relations. Ordering relations.

- functions (as relation between numeric sets). Domain, Coloma in, invective, suryective, bioactive, Cartesian pair, plot of point in the plane (number line should came earlier, learning sums. If he don't know this stop some weeks and learn him to make operations in the number line). 

- sequences. Show some examples. Make him guess the next term.

- linear function, translation, rescate,  intersection of linear functions (graphical and analytical) 

## modulo algebra path

- the clock. Operations over the clock. Modulo 12 (or 24)

- operations in week days. Modulo 7

- use modulo to show how some divisibility rules are derived

## numeral systems path

- Roman numerals

- decimal numbers (review here) 

- positional numbers

- others numerals, binary, ternary, octal, hexadecimal.  Conversion between them. Operations in each system (not making conversion from every side) 

Take 2 or 3 Martin Gardner books and pick the exercises at his level.",10

g8o7evi,ja5y2m,Multiple assignment or tuple unpacking,19
g8oxihl,ja5y2m,Thanks!,4
g8oz5yu,ja5y2m,"You can also use * to unpack things.

Like:

    class Container:
        def __init__(self, *args):
            self.items = []

            for item in items:
                self.items.append(item)
                

The *args part (when as a parameter) allow you to take any number of arguments and store them in a tuple.

One thing to be aware of is that you’ve declared attributes on the class, rather than the instance of the class. This means that the PDF can only be created once; you would not be able to have multiple unique spreadsheets created.

We don't want an endless stream of practice of the same old process just to shut the kid up during the lockdown. I'm not saying that's happening here, just pointing out that the kid might well be ready to move on to learning  the next item in the math curriculum. I appreciate that's a whole lot of extra work for the parent, which might not be that welcome.
