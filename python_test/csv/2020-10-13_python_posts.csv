jahty2,My current project: A notepad with a folder-viewer build in.,"Hello guys,

in the moment im building a python program what is a simple notepad, but you will be able to browse around folders in it, make new folders and text documents, and delete them. It saves the notes in txt files and organize it in folders. I want to get the basic functions running in the fall holidays.

I develop it because I want more freedom from Microsoft One Note (My school have it), and I now want a different place to save my private notes, because we found out that teachers have the permissions to look in it. The Sticky Notes from Windows 10 was a great alternative first, but it don't had the ability to put things in folders, and it looks ugly, when you have one big note on your desktop. It destroys the whole background.

Now its only able to read in the document and folder tree, it can resize the textarea and the scrollbar. And save and read .txt files. Now im adding the functions make new folders and notes...

jah41p,New machine learning Python package,"Hi all! I recently made a Python package I'd like to share. It dramatically simplifies a lot of machine learning tasks, including tasks such as choosing a model, training your model, natural language processing, and text clustering.

 Logistic Regression from Scratch in Python is a short video course to discuss an overview of the Logistic Regression Machine Learning Algorithm.  In this video different types of concepts related to Logistic Regression Algorithms such as Sigmoid and Optimization are discussed. Finally, the algorithm is implemented, step by step, in Python Programming language using Jupyter Notebook.

jaf51g,Austin -- CPython frame stack sampler v2.0.0 is now available,"I am delighted to announce the release 2.0.0 of Austin. If you haven't heard of Austin before, it is an open source frame stack sampler for CPython, distributed under the GPLv3 license. It can be used to obtain statistical profiling data out of a running Python application without a single line of instrumentation. This means that you can start profiling a Python application straight away, even while it's running on a production environment, with minimal impact on performance.

The simplest way of using Austin is by piping its output to FlameGraph for a quick and detailed representation of the collected samples.

Austin is a pure C application that has no other dependencies other than the C standard library. Its source code is hosted on GitHub at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin

The README contains installation and usage details, as well as some examples of Austin in action. Details on how to contribute to Austin's development can be found at the bottom of the page.

Austin can be installed easily on the following platforms and from the following sources:

Linux:

* Snap Store
* Debian repositories

macOS:

* Homebrew

Windows:

* Chocolatey
* Scoop

Austin is also simple to compile from sources as it only depends on the standard C library, if you don't have access to the above-listed sources.

Besides support for Python 3.9, this new release of Austin brings a considerable performance enhancement that allows it to sample up to 8 times faster than previous versions. But please do read on until the end to find out about some new tools that take advantage of all the key features of Austin.

Due to increasing popularity, the sample Python applications that were included in the main repository have been moved to dedicated projects on GitHub. The TUI can now be found at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-tui

while Austin Web is now available from

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-web

They can both be installed easily from PyPI, but in order to use them, the Austin binary needs to be on the PATH environment variable. These projects now rely on the austin-python Python package that provides a Python wrapper around Austin. If you are considering making your own profiling tool based on Austin, this package can spare you from writing boilerplate code, so it's worth having a look at it at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-python

The documentation is hosted on RTD at

https://austin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Finally, I am happy to announce the release of pytest-austin, a plugin for pytest that allows you to set up performance regression testing by simply decorating your existing pytest test suite. The plugin launches Austin to profile your test runs, meaning that no further instrumentation is required. For more details, check out the project on GitHub

https://github.com/P403n1x87/pytest-austin

Like the other Austin tools, pytest-austin can be installed easily from PyPI.

You can stay up-to-date with the project's development by following Austin on Twitter (https://twitter.com/AustinSampler).",1,python,2020-10-13

jaaqza,Little help with jupyter notebook and pandas,"Hi everyone,

I am working on a small project, and i'm having a problem.

I have a dataFrame which has 3 columns: Name, Value, Description.

&amp;#x200B;

|Name|Value|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|a|1999|good|
|a|46|bad|
|b|75|regular|
|b|30|regular|
|c|236|regular|
|c|1555|good|
|a|566|bad|
|a|55|bad|
|c|3222|regular|
|c|123|good|
|b|355|godd|

&amp;#x200B;

What i want to do is to take each values by their Name and run tests on them (for instance, sum, average, etc') and then remove the rows which fail those tests. 

The results should be that if a Value from ""a"" is bigger then 900, then it should be dropped.

I couldn't really understand what is the best way to do it.

I was thinking about for loop, but i couldn't make it work.

Thank you in advance.",0,python,2020-10-13
