geml7ml,k6ru7q,"txtmarker is a Python library that highlights text sections in documents. While this isn't a trendy problem, it's a complex challenge with limited open-source, permissively licensed solutions out there. txtmarker is Apache 2.0 licensed.

txtmarker currently supports PDF but additional formats will be added. txtmarker is built on top of pdfminer.six and pdf\_annotate.

GitHub: [https://github.com/neuml/txtmarker](https://github.com/neuml/txtmarker?new)

Example Notebooks:

[Part 1: Introducing txtmarker](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neuml/txtmarker/blob/master/examples/01_Introducing_txtmarker.ipynb)

gene1ye,k6m107,"I actually never ran into any issue with PyPDF2, and even for some of the projects I did for my clients.",1
gemzh1m,k6m107,"This is useful to know and certainly has its place I'm sure, but if your goal is easy PDF manipulation, I'd certainly recommend [PDFtk Server](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/) as a much simpler alternative. It's a free, cross-platform command-line tool for handling most of your common (and some of your uncommon) PDF manipulations.

For instance, this Python script would be replaced with `pdftk input_file.pdf burst` typed at the shell prompt. That command takes your input file, splits it into individual pages, and saves each page as a new, numbered PDF file.

I've incorporated PDFtk into Python scripts using the subprocess module before with great success, and when you start looking at some other common, free or open source tools like [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), you can start creating Python Scripts to do all sorts of interesting things.",1

gem4mfr,k6lh35,Thanks :),1
gem578c,k6lh35,Yes!  Python needs this for sure.  Why pydantic instead of data classes though?,2
gemi0kw,k6lh35,"Pydantic's BaseModel is basically like a data class with some extra convenience methods on it.

Usually when I'm using some third party API that may or may not have documentation, I write a Pydantic model to represent the shape of the data I expect. This tool just allows me to get that representation a little more quickly, and find edge cases when there are hundreds or thousands of objects to process - you can paste in an array of JSON objects, and it will create a model that correctly parses all of those objects.",2
gemscit,k6lh35,For me the main difference is that pydantic will ignore extra arguments and in a dataclass you need to create your own init for that.,1

gen0xvs,k6lh35,"Yep, it will handle nested content very well, and even complicated situations where you might encounter multiple types in the same field (union types).

Do you have an example of the JSON on hand?",1

gen1xdp,k6lh35,"Hello, Not-the-best-name: code blocks using backticks (\`\`\`) don't work on all versions of Reddit!

Some users see [this](https://stalas.alm.lt/backformat/gen1we1.png) / [this](https://stalas.alm.lt/backformat/gen1we1.html) instead.

To fix this, indent every line with **4 spaces** instead. It's a bit annoying, but then your code blocks are properly formatted for everyone.

An easy way to do this is to use the [code-block button in the editor](https://stalas.alm.lt/files/new-reddit-codeblock.png). If it's not working, try switching to the fancy-pants editor and back again.

gelf5ok,k6in34,"Is there a reason you didn't use the panda's library

Is it more efficient to process the rows as a multi-dimensional list",25
gelpnn0,k6in34,"IMO it's not necessary here. This code probably runs in under a minute which is fine for OP's use case. It also uses standard packages only which means it's easily adaptable for someone else to use on a different machine without requiring a custom environment. I know pandas makes things easy and fast once you know it, but there are trade-offs.",13
gelsxdl,k6in34,"Makes sense

Edit: using pandas is great for me because my employer requires me to do a lot of multi-dimensional analysis

for example they might want to know the average of a certain field based on years the months and a category of product

The amount of code that I would have to write to perform that multi-dimensional analysis by myself is cumbersome

so I've essentially become dependent on the panda's library even for the most simple reports",5
gem30nj,k6in34,"I find myself in the same situation. I love pandas, may even be over dependent on it; but it is powerful to use.",4

    real	0m0.954s
    user	0m0.699s
    sys	0m0.047s


-getdata downloads the file so that's obviously the biggest bottleneck and you don't want to download it every time you run the program so it's optional.",1
gemdqmv,k6in34,"Eh it's just a 2D CSV file where the cells don't contain any more than just a single piece of data.


Pythons string processing tools and the way data types are so easy to manipulate is great.

And the program really just subtracts the last two fields respectively from the previous day, then uses matplotlib (which I copied most of the code for). I only used numpy for np.arrange for filling under the curves. Pandas basically fundamentally changes how data is treated in python.


    file = open(file, 'r').read().splitlines()

Is what I normally use to read in simple text files because most files aren't corrupted and if you just want a list of the lines as strings (which is almost always the case) its simplicity can't be beat.

You can also do things easily with list comprehensions like the code below to get column vectors while skipping the heading. 

    cases = [int(i[-2]) for i in rows[1:]]
    deaths = [int(i[-1]) for i in rows[1:]]
     

You can just look at that and know what's happening instead of worrying about the abstractions pandas does. Don't get me wrong pandas is a fantastic library and it'd probably be quicker, but I didn't really need it here. 

I always use the json library though if there's a json file because that just is infinitely easier.",2
