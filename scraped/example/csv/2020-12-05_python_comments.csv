gepdgry,k77tdf,"Doing this as a decorator is an interesting idea and I'm a sucker for things that make us of Graphviz.

Here you are showing the arguments(s) and result (in square brackets) as a label to the tree node.  You can pass in HTML to the label which provides a lot more flexibility in formatting those arguments.  Also consider displaying a counter in the node label to show the order each  was (first) called.

Moving the result to be a label on the edge (arrow) could make the tree easier to read and more meaningful.",2.0

geowy11,k760wa,Thereâ€™s a balance to foundational learning and learning through actual practice.

geotvtw,k750k8,"I start by trying to flesh out an idea a bit with words. I try to describe functionality and write out statements that should be true. 

Usually Iâ€™ve thought about the idea for a while and the writing process helps to identify the best path forward. Sometimes Iâ€™ll completely stop from starting at all, which is valuable too. 

Then Iâ€™ll grab some paper and draw boxes for key components of the application. Giving them names helps at this point. 

From there I start to identify objects and data types and determine where any inheritance should occur if needed. 

So my mental model is a visual model on paper. This process usually takes a while and a few pages of paper as I iterate. 

Then once I start writing code, my goal always is to get the thing working as a walking skeleton first. Not engineering perfection or code supremacy. 

Iâ€™ll tweak the application around the edges once the thing is working as well: efficiency, readability, trade offs, etc. 

If I need to extend or feel like something needs to be more abstract, I will rework it at that point. 

This is maybe not THE optimal approach but itâ€™s what works for me on solo projects and with others. The people I respect the most as engineers all take a similar approach so Iâ€™m comfortable with it :)",5.0
geouksy,k750k8,"My mental picture is my boss saying ""oh, it works, can you do something completely different than what it is now? It must be possible with just one if statement, right? Two hours for adding completely new concepts?! Why so long?!"" ðŸ¤£

I am joking a bit, but this is not far from reality. My main challenge often isn't the complexity of the code as such, but the almost daily new requirements from the boss who has very little interest in understanding what is easy to do and what requires a big rework of the core code.

Due to this, I often invest quite a lot of time in what I view as preparation - I have huge modules with dictionaries and I like to overdo with writing functions so that I end up with a code that will allow me to easily swap components without making big changes in the core logic.

This highlights another thing - I think the way you approach it will always be determined to a noticeable extent by your specific case.",3.0
geoud5x,k750k8,"Interesting thanks. I like the paper thing, ill try that. I too though aim for functionality soon as possible, then every step or addition from there adds functionality without breaking anything else.

gep6a03,k750k8,"I generally aim to start with something simple, and then refactor when stuff gets painful. Some schools of thought say to start with the simplest thing that could possibly work.

The thinking is that you'll almost certainly have to change the code in ways that you didn't foresee. Rather than planning for all the problems you *think* you'll have, wait and see what problems you actually have, and keep the code simple until you know it needs to be more complex, so there's less to change when you do.

One thing this does rely on, that a lot of developers struggle with, is writing good tests.

Speaking a bit more personally, I also tend to hold off on making code object oriented until something pushes me in that direction. I tend to start with procedural code and just pass data around, until I encounter a need to bundle up some data items that often travel together, or need to encapsulate or abstract away some concept.",2.0

geoa7nd,k6xurg,"Just my opinion but I have been using macs for a few years now and they are just so much better in terms of something to code on and do work. Obviously if you are gonna be playing video games or something, mac is a stupid idea but otherwise they are great. I can get stuff done to a better standard and quicker on MacOS over Linux or Windows. I know I'll get a ton of downvotes for this but just wanted to put this out there.",3.0
gepa5bc,k6xurg,"Ok first off PEOPLE ARE UPVOTING YOU

Ok so the reason I dissagree with that is your probably using pycharm or VS, which pycharm should be the same between linux Windows and mac, but i believe VS is better in a mac then windows. This is why we do not use VS :). 

The main reason I don't like apple isn't their devices (ok maybe a little bit), but how the company behaves. They are just a shitty company. They make devices that will inevitably break, are poorly engineered, and then make you buy a new device rather then repairing the old one. They are lobbying against a law that will require companies to have some form of responsibility for child/slave labor. They are fighting against a law to reduce child and slave labor -_-. I have a 10 paragraph rant i can find",2.0

At this point they aren't even offering competative products.",2.0
