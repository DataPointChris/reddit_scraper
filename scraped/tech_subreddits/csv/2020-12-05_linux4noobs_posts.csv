k7b21m,"New battery for T400 + Linux, won't charge. What do?","Hi,

I bought a battery on eBay. I understand that might not have been the smartest. I clip it in to my T400 and it won't charge. I've tried it in both Fedora 33 and Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS and neither seem to charge. I have asked for a second battery, which they have provided, but, in the interim, are there any setting I can change in any Linux to see if it is either the motherboard or the battery?

Thanks BC7",1,linux4noobs,2020-12-05
k760ct,I hate grub bootloader," 

I have an Acer Aspire 7 i7 7th generation with Nvidia 1080ti

I have a 480gb WD GREEN M.2 SSD mounted on the motherboard with Windows installed on it.  
I also have a 1 TB hardrive.

I originally wanted to install both ubuntu and windows on the ssd for better performance, but i realized the grub bootloader eats too much time on the startup menu.  
Also I use ubuntu only couple of days a week for coding. Therefore I found it painfully slow to boot with grub.

So now what i am trying to do is install ubuntu on the harddrive with a 300 gb partition for ubuntu and leave the 700 gb to store music movies and other stuff.  
Here i kept the ssd as the top priority on boot manager so that i just boot into windows no questions asked; and boot into ubuntu with the quick boot menu in the bios.

This worked initially but the next time i rebooted my pc the windows boot manager simply does not show the second hard drive as a bootable device.  
However it is to be noted that I can access the 700gb partition with the files explorer so any faults in connection of the sata port can be ruled out.

TLDR ;  
My second hard drive is not showing up in the windows boot manager as a bootable harddrive HELPPP",0,linux4noobs,2020-12-05

Earlier, even after selection dark theme (within its setting-customize), Preference always remained bright.

k78z7d,Need help removing Grub4Dos and setting Windows 7 as boot,"Hello,

I'm quite alright with computers and know most of the things in BIOS, Windows, what needs to work for a Windows machine to run, etc., however, I have no experience with Linux and from what I understand Grub4Dos is a Linux program.

Anyways, I have a PC that my dad had gotten used from somewhere, and the computer works alright, but he wanted a better processor, so I tried putting in his SSD (where Windows is installed) and HDD (where his files are kept) into another machine. Its a Dell Optiplex 3040 SFF, and everything seems to be in working order in terms of hardware. The machine came with Windows 10 and the SSD has Windows 7, but I changed it from UEFI to legacy and turned on all the legacy support.

After putting in two drives it automatically goes into a boot loop, going to the Dell splash screen and then turning off. I can interrupt that and get to a screen where the background is red (at the top it says Grub4Dos) and it shows something like Windows 7 with SLIC loader and Windows 7 without loader, and more options with SLIC that I haven't tried. The Windows 7 load without the SLIC works and goes into Windows but seems pretty slow. The speed isn't my concern at the moment, as I just want to remove Grub4Dos. I read somewhere I can remove it by accessing the boot folder in my C drive (with the OS), but I have not found it there. I also can't find it as an application and searched the drive for it. Can't find any sign of it.

Does anyone have any advice on how to remove this and just get Windows to be the primary boot?

I'm considering reinstalling Windows and just backing up his files if I can't find anything working.

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks,

k76mnh,Why can't I write to this SMB share on Ubuntu Server that I'm accessing on Windows 10?,"I'm new to Linux and recently set up an SMB share on a new install of Ubuntu Server so I can access the file system from my Windows PC. I've edited the smb.conf file as follows:

    [My-Server]
       comment = Samba on Ubuntu
       path = /home
       guest ok = no
       read only = yes
       valid users = pedges
       write list = pedges
       create mask = 0755

What I'd like is for anyone who logs in with the username 'pedges' (the root account and only account on the server) with the password I set when installing SMB to be able to traverse and edit the file system.

Right now after entering my credentials I can see all of my folders and files, but if I try to edit or create a new folder, it tells me ""You need permission to perform this action"".

It might be worth noting that I also have an Unraid SMB share set up where I also use the username 'pedges' and the same password to log into that, so I don't think it's a Windows credentials issue.

k73oai,Installing Manjaro on a USB drive.,"Hello,

I have a work laptop and I want to leave the laptop untouched and no changes to the boot loader.

I need to be able to plug in a USB drive with Manjaro installed on it which also won't change anything in the work laptop.

I basically need a self contained portable operating system on a USB bootable drive that I can use like any other operating system but not modify my work laptops existing install in any way.

I need to be able to update manjaro and use all the existing laptop hardware.

How can I go about doing this.
Ideally I am thinking I should run the installer from another Linux based computer and install it onto my USB boot able drive.

Then plug the USB drive into my work laptop?

Many thanks

2. ALERT! UUID=xxx does not exist. Dropping to a shell!

I know all of my UUIDs, I just dont know what file I  need to edit to make this work.  I tried mdmadm.conf and fstab - no go. What file is feeding this Busybox / initramfs that I need to update with the correct UUID?
