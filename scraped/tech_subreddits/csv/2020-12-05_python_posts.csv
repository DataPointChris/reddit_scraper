I think learning from video is waste of a lot of time. But again since I only learn what I want to use. I have this fear of missing out.

k75abp,Would you watch this?,"Hey guys! I'm a Computer Science major and I'm currently working on my bachelor thesis project. It's essentially a ML algo trying to classify fake news. I'm super psyched about this project and I've been thinking about streaming the entire process, mainly because I think that you guys could help me a lot, and also because I might be able to provide some inspiration to up and coming programmers. I remember how terrified I was of the sheer amount of knowledge possible to aquire in this domain, so I wanna show people that this terror eventually becomes your dear companion and it actually is a big motivator to keep growing professionally. If you have some time, please let me know what you think in the comments.

P.S. If you guys reply positively, I'm gonna link you my yt channel, so you can stay tuned.

k749w9,Discovering the Y-Combinator with Python,"[Y-Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator) is a fixed-point (i.e. returning its own value i.e. a function applied to itself) combinator (think of it as a lambda expression that doesn't refer to variables outside its body). It is a construct that allows your programming language to run recursion even if your language didn't support recursion!

It is a two line description in the language of lambda calculus, but might not be that simple to implement without copying code. Imagine if your version of Python said I am not gonna support recursion- could you still do recursion? That's what it's about. [In this post](https://www.lambdacircle.com/discovering-the-y-combinator-by-mistake-1-2/), I used Python to 'try to discover' it step by step, and I must say that it was a beautiful night, and that Python is really a language that you can easily use to 'think in'. Thought I'd share it here (my first post ever!). Hopefully, this will also motivate you to dig deeper into beautiful ideas like the lambda calculus, type theory, etc. etc. :)

Basic summary:

\*\*\*

 IMPORTANT NOTE: You must have ebay api keys to use this application, you can register for them here (it's free but takes 1-2 business days for them to authorize your request): [https://developer.ebay.com/signin?tab=register](https://developer.ebay.com/signin?tab=register)  

\*\*\*

1) Take photo of multiple MTG cards together

2) Run mtg\_singles\_ebay\_listing with that image as input

3) Confirm or reject the given card name, card set, card price combo for listing. Hitting confirm immediately posts it to ebay under your account.

4) That's pretty much it, it's meant to be simple.",2,python,2020-12-05

k6z687,Python text based game movement,"I'm currently taking intro to scripting, and we are using python3. Our  main project is going to be a text based game. But for this week we are doing a sample project with basic movement through rooms in the game. They have given a dictionary of rooms and directions. I cannot seem to figure out how to code it. here is what I have so far.


A dictionary for the simplified dragon text game
The dictionary links a room to other rooms.


Rooms = {
        'Great Hall': {'South': 'Bedroom'},
        'Bedroom': {'North': 'Great Hall', 'East': 'Cellar'},
        'Cellar': {'West': 'Bedroom'}
}


def player_stat():
    print('----------------------------')
    print('You are in the {}'.format(currentRoom))
    print('----------------------------')


start player in Great Hall
currentRoom = 'Great Hall'
player_move = ''


while currentRoom != 'Exit':
    player_stat()
    player_move = input('Enter your move:\n')
    if player_move == 'Exit':
        currentRoom = 'Exit'
        print('Play again soon!')
    else:
        currentRoom = 'Great Hall'
        player_stat()
        player_move = input('Enter your move:\n')
        if player_move == ('South' or 'south'):
            currentRoom = 'Bedroom'

I know I'm missing a lot of rooms, but I am trying to write it in increments. The above code does not let me get out of 'Great Hall' and the 'Exit' command does not exit the code. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 
              P.S. I am not looking for someone to write the code for me but instead the correct way to actually layout and what code I need to use.",2,python,2020-12-05
