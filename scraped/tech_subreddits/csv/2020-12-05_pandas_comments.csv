gd6niwi,jys0vo," Pandas are [kind of awsome](https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/fascinating-facts/pandas), with their “thumbs” and bamboo-eating abilities. 

“The way in which the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, uses the  radial sesamoid bone — its ‘pseudo-thumb’ — for grasping makes it one of  the most extraordinary manipulation systems in mammalian evolution. The  bone has been reported to function as an active manipulator, enabling  the panda to grasp bamboo stems between the bone and the opposing palm. ”  – [Endo, Yamagiwa, Hayashi et al. (1999)](https://www.nature.com/articles/16830) “Role of the giant panda’s ‘pseudo-thumb’”
