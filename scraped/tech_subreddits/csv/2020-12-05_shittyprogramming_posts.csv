k2xy4p,Scuffed-Utils,"Hello, I'm Honestly Nuts. I'm somewhat new to python, even though I've been learning it since march (mostly because I got carried away with learning c and other languages). So, I wanted to get back into python with a project. I recently had an idea to make a Coreutils implementation in python and maybe add a few original programs in it as well (things like a unit-converter).

&amp;#x200B;

**But** making a Coreutils implementation alone is like cutting a tree with a butter knife. So, I want you guys to contribute to this project. Maybe one day we can make this something big.

This may look a bit/very nonprofessional because This is the first time I've asked people on the internet to contribute to a project.

&amp;#x200B;

##Lines That did not fit in the paragraph:

&amp;#x200B;

This way we can all get experience in working with people on the internet. I'm dumb. This is dumb.
