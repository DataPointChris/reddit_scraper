ge7o3d4,k3i9p7,"I understand where you're coming from. I'm trying to have a balance of education (explanation) and entertainment. But from my experience it's hard to please one or the other. On one hand, if I explain too much, it's harder to reach the general audience I want. And if I explain too little, the videos lacks the full picture (and for people like us who appreciate the ""science"" behind it, it lacks the science). I recently uploaded a video where I tried to do both better (explain + entertain) and it was a 26 minute video, which some might like, but the general consensus is that I ""explained too much"" even though I really tried to limit the explanation. The program itself is simple, but the most interesting part to me was explaining how I actually got the data (by reverse-engineering the Door Dash Private API).

ge4ffhk,k3i9p7,"I was thinking you could put a bit of error correction code in there to account for video compression, and basing that on QR codes makes sense. Just use as few pixels per block as is reliable.",1

ge41xzi,k3i9p7,"That's called steganography, and there are already tools for doing it.",8
ge5aa2w,k3i9p7,Are there tools for doing it in a YouTube video that circumvents any compression YouTube might be doing to an uploaded video? I'm pretty sure YouTube strips any meta/unused data from the video file you upload so I doubt steganography data would persist.,2
ge5e780,k3i9p7,"steganography involves embedding a message in another medium to conceal the fact that a message is even being transmitted. there are plenty of ways to do it that will work with a yt video. putting something in the metadata wouldn't really be steganography.

a rudimentary example would be using the lowest bit of the a, r, g, and b channels in a PNG image to encode some other bitstring. that gives you 4 bits per pixel in a lossless format.

since you use the least significant bit, the colours aren't really changed, so the image looks the same, but has a concealed message.",2

ge3tbb6,k3i9p7,"Each pixel can store up to 268435455 numbers, and we're using it to store just 2 of them. Nice!",10
ge41u0r,k3i9p7,"ehh, no. if you're using the standard RGB32 color format, then each pixel can store 24 bits of useful information (8 bits are used for an alpha channel, which is not used in video formats).

the black/white approach changes the bit depth of pixels to 1, so its efficiency in some sense is 1/24. not ideal, but not as inefficient as you imply.

the problem is that the compression format for videos is lossy, so you need error correction techniques in your encoding format. so you could never achieve perfect efficiency with this technique. 

the black/white approach is a rudimentary error correcting code. we can definitely do better, but some form of error correction is definitely necessary",7
ge4aulm,k3i9p7,"I absolutely agree. When I first released the project, some people suggested using qr codes instead of single pixels. This way we can use the error correction already implemented by qr codes.",2
ge4mn06,k3i9p7,"sure, although a more optimal approach would  probably take advantage of the compression algorithm used for YouTube vids. I think they operate in Fourier space, so it may be less error prone to also encode information in fourier space. this can be done using opencv

not sure on the specifis though.",1
ge51w5w,k3i9p7,"I haven't heard of Fourier space before, that's definitely something I need to look into. That's what's cool about sharing projects, there is always someone more knowledgeable that has some really cool input. Thank you for sharing.",1
ge594wj,k3i9p7,"MPEG-4 specifically uses a discrete cosine transform. It's used to drop out high-frequency patterns in an images colours.

This means that encoding pixel-by-pixel would probably be a lot more error prone, since noisy patterns might get dropped by the compression algo.

You might have luck encoding data pixel by pixel up to some frequency threshold, then running an inverse, real-valued dft on a frame. that could make it robust against aggressive compression.",3
ge6hzby,k3i9p7,It’s probably not wise to be dependent on the internal optimization of a company known for over engineering shit,1
ge739ag,k3i9p7,? the DCT technique is a staple in image compression. its the core of JPEG and MPEG-4 frame compression,1
ge4iidi,k3i9p7,I believe that there are some video formats which do support an alpha channel but youtube probably doesn't support that anyway,1
ge5eg0z,k3i9p7,"it's actually moot, since mpeg-4 uses a completely different colorspace (Yuv)",1
ge45n6y,k3i9p7,"You could probably increase the information density of each frame by going beyond just two colors for squares. If you had maybe 32 or 64 different colors, you could match each square to the value of the closest color.

Alternatively, you could still encode the binary data just in the colors of the squares, but ignore the least significant bits of each square's color. So maybe just take the first 4 of the 8 bits used for each channel of the color in a certain spot, for instance. That would let the color change a certain amount before it starts affecting the important data bits.",3
ge4amx2,k3i9p7,Oh that's and interesting aproach. I didn't think of that.,2
ge5ek35,k3i9p7,"In general, this concept is called Hamming distance: the number of bit flips to convert one symbol into another.",3
ge4w23t,k3i9p7,"Compression might not only change the color values but could also introduce artifacts. The problem is that you cannot test this after uploading, since youtube might re-encode your video with lower quality a few years later. I have some very old videos on youtube that used to be high quality but now are only available in potato quality.",3

gdosxj7,k12rzo,"That value is chosen because it’s approx 2^-1071, which when you multiply some double precision float by it will shift that number into the “subnormal range”, which will start rounding off binary digits.  I’m sure in practice 10^-322 will work fine as well if you try it.",5

Honestly I wish more of the r/shittyprogramming stuff posted here had to do with incorrect application (oh hey I tried implementing design pattern X, but there was an unexpected consequence type of thing), rather than just “Look guys, my teacher made a typo on one of fifty assignments”, or “oh my god, a byte is being wasted, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?”

gdjkrbo,k00wi2,"&gt;You, and your compiler too. IIRC C/C++ shorts store two bytes of data but allocate 4?

I don't think is true. There are alignment requirements in most CPUs so you may have unusable padding bytes in some cases - but this is for speed, not for safety.",1
gdjl6l8,k00wi2,"You may be right. That said the point still stands insofar that it will allocate enough bytes for the maximum possible value, whether you’re storing that value or not. Memory at the byte level is constantly wasted in some way",1
gdjorlo,k00wi2,"You're right, but I don't consider this a problem of wasted bytes - this is a problem of poorly-specified functionality wrt. memory.

From an information POV, these are different problems. The reason the compiler must allocate the full size of a numeric type for a variable is because the size must be decided by function run-time AND the variable must support the full range of values at run-time, since a) C compilers don't have to capability to statically infer the used ranges of variables and b) the value may depend in some way on external info, which is impossible to statically analyze anyway.

However a program/function with ambiguous semantics (especially if it's about memory-safety, which may or may not be the case here) is definitely something that can be improved!",1
gdjrp8k,k00wi2,"That’s true. I’m mostly being a bit defensive of the code here because I’ve experienced some similar peculiarities when working with Unicode and ASCII conversion in C++ recently. Storing c++ wide string in 7-bit narrow c++ strings for example often leads to a longer string than the original (for escaped format characters and stuff like that), and the exact byte size of the underlying wide char isn’t even standardized across systems, so I would assume similar issues may tie into the estimation problem here as well. It’s easy to look at the function and say “oh well that’s shitty programming”, but in the end none of us are really gonna go fix it ourselves either 🤷‍♂️

I do agree that there’s room for improvement though!",1
gdhujed,k00wi2,"This seems like a terrible idea. It doesn't understand the reason and mechanism are understood at all (if they are, the comment should link to an explanation or bug ID or something). If it is wrong by 2 bytes, who's to say it isn't, particularly in maliciously crafted examples, wrong by 2,000 bytes? If you don't understand why it is sometimes wrong, it is a bug you need to track down, understand, and then allocate exactly the amount really needed. Just adding 5 bytes and hoping that will be enough is not a good idea.",10
gdjnwix,k00wi2,"The note is really confusing. How does the user know how many bytes they might need anyway? And why does cJSON need to estimate anything?

It makes me think it's not about memory safety at all - my guess is that they check the estimate against the buffer length as an optimisation, to fail early before serialising much. If the estimate passes then serialisation is performed, returning a bool of whether it is truncated according to the buffer length argument. This means that the estimate can only be under and not over, in which case it might be fine? Or maybe the function returns true if the estimate passes, regardless of truncation, and so the extra 5 bytes is to ensure the data is a complete?

gcex7rg,jugqs0,"&gt;	2) Namespaces. If you want your code to be reusable -- always use namespaces.

I assumed he wasn’t being serious when he implied namespaces are overengineering. Anyone who has worked on a codebase with more than a handful of dependencies or a handful of developers knows how important namespaces are. 

As the amount of code increases, the chance that there will be some naming collision also increases. Imagine if you went to commit this code but found out that there’s a different Shape class defined somewhere else in your codebase. Now you have two distinct definitions of the Shape class in the same codebase. That’s eventually going to break something. Using namespaces is an easy way to solve this problem.",5
gcfoa6m,jugqs0,Though I suppose namespaces will not actually help you avoid name collisions within a single vocabulary. The exact same thought process that goes into placing two Shape class declarations into different namespaces is the exact same thought process that would otherwise name the Shape classes more appropriately.,2
gcfsdxb,jugqs0,"Depends. Shape is not a particularly descriptive name, so in this case that's true. However one could easily imagine a situation where there are multiple components with similar (but different) functionality that could accidentally be named the same thing. Namespaces help in this case. 

In a language without namespaces, you typically have to add some prefix to all the types and functions you define in order to prevent collisions. This can make the names very long. With a language that has namespaces, you can use namespaces to keep the names shorter.",2
gchi1zj,jugqs0,"Yes - my point is they don't substantively prevent name collisions, it's mostly a convenience for name qualification. I suppose they do prevent them if the language supports namespace aliasing (e.g. `import X as Y`), which actually changes how a name is qualified as opposed to just being another mechanism for qualifying names. Additionally, in a compiled language a name collision is detected at compile time, so it's not as if one must act defensively against this case. Personally I see namespaces as much more useful for managing multiple vocabularies, e.g. using libraries.

Anyway, neither my point nor the video's is that namespaces are bad; just that that clarity comes first, not using a check-list set of features that may be useful one day, maybe. That's what makes programming an art - to show what is important!",1

gbxd2l7,js3822,"Right in the feels.

Also the complete nonsensical idea behind the fact that the code you write inside the GUI / app builder is packaged in a binary, so any effort of tracking code via git goes down the drain.",8
gbxiihb,js3822,"the file format is also pretty ""fun"". I had the ""pleasure"" of writing a parser and serializer for that format for a company that does pretty much everything with MATLAB and SIMULINK once.",9
gbzxz44,js3822,What kind of monsters would do that?,3
gc00fqe,js3822,"they effectively used matlab files as a data interchange format between different tools. some recorded data from things the company built, soms analyzed it, and produced new matlab files. They also had other data formats, and one of the internal tools needed import and export of matlab, since they at that time did the conversion manually in a second step.

The mat file format is pretty wild:

It's one big list of type, length, value blocks, one after another.

the types are

- Integer (8, 16, 32, 64 bit, signed and unsigned)
- Double and Single precision float
- Matrix
- ""Compressed"" (really means zlib data containing matrix)

Matrix is funny, since it contains a second header containing the rows, columns, and type of thing in the matrix. also, every matrix has a name, because of course it does.

that is however a _second_ kind of type, with different constants for the same primitive data types I listed earlier. matrices come with a ""flags"" field that is left empty for most matrices. matrix only also has new data types such as CHAR. if I remember corrextly, there was some kind of weirdly hacked in unicode support as well, but that's badly documented (don't worry, the unicode support is not the best)

the matrix header also contains the number of dimensions and the size of each of them. Matrices are stored in column first order, and if the complex flag is set, then the imaginary values are stored in column first order after the real part matrix. (yes, you can have complex CHAR matrices in the file format, I don't think they make sense)

strings can only be stored as matrices. an array of strings is therefore a 2xN matrix, filled up with null bytes.

yes, they store [""hello"", ""world""] as ""hweolrllod"".

if you have a matrix containing different data types (e.g. in one column double, in one column complex long), then you get a matrix of 1x1 matrices. yes, that means you have a matrix header for ever element. talk about overhead.

There's also the ""struct"" matrix type, which is a matrix where I believe each column also has a name. the names are defined inline before the data. there are a bunch more special types for sparse matrices and ""object"", but that's too much detail I think.

every global variable in the .mat file must be a matrix (with the global flag set). the variable name becomes the matrix name, and if the variable was just a number it becomes a 1x1 matrix.

Also, at the beginning of the file, after the magic number, there are a few hundred bytes of ignored data where you can write a plain text description into.

This was Mat5. the newer Matlab 7.3 format I think uses HDF5.
