k7aptn,First AWS certificate to take,"I am planning my journey to take on the AWS SysOps Associate certification (first ever one I am doing). As a starting point for learning  material and practice exam papers , what do you guys recommend I should look in to. 

Am not sure if this would be the correct certification  for me as my interest is within the field of DevOps and the learning path suggests I should take the sysops certification first before taking the DevOps one. 

I currently test code before having it released which involves me monitoring and debugging applications that are deployed via AWS Codepipeline",2,awscertifications,2020-12-05
k7ant0,Practice Exams | AWS Certified Developer Associate 2021 by Stephane Maarek &amp; Abhishek Singh,"I got my DVA exam coming up next week and I have already completed Jon Bonso's : AWS Certified Developer Associate Practice Exams which was fucking excellent btw. Now I still got another week to go so I thought it would be a good idea to buy Stephane's exam course and ...

Wow, just Wow!!! 

I completed two sets of questions from the above mentioned course on Udemy and I have to say that I'm totally SHOCKED! 

Totally SHOCKED, I tell you...!!!

It is obvious to me that Stephane had no hand in compiling these bizarre questions and I'm really disappointed that he had the good mind to affix his exceptional reputation on to this rubbish. Just to make a fast buck I assume... Really sad.

The level of English grammar of these questions are so bad that even my six year old niece could outclass this baloney. The wrong prepositions and long-winded sentence structure, totally befuddles what the questions are attempting to ask. Not only this, but most of the questions are either asking about some general trival concept or some obscure factoid that is totally out of scope from the Associate Developer curriculum.

Stephane should stop trying to turn a fast-one and focus on the high level of content that we expect from him. 

I'm now going to give the exam prep course of Neal Davis a try.",2,awscertifications,2020-12-05

To summarize:

* 4 days of studying (exam was on very early morning)

* Half-assed the 2nd half of the introductory Cloud Practitioner Essential by skimming most of the text (I know, reading is hard)

* Completed the exam itself in 20 minutes

* Passed with a 920 / 1000

I had 0 prior AWS experience. Used Bonso tests for prep.

* Rather confusing and much more difficult than any of AWS's training materials. Rote memorize all of the services and know your stuff! You definitely cannot half ass this one.",3,awscertifications,2020-12-05
k6qe96,Seeking advice: Passed SAA-C02 but have no commercial experience,"Hi

I am new to the IT space, having recently decided to change careers from a metallurgist in the oil and gas industry. I graduated in Physics and Computer science more than 10 years ago and have done little to nothing related to computing.

Due to the downturn, I decided to look at the cloud and I successfully passed the AWS SAA-C02 Solutions Architect Associate course after 3 months of studying. I am having trouble landing my first job and having looked at junior roles, all of them require at least 3 years of experience in the industry as well as working knowledge of other technologies - Docker, Kubernetes, Python etc etc.  

I am now in this horrible place where I am being overlooked for junior roles because I do not have any experience, and to gain experience I need a job.

Anyone else had the same issue and what advice can you give to a 40 year old who is changing careers? Any advice most welcome.",10,awscertifications,2020-12-05
k6p4nf,AWS Certs and Career Advice,"Hi Guys,

I need some career advice, here is some info about me

So currently I am 4x AWS Certified, having done the following in the past 5 months:

\- AWS Cloud Practitioner

\- AWS Solutions Architect - Associate

\- AWS SysOps Admin - Associate

\- AWS Developer - Associate (Perfect Score of 1,000)

I am currently studying for DevOps Pro and plan to clear it in January.

I am an accountant, switching careers and trying to make it into DevOps.

For this I have been studying for almost 2 years.  


Initial Plan was to get into Full Stack (React / Node.js) Development but seeing the market saturation, I decided to get AWS certified and try DevOps.

For Front-end I know:

HTML / CSS (Grid / Flexbox) / JS (ES10), Typescript, React (Router, Styled Components, Redux, Cotext API)

Back-end I know:

Node.js (Express), Building REST API, JWT Tokens, SQL (PostgreSQL), MongoDB

(I built a small e-commerce website using this, along with Stripe API integration - adapted from a course I was following learning this. There are other small projects as well).  


But seeing the poor market response, I decided to learn more about DevOps. This is when I started doing AWS and fell in love with the platform, and the power it offers.

I am focusing on AWS right now. But to be able to pass these papers quickly I built up my background knowledge. I followed COMPTIA's A+ 1&amp;2, Network+, and LPIC 1 &amp; 2 for some Linux knowledge, but did not appear in the cert exams for these courses.  


Furthermore I plan to learn Python (I know basics already), Terraform, Kubernetes (Maybe get my CKAD) and Ansible.  


I heard that AWS certifications are really valuable and some firms require people who have Professional Certs. That is why I am doing DevOps Pro.  


Am I doing on the right path. Is there some career advice you guys can give on how I can get my first break? Will I be able to get a job if I have done these? I plan to finish all of this by Feb 2021 and get into full job hunt mode.  


I am feeling a but lost now, any advice would be appreciated.  


TLDR: Was an accountant, zero tech experience, started learning Fullstack JS, got interested in DevOps and started learning AWS, did all of the above, what do I need to do to get into DevOps?",7,awscertifications,2020-12-05
k6o9l3,CCP Passed,"Hey guys

Just wanted to share my experience for those interested in CCP

2 weeks intense study just followed Stephanâ€™s udemy course along with his udemy exams

Thanks to my over 10 years of IT experience I managed to pass but if youâ€™re planning to rely on purely on Stephan Iâ€™d say the real exam is way more difficult so you may want to add some variety if your level of experience is not that sufficient 

Also few words on proctor based test, can tell the worst experience Iâ€™ve ever seen, waited in the checkin page around 1 hour watching my live stream then contacted their online chat on my mobile phone browser finally someone called and asked me to restart my pc then it went smooth so try to make those pages available in the browser background 

Good luck",12,awscertifications,2020-12-05
k6l0on,Passed DVA-C01 with 937,"Follow up to my first post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/jrnczi/passed_saac02_with_802/

Started studying 8/8/20, passed the test 12/4/20. After ~4 months.

Took my test the morning of 11/3/20 in person through a Pearson VUE site and got my score back the next day. Passed with an 937. I was a lot more confident with my test this time around, I flagged 23 questions for review and my logic was that if I got those down a 50/50 guess then I would still pass so I didn't review any.

**My background:** 

I had 0 prior AWS experience outside of a basic project consisting of an EC2 instance and RDS database. Company needed someone with AWS experience so I started learning. Started with the Developer course and upon finishing that I needed to work on some system architecture stuff for work so I switched over to the Solutions Architect course and went through the non-overlapping sections. Decided to do the SAA exam first and then did the DVA exam after.

I used the Maarek courses and Bonso tests for prep. 

**My prep was as follows:**

* Maarek Developer Associate course between 8/8/20-9/18/20
* Maarek Solutions Architect Associate course between 9/22/20-10/11/20 
* Bonso SAA tests between 10/17/20-11/9/20
* Maarek test and supplemental 11/2/20
* Bonso DVA tests between 11/14/20-12/2/20
* Maarek test 11/29/20 and 12/2/20


I used the same general strategy as with SAA where I took a test, reviewed what was incorrect or flagged for review. This time I did a slower approach because there were less available tests and would do a test one day and a study session the next day. I saved Test 4 and Maarek's test as validation tests. I panicked because I failed both validation tests leading to a pretty anxious/grindy test week but I will touch upon that in a post mortem later.
I tracked my scores:

| Bonso Tests                    |          |          |          |   |

So I think the practice tests for this exam are a bit off compared to the amazing coverage with the SAA exams. They serve as great study material but are not true to the format of the exam. The questions in the real exam were a lot less wordy with most prompts being 2-3 sentences rather than the SAA test where they would have a whole paragraph. This made the test a lot easier to get through and a lot less mentally taxing. In addition, it felt like the DVA exam did not have as many tricky questions compared to SAA where to get the answer right you often have to pick between 2 very similar answers.

I am happy to be done taking exams and courses for a bit. This was a nice throwback to college but reminded me how much I hated having an exam looming in the future. My future will be more building with AWS for work and maybe starting a SAP course that is more project based sometime early next year.

k6efbo,"SEX!, now that I have your attention, this is just a GENERAL QUESTION!","Hi all,

A friend working in the tech industry has recommended to me multiple times to get an AWS certification.

Since I'm taking prereq's to return to college for computer science degree I thought ""What's another few courses?""

I didn't see any wiki or FAQ for this subreddit so that's the purpose of this post.

I could have done more research but between a full time job, college and a baby I thought I'd ask you fine folk instead.

A quick google search for cloud related positions returns the similar results as looking for entry level programming jobs. In short, it seems like a ""gold rush"" scenario, where there doesn't seem to be many (any) entry level jobs but instead a plethora of teaching or faceless recruiter related positions (what I'd consider to be ""leeches"").

So where are the opportunities!? Not necessarily looking for straight entry level but what should I be keeping an eye out for?

Thanks in advance for any informed replies.",0,awscertifications,2020-12-05
