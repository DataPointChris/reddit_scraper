k7b8i9,DBA is telling me dm_exec_query_stats and other DMVs are now useless in SQL Server 2016. Does this make any sense?,"At work I have been using various queries put put together using DMVs to look at execution times, index usage, etc, during the QA stage before we would put out a final release of our product. Our machines were running 2008 / 2012 because that was our base compatibility at the time.

A while back they upgraded everything to 2016 moved everything to AWS, on what seems like a very underwhelming server. Initially it had 62GB RAM allocated to a box with 32 databases loaded on it. We got them to double it eventually because of performance issues but still doesn't seem great.

After they moved everything to this server, the cached plans and all the DMVs basically only hold info for maybe a few seconds at most. Prior to the move, they held for 24hrs+.

I ended up pushing on this issue enough that they set up a meeting with me and their DBA. She informed me that 2014 changed the storage method for caching data, and those queries are now useless for any version of SQL Server over 2014 because the caches are constantly being cleared because that's ""just how it is"" and there's nothing we can do about it. I showed her the logs where SQL Server is complaining about a low memory state, but she said that has nothing to do with it.

I don't recall seeing anything that would lead me to believe these DMVs are now officially worthless. It seems like she's basically just fudging to get me / our office to shut up about the issue and make it go away without fixing anything. Is this basically what is happening here?",2,sql,2020-12-05

Is there a basic template for completing a cross server (database) join? In particular I’m looking for the SQL query to establish a connection to both databases and then join on an employee ID. 

I attempted this with ToadData Point, using the query builder, but it says this is not possible without the professional version... maybe just the query building part... (it said I’d need to connect via ODBC to one of the databases, and that I cannot join two tables in two different servers without the pro version using the GUI). am hopeful that the SQL syntax can do the connection and the join.

For example:

Join table sales_rep_performance in databaseA on employee_ID to table overall_performance in DatabaseB

My workaround, for now, is to just put this code into a script that's not included in the SSDT build.

k6pf5l,Conditional Join to another value (not another table),"Hi, this seems like a simple thing to do but maybe I am approaching it wrong. I've tried searching for a solution to this but couldn't find any for wanting to change the value to join on. I have two tables representing Comps and Users for specific ID's. I want to create a combined table where the Comps and the Users get matched up in a certain way. Here is an example:

Have:

Table A

|ID|Comp|
|:-|:-|
|Frank|1|
|Frank|2|
|Mary|1|
|Mary|2|
|John|1|

Table B

|ID|User|User Info|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Frank|1|blah|
|Frank|2|blah|
|Mary|1|blah|
|John|1|blah|
|John|2|blah|

&amp;#x200B;

Want - All the comps, and the matching user. **If no matching user, match to User 1**:

&amp;#x200B;

|ID|Comp|User|User Info|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Frank|1|1|blah|
|Frank|2|2|blah|
|Mary|1|1|blah|
|Mary|2|1|blah|
|John|1|1|blah|

&amp;#x200B;

The actual values between the Comp and User column are actually 1, 2, 3... in my database, so they are matched together and any approach defaulting the join to user 1 should work. I just don't know how to condition it to join to user 1 if the equal match fails.

These are the scenarios:

1. ID Frank - equal number of comps and users
   1. 1 gets matched to 1, 2 gets matched to 2
2. ID Mary - more comps than users
   1. 1 gets matched to 1, and because there is no User 2, Comp 2 gets matched to User 1
3. ID John - more users than comps
   1. 1 gets matched to 1, User 2 doesn't get matched

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my current code:

    select
    a.id,
    a.comp,
    b.user,
    b.userinfo
    from a
    
    left join b
    on a.id = b.id
    and case when a.comp = b.user then 1
        when 1 = b.user then 1
        else 0
        end = 1

I wrote 1= b.user to force the extra comp in Mary to get matched to user 1, but this actually creates duplicates and creates an extra line for Frank matching comp 2 to user 1. I am not really familiar with how case when works in a join statement, don't know why it did both the equal match and the user=1 match for Frank. I am at a loss at how to approach this.

k6gyt6,Just got promoted to my first Reporting position - Can any vets give me insight on pay/skills?,"Hey all,

At the start of the pandemic I took a remote job as a tech support agent for a large call center corp. Entry level gig, around 30k a year.

6 months in, with a lot of persistance, I landed a position as Reporting Agent. Minimal raise, but I have never been so excited about a job! The thing is, I'm almost positive I'm getting grossly underpaid. I'm super grateful for the opportunity, and I am going above and beyond to try and build my resume for when I start looking to level up.

I am unsure of what positions I should apply to when researching other companies because I'm having a hard time translating my responsibilities and achievements into resume bullet points. Hoping someone hear can give me some insight.

I'm a little under 90 days into my new position, Here's a list of my responsibilities and achievements so far:

Weekly Tasks-

Use a SQL query to pull data from a MySQL database, and format the data to be processed by myself and a coworker

Listen to segments of between 200-400 calls a week to validate data entered by entry level agents

Submit between 100-200 ""training opportunities"" for infractions found when reviewing calls and their notes. These goto managers for agent reviews.

After data on calls have been validated, i generate another report, extracting additional infractions for inaccurate documentation

Monthly -

Every month my department sends out summaries to 20 different manufacturers which sell their products in our client's stores (think top 3 retail chains). I am responsible for 7 of these manufacturers summaries.

The summaries include the amount of times our call center received calls for their products, most common issues, most common unit, etc.

These reports are seen by upper management in not only my corp, but also all of the corps that i send them out to.

Achievements-

We are currently preparing to transition from a CRM that runs a 20 year old version of Business Objects over to Oracle. Operations wants to change the font color of a line of text, in 11k different items in a database. All edits must be done manually through admin dashboard.

I built a Node.js web bot that automated this simple find and replace task, saving hundreds of tedious man hours. This has caught my bosses attention.

Because of this success, I was invited to a meeting with the oracle dev team for another transition issue. Because I spoke up at the meeting, and knew what i was talking about, I landed an assignment to completely restructure our Product database.

A week later, and today I was the lead speaker at a progress meeting, and was given 3 people to offload any tedious work to so that I could be free for any other projects that might pop up.

I have never had a job in the IT field, but always wanted to go into coding. While I am using code in some projects, most of my tasks seem to fit under the title of Reporting Analyst, but that doesn't match my title or my pay.

With some more time in this position, can I leverage this job for a better paying position? What positions would be relevant for this? I have no degree, but have heard that experience can offset this in some fields, is this the case for reporting?

Any tips appreciated! Thank you!

k6akzk,Questions regarding how to facilitate internships/work as DBA,"Hello everyone!

In a year I am about to graduate as Systems Engineering and even though I have studied from Java, Python to CISCO Networking I must say DB is what caught my attention the most. There is two courses during my whole degree that are exclusively dedicated for DB. 

DB I and Advanced Databases. During the courses I worked with Oracle SQL (server had to be on campus to be able to access the DB) and Oracle APEX (final project involved developing a DB using APEX for a company which I chose the family company) as for the next course I worked with Apache Cassandra, Mongo DB and Pentaho Data Integration. I must say that out of all APEX is the worst (at least back then) and I have no interest whatsoever on continue working with that. 

As my graduation comes closer I can start looking to apply for some interships here in Mexico as DBA but as a new member I have seen some questions of people asking for certifications and so on. My following questions are:

1. What certifications gives prestige to the resume?
2. What certifications may interest the companies I may apply as internship?
3. From all the servers available would you consider MySQL the best one to start practicing again?
4. If there is someone here that works or had worked as DBA intern/contract/employee what was your experience like and how much the field has changed?

There is a company relatively close from my city that has DBA available and I would like to apply. I haven't forgotten everything it is just a matter of me sitting down and start playing with DB like I did a year ago. 

I am waiting for your comments.

k6a0sc,Recommendations for DB product,"Hi,

Not sure if this is right place to ask but am looking for a db product.

Right now I store a few large large tables that have a few terabytes of data.  Each table is has a few gigs per date,  and data goes back  a number of years.  Currently this is stored in sybase using clustered by date.  The problem with sybase, at least in my set up is that it is too slow to get all the data out or to reload all the data.  I have no idea if it is a network bandwith issue, or a disk issue etc. 

So I converted all these tables to binary data files and store the tables in a file structure with each file representing one date.  This works very well and is much faster to load all the data into program or generate all the data from scratch and re write the files.  

I can keep this solution but it is somewhat cumbersome in that adding a column is just cumbersome.  

So am looking for non sybase solution that is very fast to load and read all the data.  I prefer something free.  Does such a product exist ?",0,sql,2020-12-05
