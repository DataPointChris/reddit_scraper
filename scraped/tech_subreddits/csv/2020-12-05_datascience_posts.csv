k7bvp8,"AWS ETL using Lambda, MySQL, Pandas method .to_sql() - Typical execution speeds?","Hi guys, I'm copying this from a [post I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/k6zprr/lambda_durations_for_etls/) in the AWS Subreddit. The intent of my recently built ETL is for a single PowerBI dashboard be updated by multiple users from multiple locations. The current pipeline works like this:

* User uploads xlsx or csv on Amplify Webapp, connected to S3
* S3 triggers Lambda function
* Lambda function utilizes Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL Connector to transform and push data to an RDS MySQL db
* Using the df.to\_sql method and SQLAlchemy create\_engine for pushing the data to table in db
* Typical raw csv or xlsx is between 8,000 and 15,000 rows w/ 53 columns, mixed bag of variable types. Most of them are VARCHAR(50) or BIGINT
* Typical duration to run the code is around 6800ms with 233 MB memory utilization and 2048 MB allocated
* Currently running this off micro free tier instance

This is my first ETL in the AWS ecosystem and using Lambda. I'm wondering if this seems like an unusually long time to require running a Lambda function for, with my described dependencies. Perhaps there are some best practices that I have missed the boat on. I am forced to deal with the xlsx / csv native format, and I used Pandas for the initial transform and cleaning because I had already written the functions before I wrote the code for the SQL. Perhaps it just because I'm on the free tier instance. Not too sure. 

I tried what a user suggested and incrementally upped the memory from 2048, eventually hit zero returns to scale at 3072. Dropped total compute time from 6800ms to 4100ms. I also experimented by cutting out the to\_sql() line of code which dropped it from 4100ms to 2000ms. So, does it strike anyone as unusual that, given these parameters, this Pandas method is taking +/-2000 seconds to execute?

mydf.to\_sql(tableName, engine, index=False, if\_exists='replace')

Thanks guys.",1,datascience,2020-12-05
k7bdib,Need to vent! Interviewing take homes,"I completed an interview take home assignment that took about ten hours. Presentation and Jupyter notebook with my code and explanations.

k7b4uz,Question about where to start,"Hey everyone

Hope it's okay to post soliciting advice! 

Anywho.. I work in education.. have a bachelor's and masters already. Not in data science though. I use a lot of data already and pretty standard statistics, but I'm interested in expanding data collection and analysis within my role. I've taken a few free courses on data science, machine learning, and basic python.  I think there is a lot of potential for implementation in education. 

The problem is, I don't know where to start. What types of software should I use, how do I actually use machine learning algorithms? While I have some primary knowledge, I truly feel more confused than I did before I started. 

I would really appreciate any direction/guidance/advice. Thank you!",0,datascience,2020-12-05

Very quick question from a layman. I'm looking for a laptop for data science practice. I appreciate I can use cloud computing for the heavy stuff, but I'd still like something half decent if possible within my budget.

I've done a lot of research and I've decided on either getting something like the laptop linked below, or just saving my money and getting something super thin.

Any advice is greatly appreciated and thank you for your patience.

k6v9ve,Advice about moving out from Data Scientist position,"Hello!

I'm currently working as Junior Data Scientist in the headquarters of a big multinational company for almost 3 years. It is my first job since I finished my masters in Computer Science, working on a project related to Data Visualisation and Machine Learning.

During the first 2,5 years, I asked a lot my manager to join the projects related to Machine Learning, but ended up working a lot building dashboards - nothing against it, but the projects were basically migrating an Excel dashboard to a BI one, super boring. Apart from that, I have worked on a project which I needed to aggregate billions of records of a telemetry table to support stakeholders to analyse consumer usage of the appliances produced by their units - basically a Data Engineer/Software Engineer project.

However, what I and many colleagues (including my manager) noticed that I have a big talent for communications. I'm able to communicate pretty well with stakeholders, understand their requirements and translate the findings into non-technical language. Now my current work is basically connect with stakeholders, understand their problems related to data, suggest solutions and tests with proof of concepts and create roadmaps for future DS projects with my team. I enjoy very much what I'm doing now and would prefer that way more that sitting for hours developing models or solutions, with minimal communication with the stakeholders, like my colleagues Data Scientists are doing in my team.

Now I'm thinking about leaving my position of Data Scientist and have another role in which I would focus more on pre-deliverable phase of the projects. However, negotiations with my manager are not going so well as I'm struggling a bit to define my role: Is it Data Analyst, Business Analyst,...? Then what is the implications of moving out from Data Scientist position? Does it make sense to do this transition? My manager suggested that I could take a Project Manager position, but I don't feel that my profile fits with this role as I don't wanna leave entirely the development side. I would like to be this bridge between front and back office, which I can communicate with stakeholders about the problems, but still discuss about solutions in a technical way with my colleagues in my team.

Hope I'm not being so fuzzy in my text, but I can do my best to clarify any questions on comments.",2,datascience,2020-12-05

k6npmr,How relevant are complex math topics in industry,"Iâ€™m currently in a math based program and I spend time outside of school studying ML.
Most of my courses right now are focused on Real and Complex Analysis, Measure Theory, Control Theory, Abstract Algebra... etc

How often are these topics relevant in practice?
For example, Iâ€™ve been reading some papers that utilize measure theory, symmetric functions... and the implementations of these papers are used in industry.

k6m7dh,Looking for guidance on understanding if my organization is ready for machine learning,"I don't think we are, and i'm having a hard time explaining why and convincing my manager the same. I thought i'd ask for advice here from those who work for organizations that made the jump and those who work for organizations that ""thought"" they wanted ML work done and have seen negative ROI.  


I work for a healthtech company and work on the analytics team. Our team builds ETL jobs and dashboards. Nobody on our team has a background in math, statistics, CS, SE etc and nobody has ever built a production model before. I took a 12-week DS bootcamp but that only gave me like a 30,000 foot view of ML.  


We're doing our 2021 product roadmap and my director wants us to add a new feature for our customers to predict some outcomes for one of our apps. I'm trying to explain why we're not there yet, like the fact that our data infrastructure is undergoing a major overhaul and it's shaky AF, the fact that leadership won't let us hire an ML engineer but that we can ""take some of the 60 ML courses that AWS offers.  


I see posts here all the time from disgruntled data scientists and ML engineers who complain about organizations wanting that information but not investing and understanding what it is, and is not. Or spending their time on the data engineering side of things and less time training and tuning models.  


Don't get me wrong, I would love to dink around all day trying to train models. But we're not there yet in terms of data maturity. We're still in the phase of trying to understand what has happened ,never mind trying to show our customers the likelihood that specific events could happen.
