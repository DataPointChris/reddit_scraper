k5ftak,SQL Server: How to skip weekends when using DATEADD?,"Let's say a company has a project assigned on '2020-12-7' (a Monday), and they're told they have 8 days to get it done. The company doesn't work on weekends, so that means the due date isn't 7+8 (the 15th, a Tuesday), but rather the 18th (a Thursday).

The common solution I've seen is ""If it ends on a Saturday, add 2; if it ends on a Sunday, add 1."" But that only helps me if I *END* the calculation on a weekend. In the above example, the numbers are still off.

k4vem5,SQL Queries for Mere Mortals 4th Ed: Chapter 12 example problem,"All,

About a full week into SQL learning and am working through SQL Queries for Mere Mortals. I am on aggregate functions right now and am having a difficult time understanding the rationale behind a solution in the book (I am learning in T-SQL).

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is as follows:

*‚ÄúList the last name and first name, in alphabetical order, of every bowler whose personal average score is greater than or equal to the overall average score.‚Äù*

There is a Bowlers table (containing basic personal info) and a bowler\_scores table that contains score information for individual games. Both tables contain a ""BowlerID"" unique identifer number linking bowlers to games. 

The solution given is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

SELECT Bowlers.BowlerLastName,

Bowlers.BowlerFirstName

FROM Bowlers

WHERE (SELECT AVG(RawScore)

FROM Bowler\_Scores AS BS

***WHERE BS.BowlerID = Bowlers.BowlerID***)

&gt;=(SELECT AVG(RawScore) FROM Bowler\_Scores)

ORDER BY Bowlers.BowlerLastName,

¬†¬†¬†¬†Bowlers.BowlerFirstName

&amp;#x200B;

The part I don't understand is bolded. How would this result in determining whose average rawscore is higher than average?

k4pdw2,Why should you use an ORM (Object Relational Mapper)?,"Budding web developers learning [Model-View-Controller frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) are taught that they should use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to interface with their databases. But the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is often brushed aside or omitted entirely, leaving a fledgeling programmer with burning questions like ‚ÄùWhat are ORMs, anyway?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat problems do they solve?‚Äù

ORMs are a class of tools that facilitate interactions between a programming language and a relational database management system. They can range in complexity and opinionation from a simple set of abstractions for interactions with relational databases (SQLAlchemy Base) to fully opinionated tools for mapping database rows to language structs (Django ORM, SQLAlchemy ORM). To get a better understanding of how ORMs work, it‚Äôs helpful to work through the kind of problems they can solve.

This article aims to explain the use of ORMs by examining the kinds of problems they can solve and the advantages they have over alternative approaches: [https://monadical.com/posts/why-use-orm.html](https://monadical.com/posts/why-use-orm.html)",2,learnsql,2020-12-05
