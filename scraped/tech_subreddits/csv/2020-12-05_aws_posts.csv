k764ti,The simplest way to use Cognito,"Hey guys, 

I am a third-year Software Engineering student and am working on a personal project. I have limited experience with AWS but have been using react native to build a simple message board application. I'm up to the point where I need to enable authentication and authorization. I am also doing a few extra things so I'm currently using lightsail containers for web services with my goal being to incorporate Cognito as a means of allowing for social media login and to handle the overall authentication and authorization of the application. I have read the documentation and watched a few videos on Congito but I'm still struggling to understand how I can use it outside of API gateway and lambda, is it possible? If not are there any alternatives for this as I am not really confident in building an authentication system due to the possibility of sensitive information being comprised if i don't do it properly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestion such as videos or good code examples would be really appreciated.

k6zprr,Lambda Durations for ETLs,"The intent of my recently built ETL is for a single PowerBI dashboard be updated by multiple users from multiple locations. The current pipeline works like this:

* User uploads xlsx or csv on Amplify Webapp, connected to S3
* S3 triggers Lambda function
* Lambda function utilizes Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL Connector to transform and push data to an RDS MySQL db
* Typical raw csv or xlsx is between 8,000 and 15,000 rows w/ 53 columns
* Typical duration to run the code is around 6800ms with 233 MB memory utilization
* Currently running this off micro free tier instance

This is my first ETL in the AWS ecosystem and using Lambda. I'm wondering if this seems like an unusually long time to require running a Lambda function for. Perhaps there are some best practices that I have missed the boat on. I am forced to deal with the xlsx / csv native format, and I used Pandas for the initial transform and cleaning because I had already written the functions before I wrote the code for the SQL.

Also, I am using the .to\_sql method and SQLAlchemy create\_engine for pushing the data to a table in the db. \*Edit, perhaps it just because I'm on the free tier instance. Not too sure.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",1,aws,2020-12-05
k6ywoq,Help with Auto Scaling Group,"I want to have an S3 bucket where for every time a file is uploaded, a new instance is created, the instance does something and then it deletes itself.

My idea here was to have a lambda function that adds a message in an SQS queue when a new file is uploaded. The condition in the auto scaling group could be to launch a new instance when this occurs. I don’t really know the details of what this will look like but think it should be doable. If not, please let me know why.

The main problem I’m having is that when I upload an S3 file and an EC2 instance is ultimately launched, I want to be able to access that specific file from within the EC2 instance’s user data. Is there a way for me to associate the EC2 instance with the S3 file? 

Ideally, I’d just be able to include the S3 file name in the SQS message and then pass the SQS message in as a variable in the EC2 user data. Or, maybe I could have a lambda function that figures out the ID of the EC2 instance that is launched based on a given SQS message (which would contain an S3 file name), and then add a tag to the desired S3 file containing the EC2 instance ID – the EC2 instance user data could then select the desired file based on which one has the correct tag. I have no idea if either of these options is possible, but these are just ideas I came up with.

k74j6e,Can I put a billing limit somewhere that block all my services once reached?,"Hi,

I'm a dev, but just a person.  
I'm trying things on aws, last night I made a lambda triggered by a SQS queue, what I didn't knew was that if the lambda fails the message stays in the queue and will keep triggering the lambda.  


Now it was a small lambda and I caught it before going to bed.

k6yi6s,I am writing down the scope of our CI/CD pipeline to be developed using AWS native tools. What do you recommend?,"I am in the process of finalizing the scope of our CI/CD pipeline that will be using AWS native tools Codepipeline, code build, and such. The basic pipeline boilerplate is written in CDK and we love the choice so far. Now, we would like to define the final scope for it, and here's what we have got so far.

I would love to know what tools/abilities are integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that we are looking at developing an enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline.

1. Pipeline per branch  
2.  Build once, deploy many  
 3. Cross account deployment i.e Deployment to Different environments (dev/QA/prod) from tools account  
 4.  Pipeline behavior based on the branch name  
 5.  Test execution based on the stage/environment  
 6.  Integrate static code analysis  

7. Manual approval by multiple people before deployment

8.  Identifying Security code vulnerabilities in application source code from the pipeline (May be through Synk)

9.  Identifying  AWS cloud formation security tests (May be through SecurityHub)

10.  Allow developers to deploy feature branches in the common sandbox account from the CI/CD  
 11. Create dashboards for builds/deployments by sending events from the pipeline to the cloud -watch  
 12. Observe alarms when a test fails so that an automatic rollback happens in  that case   
 13.  Observe alarms when a config rule fails so that an automatic rollback happens in  that case

14.  Dynamic pipelines per branch based on events  
 15. Support pre-view deployment stage

k6x5dz,Working to understand some growing pains,"I run a small education website (maybe a half-million requests per day, I think) that's seen some significant growth recently, and I'm hoping the folks here can help me understand a few growing pains...

**First**: I've noticed that since we moved to an ALB I've been seeing some 502 errors -- maybe 15 per day at the request volume above. The errors seem to occur on random requests (they're not associated with any particular one), and I've determined that they're coming from the ELB rather than a target. Should I expect the occasional 502 error, or is this something that can be corrected?

**Second**: In trying to understand that, I plotted the total number of requests and number of 502 errors. You can find that plot [here](https://imgur.com/a/wABW7S0). The 502 errors seem to track with the request count, which is not surprising I guess. But I'm pretty sure I don't understand the request count metric. Why does this cap out at 1? Am I maxing something out, and if I am, is that related to the 502 errors?

**Third**: Posted about this earlier, but thought I'd include it as a bonus question here. In the past few days, I've seen enough disk activity on my database server that I'm going to zero volume idle time, while my SQL server isn't really seeing a remarkable amount of traffic. I've plotted what that looks like since Monday [here](https://imgur.com/a/trmcTlz), and am noticing that the peaks (which don't start at the same time) are getting broader as the week continues. Running ""top"" on the server when it's in a peak shows mysqld taking \~80% CPU. Next steps for me will be restarting the server tonight, and looking at non-peak mysqld CPU usage, but I'd welcome any other debugging tips from more experienced folks.

k6p8rp,Why would you recycle or refresh infrastructure frequently?," A question has come up and I have heard about people doing this practice of recycling (spinning up and spinning down) new infrastructure daily or multiple times per day. Is this best practice, if so why would you do it, what are the benefits?

  
Say, for example, we have a pair of web/app servers and I need to deploy a new customer onto the web/app servers - this process ordinarily involves us manually installing and configuring our software on the servers. We now have a powershell capability to do (most of) this. So would the automation simply perform the automation and run the installation etc. on both web app servers or would I recycle the infrastructure each time with a new deployment (immediate issue there I can foresee is a limited number of deployments you could do if each time it may take, say, 15 minutes to spin up).  
Or would it be the case that you might deploy those configurations multiple times per day and then recycle the servers, say, once every evening - again, if so - why?

  
And this brings me onto my last point, if I am spinning up new instances either for the recycling or perhaps an autoscaling trigger. The new web/app server that is spun up has to join the existing ""cluster"" but be aware of the configuration it requires, ie. all the customers (tenants) ""instances"" of our application on the web/app - I assume we would have to maintain some sort of centralised configuration database (DynamoDB or such like) that holds all the config for the customers so that when the server spins up it can refer to the central config and deploy all the customers on there as required?",3,aws,2020-12-05

I'm a bit bemused (and/or confused) that [the FAQ page it directs to](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#t4g-instances) for additional details says ""March 31, 2020"" everywhere.

My month-to-date bill in the Billing Management Console is also still saying ""$0.00 per On Demand Linux t4g.micro Instance hour under 750 free hours/month of t4g free trial ending Dec 31 2020"" so it seems not everything is updated yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When a problem happens, we can still lose a quarter of the whole service, but the way that customers or resources are assigned means that the scope of impact with shuffle sharding is considerably better. With eight workers, there are 28 unique combinations of two workers, which means that there are 28 possible shuffle shards. If we have hundreds or more of customers, and we assign each customer to a shuffle shard, then the scope of impact due to a problem is just 1/28th. That’s 7 times better than regular sharding.

what is the definition of impact and why is 1/28th ?

IMO,  the impact of users is 1/8, the impact of workload 2/8 =&gt; 1/4
