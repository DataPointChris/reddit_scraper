Some of that is user error, some of that is technical error, it all costs time and money to investigate.

Running stuff on your own personal computer is a whole different game to running it for a business or university. The MS licencing fees, whilst heavy, are much cheaper in bulk than buying retail.

Public cloud email services like Gmail just work. Users know that. Anything you run yourself that doesn't work as well is going to get complaints quickly. They've set the usability bar. 

Free software doesn't translate to free services. It's a lot easier and probably cheaper to just pay Microsoft to provision a few more accounts on their huge infrastructure.

geoym35,k75gr2,"Don't underestimate the tooling.

A huge benefit Microsoft have is that most of the things Group Policy can do involve configuring other Microsoft software.  

None of the Linux-based system management tools have that advantage.  So when a project decides to change how its configuration works  - which, when there's thousands of projects' worth of work going into a Linux distribution, happens all the time - that might break things.  

This makes it impossible for Puppet, chef, ansible and other configuration management tools to maintain a pre-cooked list of configuration playbooks which just need a few variables twiddled here and there to run up a configuration.  RedHat and Canonical could do this for their own distributions, but even then they'd have to reinvent the wheel all the damn time.

The problem is that LibreOffice (which is not fit for purpose anyway, but let's gloss over that) does not integrate neatly with any of them.  There isn't a Puppet or a Salt module you can easily download and use that will configure it; you've got to roll your own.

Lather, rinse and repeat for virtually every other desktop product.

gepdb8p,k75gr2,"&gt;and ms office ain't cheap anyways (except edu, gov)

Actually it is, but there's a whole separate set of issues here.

1. You are comparing the cost of software to the cost of a bag of potatoes.  Your employer, however, is paying per user and comparing it to their salary.  Which is likely several hundred times the software cost.  It is therefore not, by any stretch of the imagination, expensive.
2. To you and me, ""Free"" sounds wonderful.  To many IT managers - and for that matter staff who are given computer equipment to do their job - it sounds highly suspect.
   1. ""What's wrong with it?  Can't be that good if they have to give it away for free.""
   2. ""Look at my cheapskate employer.  They pay me however much, but they balk at spending a fraction of that on software so I can get the damn job done.  Just shows how much they really value me, I guess"".
   3. Virtually all Linux desktop applications then jump headfirst into this obvious ""can't be any good"" trap.... by not being very good.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On the other hand, everything goes to the browser anyways, so

Rather less so with email, simply because Outlook has such a stranglehold.  But that's a separate issue entirely:  You or I look at outlook and see email.

The people making the purchasing decisions don't.  

They see an integrated diary, address book, meeting room booking system and email application that all works together and integrates with their mobile phone so every little feature JFW more-or-less everywhere.  Every single one of those features is vital, and if you take away just one of those features, the result is a lot less useful. 

That's the sort of thing I mean when I say I don't know where to begin discussing issues.  The way a lot of Linux users are looking at desktop issues is so diametrically opposed to many of the people who they expect to actually use their solutions on a daily basis that it is very difficult to bridge the gap.",6.0

OSS 3 fixed that but the license was wrong, so we duplicated the effort with another half baked workaround called ALSA that took years to become functional, and still had shortcomings. Trying to use bluetooth speakers was a nightmare for instance.

Then came PulseAudio which, again, took years to somewhat work, and is now being replaced with Pipewire which is still broken and half baked.

Desktops were 90% functional, with various issues and discrepancies between the brand new GTK2 and QT3. It was starting to become functional by 2010 but then Gnome 3 came and hit the reset button, which took about 10 years to recover.

So many things appeared functional but actually were subtly broken in some way, or missing that particular feature you needed.

gepfvqz,k75gr2,"There's is an important difference though, Linux isn't beholden to others anymore and running a web browser didn't actually accomplish as much for you as it does now. Previously you were mostly dependent upon local desktop software to do most of the valuable stuff.

For the popularity thing, even if you didn't like Xorg you were just kind of stuck with it because it was either that or you just didn't have a GUI on Linux.

gep6sgu,k75gr2,"Except it's - if anything - worse today.

Twenty years ago, the F/OSS desktop world was anything from 3-5 years behind the state-of-the-art.  Hardware support was closer to 3 years; software more like 5.  (Incidentally, hardware support being 3 years behind is a monumental pain in the arse when most desktop hardware only spends 1-1.5 years on the market before it's superseded)

Today, the state of the art has moved on.  The F/OSS world has achieved in 20 years what the commercial world did in 5.  And so it isn't 3-5 years behind, it's 10-15 years behind.

Fifteen.  Years.

And people say with a straight face that Linux ""really should be on the desktop everywhere"".  

The problem with that statement is that in just one sentence, it demonstrates such a massive amount of ignorance that it's difficult to know where to start addressing the argument.  A graphic artist can't simply use Gimp in place of Photoshop, for reasons that are so long and complicated it'd be a lot easier for them simply to ignore you, head on over to [Adobe.com](https://Adobe.com), put in their credit card details and forget you ever existed.

Similarly, an enterprise IT manager is much more likely to go down the Office 365 route if he's decided he doesn't want to manage Exchange in-house than he ever is to look at F/OSS alternatives.  There are many, varied reasons for this - some technical, some political - but again, there are so many that it's basically impossible to know where to start.",7.0

In 2005 people were getting bombarded by bluescreens for no reason on Windows XP, heavy multitasking was uncommon, and security was hardly even a thing.

I'd say FOSS is more like in ""Windows 7-era"", that is ~9-10 years behind, right now, lacks all the integration and collaboration and/or cloud features, but at least most things will work without having to f**k with them for hours.

Also, the pace of technological improvement in the PC space, on both hardware and software side, was frantic 20 years ago, and has slowed down massively since then, especially in the last decade. That's especially visible with consumer hardware, a decent desktop/laptop from ~8 years ago, today would still do a decent job at office tasks, for example, whereas using an 8-year-old computer 8 years ago would be a proper pain, even for simple work. 20 years ago a 4-year old computer was about as obsolete as a 15-year old computer is now, but I digress...

Nowadays I don't have much that I long or envy from Windows or Mac, outside of the broad selection of commercial software those desktops have. Even need for them is becoming rare, because most things work on top of the browser. I can use whatever cloud service I need because it only needs a web browser really.

I used MS Office during my student years in the uni and don't remember using any ""collab features and integration"". 

It could have been true for some universities assuming that someone put a lot of time and effort to implement the infrastructure to use it. But many ""(all?)"" universities did not.

Nowadays it does not even matter, Google Docs is a de-facto standard for education, collab features and integration are coming out of the box and you don't have to carry 30-years legacy to use it. And microsoft is clearly trying to jump on the bandwagon and force people to use their cloud service, but instead those that want the cloud switch to Google Docs, those that want offline switch to Libre Office.

Microsoft's office market share dropped from almost absolute monopoly to 40% and continues dropping. Great example of how far MS Office is from ""work in this scale"" and how much people hate it if 60% of them were ready to undergo a painful process of migrating to almost incompatible Google Docs just to never deal with MS Office any more.

Yes, there would still be some fine tuning needed, but that deployment and maintenance of MS is the key, why Linux is NOT common in any corporate space.

The linux fragmentation is one of the reasons for that, and there are as much positive as negative aspects to it. With MS you get a fuckload of tools to do the management and keep everything running by being still easy to use. Same goes for the users - they know windows and office. Go away from that and - without intensive training and support - it will backfire gloriously. 

Also the integration is something else. I want to deploy the Linux for my users and lock it down hard, so a normal user can turn it on, work their stuff and turn it off. Not more, not less.

Anything else will require and end in support I need to do. Or our helpdesk.

Said mail problems you mentioned - yes, imagine not only you but a few hundred of students have the same problem. Or simply don't know the software.

You JUST said that your computer, with the ""FOSS alternatives"" couldn't work with their infrastructure the way it was set up. Well, those don't sound like alternatives to me. 

That's the thing that gets me about all this ""alternative"" buzz. If your application is not 100% seamlessly compatible with what the corporate world uses, it is NOT an alternative. If people can tell you're not using the same software as them without looking at your computer (through not being able to link to the others, file formats, etc) then YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE in the corporate world.

An alternative, in the corporate world, would be a program that slides into the corporate infrastructure, behaves the way they're expecting and no one can tell you're using anything different unless they look at your screen. If it requires throwing out their entire ecosystem, retraining everyone, etc. then it will never be seen as a true alternative.

gepbqr5,k75gr2,"I came from a very large public university (graduate and FT IT employee.)

The real lynchpin is email service. We had over 60,000 mailboxes. We were (in 2000) giving a 100MB mailbox per student, and that was a very large system (it was 30 for students and 60 for faculty when I was attending.)

At the same time Gmail is giving away 1GB. Granted, we weren’t mining the hell out of them and doing shitty things behind their back, but we were never, even as a large institution, going to be able to give every student 1GB of anything—mailbox or file dump (and I think the cloud services are even far more about 1GB at this point... I’m retired now.)

Universities get the cloud package (mail, drive, etc.) at a really low rate. Their Kerberos domain plugs right into it.

They sell their souls doing it—and I hope someone someday can prove MS or Google is using that data illegally under some application of FERPA because I am confident they are using it unethically and want to see them face massive fines (and it is even more damning at the K12 level where students are required by law to go to school, with someone like Google holding their entire K12 work product, often with their real name all over it); but it is really the only fiscal option. 

Unless the school is small and/or rather expensive (among peer institutions) and takes a very principled approach against it—and at the same time discourages unsanctioned uses of cloud services by faculty, student teams, orgs, etc.

Beyond that... we had faculty running all kinds of stuff. Macs. A few Next boxes. Lots of commercial Unix. Many flavors of Linux. It just depended on the department and their needs. We had a few that were evangelical WordPerfect users (for whatever reason I never understood.)

We got really good prices on Windows and Office internally and had ways to get students those prices. Some did run Linux, especially in CS and Engineering; but most were using standard consumer PCs or Macs (which were still Power-architecture and some were still pre-OSX at the time.) 

Admin/Operations was almost entirely Windows/Office like most other business services departments. It was harder to buy PCs without Windows than with, and most needed office to work with outside agencies. The hundred or so dollars for a Office license was worth it if they had less than 4 support hours trying to make something else work. It just wasn’t a major cost center.

Our critical systems (registrar, payroll, HR, grades) were all IBM mainframe CICS applications, and had been for decades. When I left there was a 10-year plan to get off of it and into Oracle Hr/Payroll/SIS.

It was generally assumed that papers were turned in as word docs or hard copy. Some would take PDFs. Most weren’t terribly uncooperative if OO (StarOffice then) mangled the Word export a bit, other than English 110 which was research writing where following the formatting was a big part of the coursework. We did have problems with students buying low end machines with Microsoft Works and trying to turn that in—which almost nobody had because we could buy Word at such a low price.

In many times users have been quite satisfied to the quality of FLOSS solution and ready to help developing it further. It is just naive thinking to imagine that with public funding Linux at desktop couldn't progress a lot in few years.

geps534,k75gr2,"Former University SysAdmin, Engineer, Architect here.  20+ years experience, 11 years at a mid-size university, specialize in Windows, Exchange, and Virtualization among other things.

The main answer is management, usability, support, and reliability.

Centralized management of Windows and associated platforms like Exchange for email has been around for 20 years.  It’s incredibly easy for administrators to manage and Microsoft has excellent resources available to make it easy to deploy.

Usability is top notch as everyone knows how to use Windows in a basic manner, and because of the comparatively low cost of entry vs Apple OSX, it translates well to a vast array of demographics.

Supportability is phenomenal as it’s so widely used in enterprises across the globe, so issues are usually documented, sometimes even well documented, and their support structure is amazeballs ONCE YOU GET PAST THE FIRST TIER jfc the first tier sucks usually anyhow... When time is of the essence - and time being money and money being tight at universities and in high-ed and edu overall, getting something fixed immediately is generally the key to maintaining costs.

Reliability goes hand in hand with a knowledgeable staff, and the work that Microsoft puts in to make sure that drivers for the 384749474673839373737 stupid things like scanning electron microscopes and Chinese malware-laden devices for your CompSci security research project that you want to connect to a computer remain compatible to a reasonable degree (e.g. they exist and were written for a kernel beyond Win2k and later).  One of the main reason Windows is comparatively bloated compared to your usual Ubuntu 20.04 deployment is it contains generic drivers for just about all the things you could do, and all of the code to run it all.  They also have massive logging and data analytic tools to look at said logs and figure out if they have trending issues so they can better support devices (which is what some of the phone home stuff does...).

So that’s basically it.  Also, High-Ed and actually all edu get MASSIVE discounts on Microsoft products.  My last price on Windows  Server Datacenter licensing was about $130 for what my current org pays $5100 for, if that gives you an idea.  The annual enterprise agreement for support was $50k for tons of hours, and my current org pays $1.2mil.

So yeah, there are some good reasons why it’s prevalent in the US.

That being said, Unix and Linux based devices also existed in decent numbers and we had to support a large amount of Macs.  It was a complete PITA because as good as Jamf is, it doesn’t hold a candle to the platforms for managing Windows.  

Also, another reason why Windows was more prevalent, the concept of ‘enterprise’ Macs is laughable.  Their servers sucked and were terribly designed, and they had zero native enterprise management functionality.  If there’s one piece of then ecosystem I would have loved to smack Jobs over the head with it would have been that aspect.  I get why they didn’t care, it just annoyed - and continues to annoy - me to the core that they’d be irresponsible towards that set of user population.",1.0

&gt; not a plausible excuse, other Linux distros keep pace with the changes, even BSDs do

So let's put the effort into the flatpak and make sure users on all distros can profit then.

&gt; entirely unacceptable excuse.

There is no need for any excuses unless you have a contract with the maintainer. Being able to do at most 2 builds per day is a severe obstruction to maintaining a package. You are free to offer the maintainer your Threadripper machine to help them build the package faster.

&gt; By-the-way I've solved this problem to me by ditching Chromium on Debian 10 and switching to MS Edge Dev - currently Chromium 88, no problems at all, more - it is much better than Debian built Chromium.

I'm currently using Vivaldi as my secondary browser for that reason and I'm looking into replacing it with the chromium flatpak.",3.0

Another reason its considered important is that it ensures longterm backward compatibility, especially for proprietary/abandoned apps and games that cant get recompiled against current dependencies or whose deps were already removed from repos altogether (32bit packages were the highest profile removal but the impact of these decisions is usually overshadowed by discussion about 32bit hardware).",1.0

The OS isn't the problem. Windows isn't a problem on a machine like this if you optimize services.msc &amp; run a debloating script either.

In fact, Windows 10 will continue to boot on devices with 1 core and less than 512MB RAM, which is where many of the main Linux distros (both Ubuntu &amp; Fedora main ISOs, and even some ISOs advertised for older systems [e.g. Xubuntu]) begin to fail. 

I have even seen Windows 10 running on a 96 MB RAM machine.. good luck getting most modern distros to do that, with the exception of minimal ISOs and stuff like Puppy.

Wayland has no sensible screen sharing support and XWayland apps will render blurry AF with fractional scaling. Qt apps are better in this regard, since they natively support fractional scaling at the toolkit level, but most apps aren't Qt and Plasma still has its share of rough edges in hidpi, let alone a multi screen / multi dpi setup. And even if all that were fixed, many apps still require to manually pass arguments or set the environment or another trickery to correctly run and scale in hidpi.

This is a bit of fud isn't it.  Alsa uses both dmix by default to mix everything together for output and dsnoop for inout mixing.

So you can have as many outputs and inputs at the same time as you want (unless your alsa is severely misconfigured).

geo6jbo,k6vu5k,"Not FUD, but sound on the pis is a bit weird.  The 'typical' Pi sound pipeline involved an audio mixer implemented in the closed source DSP coprocessor OS which was then exposed via the SoC's DMA/OMX pipelines as an alsa device allowing multiple-opens. Essentially similar to dmix, but it had all its own little warts and issues, and was/is difficult to debug and fix.

This was necessary on older Pis due to the comparatively low power of the CPU portion of the SoC. The DSP half of the chip is designed to deliver a significant percentage of functionality on these devices, even on Pi4s.

The closest comparison in the PC world I can think of is in the early 2000s there were a number of Yamaha DSP powered cards, as well as the Aureal Vortex series which implemented 'hardware' side mixing.

But suppose, have an system with thousand users, using the same configuration. Do you copy that thing to each or they share the system one.

Or do you make it user friendly, they access to override and set for own purpose. Transparent, to what they already have as the system user.

gemaqg8,k6npc0,"Being well experienced with both x86 and ARM64, I can say that there isn't much to it.  There are two hardware features implemented to aid in translation:

* The memory model can be configured to *total store order* which is the memory model provided by x86.  This allows the direct translation of concurrent x86 code without having to add artificial memory fences everywhere.  This is a super big point.
* ARM has recently added a handful of subtle quirky instructions to make simulating the x86 CPU flags easier.  There is one instruction to complement the carry flag and another one to set up flags after floating point operations as an x86 processor does.  There might be more instructions (atomic RMW instructions?), but they aren't really spectacular.

Emulating x86 is particularly easy because the CPUs have very similar design principles.  The SIMD units (SSE vs. NEON) have comparable feature sets and most instructions translate directly.  Both processors have flags, making it very straightforward to implement conditional jumps and stuff like that.  The ARM chip has more scalar and SIMD registers, so a fixed number of registers can be set aside for x86 emulation, making it very easy to translate code.

It's probably going to be a bit more difficult than that to translate x86 to RISC-V as RISC-V doesn't have flags and might not even support unaligned memory access.  The memory order thing is huge, too.",114.0

Yeah, it's surprising how much of the ISA was designed to take advantage of [one concept](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2016/EECS-2016-130.pdf).

One of the reasons I linked that proposal is because many of the proposed instructions would decode to multiple base ISA instructions. For example, PUSH/POP/POPRET. In addition, there are a lot of proposed addressing modes for postincrementing, shifting, and larger immediates. These all would require an additional instruction to implement in the base ISA.

That they're going to add stuff like `POPRET` only reaffirms my opinion that you need a rich instruction set with a bunch of “macros” for common instruction sequences for good performance.  Quite in contrast to what the RISC-V people always propagated.

More powerful CPU designs are made with cache usage in mind, so of course they are going to be consuming more power by default.

High clock rate means very little if there isn't a high performance memory interface to feed the CPU.  Memory latency has gotten higher and higher in the last few years and a lot of effort is spent on dealing with that.  A simple pipelined RISC design stalls all the time on memory accesses which is the main reason why the industry is moving away from that.  Just test it yourself, compare an RPi 3B (pipelined RISC) with an RPI 4B (out-of-order) and see how much faster the latter is at pretty much the same clock speed.

They say that everything is client-side encrypted and done correctly but we have no way to verify that nor any public third-party audits.

Meanwhile, Bitwarden is open source, and also says it's client side encrypted and uses zero knowledge. Now I am not personally a cryptographer so that doesn't really do anything for me because I wouldn't understand the source code I'm looking at. However it is publicly audited by a third party pretty much yearly lately. Which means i can have greater assurance that it's doing what it says it does.

Without naming names friends as well as me personally have worked in closed sourced projects (in my case not on the dev side) where a security audit absolutely isn't on the cards at any point.

I do absolutely agree with the blogpost thought, FOSS is not a guarantee that a lot of eyes will hit the code for vulnerabilities. But it makes it possible for it.

One drawback I think... is that much like say feedback from UI-people who do hard testing, is that its not exactly fun being on the receiving end of a report like that. It's the perfect sweet spot of boring, adding work and complexity to make any sense of creative lust pull the breaks hard.

Security and Privacy minded people who are always on the lookout for faults not just in code but implementations and design tend to exist in that same spot.

The only difference vs closed source is that when many people looked at it they saw how bad the codebase truly was which spawned much better projects. If it were closed, it would probably still be just as bad but you wouldn't know it.

Edit: An analogy:

A door with a dead bolt is a more potential security model than a door with no lock. The truth of that statement doesn't change just because someone didn't use the lock.

The security relies on the amount of independent reviews to find most vulnerabilities and on the skill of the developers to fix those issues properly.

Making a project open-source allows more people to potentially review the code and it allows more people to potentially fix known issues. So making a project open to review and open to request for changes is still a valid point to provide a level of security.

Evaluating the amount of vulnerabilities or the time it needs to find or potentially fix them doesn't change that. The conclusion from this research should really be that we need more developers to contribute to open-source projects or to enhance tools automating a basic review process.",3.0
