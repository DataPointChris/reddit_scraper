geoomcr,k6ud8i,"&gt; Decoupling so services can be developed independently and do one job and do it well is the point of microservices. Async communications and each microservice having its own DB is how you achieve that.

What does whether the communication is asynchronous or synchronous have to do with how independently the microservices can be developed? 

Whether or not the call is made synchronous or not, you still need the same amount of API bindnig between the two microservices: one message with the request,  one message with the response and an agreed upon protocol for exchanging these messages. Once that's fixed, neither of the two teams behind the microservices need to coordinate with the other team for anything, and there's not _more_ protocol to agree on with synchronous message exchange than with asynchronous message exchange.

Sure, with synchronous message exchange you do limit the called microservice's ability to hand the message off to some other microservice and then just forget it, with the request message and response message being handled by two different ends of a microservice chain. Still, how often does that _really_ cause any significant friction in the development of the system? That's more of a corner case (how often is a microservice-chain with separate in/out nodes the right architectural choice?) and not something that's anywhere near to being ""the point of microservices.""

ETA: Actually, let me expand on that a little. I don't want to come off as if I'm criticizing or am opposed to asynchronous calls in any way. An asynchronous messaging architecture has a lot of good sides and microservices often lend themselves very  well to such architectures. I just think it's over-egging the pudding to say that ""if it's not asynchronous, it's not microservices."" The point of microservices is as much if not more to decouple development teams and deployment concerns  as it is about the actual _technical_ interactions. It's not like it's in any way impossible to write a distributed monolith with asynchronous message passing between the elements, after all.",6.0
geph5ax,k6ud8i,"I think what is getting lost in the weeds here is that in microservice architecture there is simply _no need_ for synchronous communications. You should never have the need for request/response between your microservices. If you do the problem domain hasn’t been split up correctly. Each service has the data they need in their own database. They get this data and keep it in sync (eventual consistency) by listening for asynchronous events from other services.

Not all apps are suitable for this architecture and “monolith” shouldn’t be seen as a bad word. Some apps are just better suited as a monolith.

If a monolith has been split up into microservices and there is synchronous communication between them then this is a giant step backwards. There is no getting around this and no one could possibly argue otherwise with a straight face.",2.0
geplp79,k6ud8i,"&gt; I think what is getting lost in the weeds here is that in microservice architecture there is simply no need for synchronous communications. You should never have the need for request/response between your microservices.

Even within an architecture that's based on microservices and eventual consistency, there might crop up 'nodules' where a synchronous request-response might just be a better mental fit to the problem space. Like, say, the system is about to make a payment through to an external system, and the business rules state that in order to make a payment you have to log the payment in an audit log, and the payment itself must include a reference to the audit log statement. Well, you need to send a message to the audit log _and_ you need to get the audit log reference for that message _before_ you can do anything more. Sure, it's _possible_ to do this in an asynchronous manner, but would you really want to? Doesn't a synchronous message exchange with request - response just seem the natural mental model for situations like this?",1.0

Like most things in life, it isn't black and white. Sure in an ideal world you could have a totally decoupled, event driven architecture  with no blocking calls at all, but we live in the real world.

There are consequences for our design decisions, and one big cost is complexity. This is the trade off we must always balance as software architects. We need to be pragmatic with every decision we make, not just follow what I call BOA (blog-oriented-architecture). I've seen companies go under due to the big dog trying to make the perfect system.

I also built a great microservice platform that handled thousands of requests a second (with some calls between services being blocking).

It is a pity that a lot of the virtual thread behavior needs to be explicitly invoked, so that we can benefit from it, and not all threads can be simply virtual starting from whenever Loom is merged.

gempddc,k6gnyh,"I'll one up this.

A big issue with the CompletableFutures API is that while they cover 90% of scenarios, there's a 10% that causes them to be pretty awkward to work with.

Take, for example, conditional logic.  Let's say you want to eagerly load 2 values, with a third value that is also eagerly loaded to determine which of the two to use.

While it is possible to construct such a monstrosity with completable futures, it is really difficult and ends up looking pretty ugly.  This is a case where async/await style logic ends up being a whole lot cleaner than CompletableFutures (And I imagine loom will be similarly cleaner as you can simply join the 3rd task and cancel the future that doesn't apply).

You could technically do the same thing without loom, however, you'd run the real risk that in the wrong circumstance you'll end up exhausting your current thread pool leading to a pool starvation issue.  The ""right"" way to do that using the same logic is with ManagedBlockers to grow the underlying pool as needed.  Unfortunately, that only works if the current thread is on a forkjoin pool.  If it isn't, you are potentially SOL.

Then, of course, there is all the problems of getting ExecutorServices wired and setup properly throughout an application.

geleylu,k66img,"Your project structure should at least have the source under ""src"", and at least an Ant build file to be able to easily build it when checking it out (wait for it, any moment somebody will show up and tell me that I'm stupid for suggesting Ant and that you should use Maven). Having said that, you could also use Maven, however, I loathe the longer build times of it for simple projects.

---

Having said that, your should put your classes into a package, like ""com.github.clairebearz32bit.xkcdapp"".

---

Personally, I like to have the `main` method in a separate class `Main`. That makes it very easy to spot where your application starts.

---

    final String title = ""Java xkcd Client - v0.0.1"";

Methods, members and classes without an access modifier are by default `package-private`. I'd strongly advised against using `package-private` because it limits visibility to the current package only, which easily leads to an unhealthy coupling of classes. Make them `private`, `protected` or `public`.

---

Your names are good, I like that, though, they could be slightly better. With the exception of ""n"", which oddly enough is the only thing without a proper name. Also ""setImg"", don't shorten names just because you can, it does buy you nothing except makes the source slightly harder to read.

---

Your members are all `public`, they should at least be `protected` or `private` and if you need to expose some of them, expose them as functionality through methods.

---

The difference between `int` and `Integer` is that one of them is a primitive data type (pass by value) and the other is a class (pass by reference). Converting between them is called [boxing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html).

The most important difference between the two is, that the later adds to the garbage your application creates, as it is a class instance that must be cleaned up at some point. If possible,  use the primitive type and try to convert as little as possible between them.

---

In `setKeybindings` you are not using the comic number you saved previously, but instead parse the test of the textfield.

---

In `setComicScale` you're not using lambdas.

---

You could use method references instead of lambdas, personally I prefer that. For example:

    quitItem.setOnAction(this::onQuit);
    
    // ...
    
    comicNumber.setOnKeyPressed(this::onComicNumverKeyPressed);

    // ...
    
    private void onComicNumberKeyPressed(KeyEvent event) {
        if(key == KeyCode.UP) {
            showNextComic();
        } else if (key == KeyCode.DOWN) {
            showPreviousComic();
        }
    }

 &gt; 
 &gt; I take it that with Swing or JavaFX on Java 8 it's possible to build one package that works everywhere, even on platforms that not exist yet? Right?

With Swing you can always build a jar that just works everywhere (unless Swing is dropped from the JRE, which is so not going to happen within the next 15 years). So when the JRE is ported to a new platform, it would simply work there. Java 8 was the first and only release which included JavaFX, which meant that you could also simply build a jar with a JavaFX application that ran everywhere. Of course, given that I use ""JRE"" I might already be behind the current state.

The story of JavaFX is kinda sad. It started out as scripting thingy, then became what it is today. Then it was included in Java 8 because people said that it would be better to have it in the JRE package and release cycle, and it was handled as Swing replacement. Then it was removed with Java 9 because people said it would be better to have it as its own package with its own release cycle. Then it was dropped by Oracle (officially, of course, it was ""donated to the community""). Now I believe Gluon are pretty much the only once doing much work on it, and last time I checked, they majorly wanted it for mobile...but I might be wrong there, has been some time. Additionally, the JavaFX default components are not that impressive compared to the Swing ones. The whole idea of ""JavaFX will replace Swing"" is also completely laughable at this point, because that move was completely screwed up.

 &gt; You would help me learn a ton if you could share some links to the source code of one specific Swing or JavaFX on Java 8 application I could download. Please?

Uh...I don't use any JavaFX application regularly (quite a few Swing ones, though). But what you could whip up rather fast is a simple Hello World application (a window with a label would suffice) in Swing and JavaFX and then see what it takes to build and get them to run somewhere.

And yes, it irks me the wrong way that we are moving from jars, that just works everywhere, to builds for certain platforms that only work there. It is a step backwards.",2.0

If you do decide to use ant (or Maven/Gradle) you can make bundling the dependencies easier by building a 'fat' or 'uber' jar - [ant instructions](https://mkyong.com/ant/ant-create-a-fat-jar-file/), Maven/Gradle tutorials should be easy to find.

Also if you do prefer the method reference syntax over lambdas, consider taking a look at [Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) if you're not already - it will highlight lambdas that can be converted to method references and give you the option to automatically convert them.

BTW in your README it would be good to note with which Java versions your code is compatible if you know this, or at least with which Java version you successfully build the project. 

Not sure if it was mentioned, but xkcdApp should _really_ be XkcdApp since it's a class. It's really strange in Java to have a class name beginning with a lower case letter, even if it is usually stylized that way. That's quite a picky point to make though.",1.0

gejsipc,k65q2w,"I think Vavr is quite good - but I don't think the article is very good and also not suitable to show the advantages of `Either`.

Apart from the first example, none of the examples shows how to handle errors - and without error handling, all examples would be much shorter and easier to implement in ""normal Java"".

For example calculating the average would be much shorter and more readable in normal Java:

```java
double average = service.streamStudents(""ART101"")
    .mapToDouble(Student::getGpa)
    .average()
    .orElse(0.0);
```

Additionally, in case of an error, you would also see a stack trace, not just `NoSuchElementException: get() on Left`.


----


&gt; Imagine, that in future, the technical design will require the FileReadService to determine also other error cases. The number of catch clauses with increase… […]
&gt; This style helps you not only to eliminate try-catch blocks, but also to specify a single entry point for all errors […]

If all errors have to be treated the same way, also a simple catch is a single ""entry point"".
More catch-clauses are only needed if different errors have to be treated differently - in this case, however, the implementation with `Either` also becomes much more complex. A simple `getOrElse` only works if the type of error doesn't matter, and the same is possible with a `catch (Exception e)`.

`Either` is nice, but the number of possible exceptions is not really a good argument.

----

&gt; I sticked with BigDecimal, as I don’t like doubles, and actually it is a good design practice to avoid them in precise computations.

""precise computations"" like calculating an average GPA?
And then just wrapping a `double` and setting the precision to 2, so that it is significantly less accurate than `double`?

Sure, `BigDecimal` has its value, but the vast majority of calculations do not need this precision.",4.0

We switched over to springdoc recently and haven’t noticed any issues for our use case",11.0
gei8byi,k5vvfr,"&gt; Why not contribute to either springfox or springdoc?

I was pleased by springdoc initially, after a pretty disappointing springfox experience, and so I started to use springdoc. Unfortunately, it did not consistently handle ApiResponses on abstract controllers, among other minor annoyances. I've contributed some PRs to springdoc initially and wanted to make it suit my use cases, [see here](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aneiser)

After diving into the source code I also discovered springdoc internally builds upon swagger-core routines. Those algorithms are severely flawed when more sophisticated Schema building cases are tested (see ComplexDto example below). This feature is IMHO crucial to build proper frontend clients from the OpenApi spec (our main use case).

It was also just a fun project, and I hope it serves others equally well. I just couldn't see initially that the springdoc maintainer(s) and me were aligned enough that I could turn springdoc into the library I've always wanted.

Just to show off some features of the library which is IMHO not so easy to do in springdoc or springfox (implemented as integration tests):

* [See how ComplexDto is referencing itself, but with different description for the nested property](https://github.com/qaware/openapi-generator-for-spring/blob/master/openapi-generator-for-spring-test/src/test/java/de/qaware/openapigeneratorforspring/test/app5/App5Controller.java#L91) and the [resulting spec with multiple ComplexDto schemas](https://github.com/qaware/openapi-generator-for-spring/blob/master/openapi-generator-for-spring-test/src/test/resources/openApiJson/app5.json#L164) (due to different descriptions)

* Exception analysis of handler methods, see [How To entry](https://github.com/qaware/openapi-generator-for-spring#how-to-handle-error-responses-elegantly)

* [Content negotiation is supported](https://github.com/qaware/openapi-generator-for-spring/blob/master/openapi-generator-for-spring-test/src/test/java/de/qaware/openapigeneratorforspring/test/app30/App30Controller.java) within the limits of the OpenApi spec (parameters are shared among operations unfortunately)

* Almost everything is a `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` and can be overriden by you. That makes it hopefully easy to patch how the spec is generated in any fashion I can think of.

I hope that teases enough to give it a try. I'm curious how many bugs I havn't found yet.

You can produce N+1 problems with any JDBC based application. E.g. when you write your own ORM. Or even with plain JDBC:

```sql

try (Statement s1 = c.createStatement();

There are a lot of workplaces with a  culture that discourages people from admitting they don't know everything. Places where having gaps in your knowledge is seen as a weakness as opposed to an opportunity to learn something new everyday.

That kind of culture breeds a palpable amount of arrogance in devs of every skill level.

a) its maximum, not minimum

b) it says concurrency, not parallelism

Concurrency means that multiple tasks can make progress at the same time and not one has to finish before the other in sequence - they can be executed simultanously, but don't have to. E.g. one half of a task can be excuted, then a third of another and so on. While in parallelism they are truely executed simultanously, if you have the hardware (number of cores). If you have 10 running threads but only 8 cores, 2 of the 10 threads would actually have to wait until the scheduler frees a core by suspending another.

Thats why you will not see so many threads.

&gt; Am from India

The majority of people commenting in this post don't know how the Java dev candidate selection process works in India. I don't. Can you fill us in? TIA.

In the U.S., a Java cert  won't *get you a job*; per se. Nobody will hire you based ***solely*** on the fact that you got 100 on a Java cert exam.

The best a Java dev in the U.S. could probably hope for is that having a cert ***might*** be a tiebreaker in certain situations. A U.S. hiring manager, faced with a dilemma of choosing between shortlisting the resumes of two equally-qualified devs, ***might*** choose the resume of the dev with the Java cert.

I emphasized ***might*** because which dev's resume a given hiring manager goes with, would depend on their opinion of Java certs. If it happens to be a hiring manager who themselves took a Java cert exam and failed, then they are bound to be hostile against a dev who passed a Java cert. ^&amp;nbsp;^see&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;comments

That hiring manager will not put your resume in her shortlist.

If you're lucky, the tie-breaking decision would be made by a hiring manager who took the Java cert exam and passed it. In that case your application is more *likely* to proceed to the telephone interview stage of the process. But still not guaranteed. Your cert ***might*** get your foot in the door. But the cert by itself won't *get you hired*.

In the U.S. you would still have to [*run the gauntlet*](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cllcou/you_will_randomly_bomb_technical_interviews/) of telephone interviews, LeetCode-style online technical exams, algorithm white boarding interviews in front of three-four interviewers, HR interviews, the whole nine yards.
