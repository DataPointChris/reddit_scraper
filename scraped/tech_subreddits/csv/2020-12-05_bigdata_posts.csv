k70t7t,Need help connecting to a hive sink with metadata in mysql,"I am having issues connecting to the hive metastore using a hive sink.

Here is how the metadata is configured in the hive-site.xml

&lt;property&gt;    


&lt;name&gt;javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL&lt;/name&gt;

&lt;value&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost/metastore?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&lt;/value&gt;

&lt;description&gt;metadata is stored in a MySQL server&lt;/description&gt;

&lt;/property&gt;    


&amp;#x200B;

What do i set the metastore property for the hive sink when preparing the flume config file?

conf file:

...

agent1.sinks.sink-hive.type = hive

agent1.sinks.sink-hive.hive.metastore  = ???

...

&amp;#x200B;

I searched in my sql and it returned  this as the uri and tried passing it in but it doesnt work:

javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=jdbc:mysql://localhost/metastore?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true",0,bigdata,2020-12-05

k5xszv,"mahout ""clusterdump"" explained?","Hi there,

I imagine this is quite a long shot but I'm currently in the process of using mahout (hating it). I'm clustering a bunch of text documents (tf-idf vector models) using cosine distance measure.

I just cannot understand what the purpose is of specifying the distance measure when running the very last step, which in my case is clusterdump.

I specified the distance measure as cosine during the actual kmeans step/s. If I do not specify the distance measure for clusterdump it defaults to squared euclidean. But then, in my mind, the kmeans clustering process has already been done and clusterdump is just about spewing out the results in a text file.

The worrying this is, depending on whether i specify clusterdump to use cosine or euclidean or otherwise, the final outputs are very different.

&amp;#x200B;

Come to think of it, the results always feel pretty random to me - with no clear evidence that changing any of my hyperparameters (E.g. k value) is making anything consistently better or worse.

&amp;#x200B;

any advice on , specifically, the interaction between distance measure and clusterdump would be greatly appreciated.",2,bigdata,2020-12-05
