k6xv6x,Adding more data-types into &lt;tr&gt;,"I have been looking around online but can't seem to find the right answer to this. I have a filterable table that uses javascript and &lt;tr&gt; looks like this &lt;tr data-type=""fish""&gt;. I want to create a similar script but with different filtering options. The question I cannot find the answer to is whether it's possible to add another data-type into &lt;tr&gt;? 

I tried &lt;tr data-type=""fish, dog""&gt; and &lt;tr data-type=""fish"" ""dog""&gt; but those were just guess hoping they would work. 

Hopefully this question makes sense and I appreciate any help!

k6kzwq,Pulling a transcript from a video?,"
Hi there!

I'm learning Danish, and long story short, in Denmark they have a Julekalender every December - basically, a TV series told over the month with installments every day.

As I am nowhere near fluent in Danish, I have been using an inline translator and pausing the video every 5 seconds to translate. It works, but it's slow and kinda laggy.

I have been exploring the code on their video player, and I can find the current text on the screen, but I know they have to be pulled from somewhere. Basically, I just want to pull the entire transcript of the captions, so I can have a translation to refer to while watching instead of doing it manually.

I'm pretty sure it can be done, I just need someone more versed in HTML to help me locate it. (I have some background in HTML, but it's been a while and this is a little over my head).

Any help would be wonderful.
Here's a link to the first episode that I'm trying to get the captions from: https://www.dr.dk/drtv/se/julefeber_221313

Mange tak (thank you very much) in advance!

ETA: Here is the line from the code that displays the text. When the current text on the screen switches, it disappears.
&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); position: relative; inset: 0px; display: inline; writing-mode: horizontal-tb; unicode-bidi: plaintext;""&gt; Nej, nej, nej.&lt;/div&gt;",5,html,2020-12-05
