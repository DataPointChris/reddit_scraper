geozb3g,k76lal,"There are browser plugins that let you run whatever arbitrary CSS you want. Just combine that with a font-family rule that has !important.

geosn5g,k71mds,Yes. But the question was about removing the blue effect and this will serve the cause. If OP cares about efficiency he would apply it only to the relevant class,2

gepd7fr,k71mds,This might be an issue with your markup. Are you nesting clickable elements?,1
geo6yyi,k716d9,I'm guessing that your JS is both removing and adding their visibility. It should only be handling the latter. The elements being animated should be rendered with a class that makes them hidden and offset. The JS should only remove that class.,1
geobays,k716d9,"I'm using Elementor, so I'm not sure what it's doing really.  It does look like if you've visited the page, a refresh does things correctly.  But the first time you go to the page it reveals the text before doing the animation fade-in.

The only instance of something ""visible"" was the about us div, which doesn't fix the problem if I change it to ""hidden"".  The rest of the stuff is also marked ""visible"" but I can't easily edit it.  I'd have to figure out where it is in the theme/elementor files.",1

gem4k7f,k6nnuk,"Sorry dude, I can't recreate this. Need more info. Do you have fixed widths send on columns? I'm assuming your table data is being generated from a server response so you can't use `nth-child` without JS intervention?

If it helps, anchor tags are by default set to inline. Maybe changing it to `display:block` has some effect?",1
gemey9q,k6nnuk,"I tried this, but then my `a` tags were displayed underneath the `img` tag. 

`nth-child` seems to be the way to go here as I can target the columns where this is an issue. Thought it may be possible to solve with just one piece of CSS. `td img ~ a` did solve it in some areas but created issues in others. 

Appreciate you taking the time to help out, thanks.",1
gem867h,k6nnuk,"Whitespace property only affect inline elements, taking either the image or the anchor tag out of the inline flow will achieve what you want.

`td &gt; img {display:block}`, `td &gt; img + a {display:block}` or `td &gt; img + a {float:left}` will all work.",1
geocn6u,k6nnuk,"You can't do this in contemporary CSS, but it's trivial in JS.

    [... document.getElementsByTagName('td')].filter(td =&gt;
        [... td.getElementsByTagName('img')].length &gt; 1 &amp;&amp;
        [... td.getElementsByTagName('a')].length &gt; 1

Use that to attach a class name

        [... td.getElementsByTagName('a')].length &gt; 1

Now you can just hook the class `.hasBoth`",1
gelxmbj,k6nnuk,"There are a few different ways of looking at it and not all are purely CSS based.

1. If some of the table cells are special, they can be indicated by a class name in the markup. That's not exactly necessary, but it does arguably most accurately reflect what you're saying: ""These cells are different.""
2. If your structure is absolutely sure to be exactly as reflected, then you could target the `a` with something like `td &gt; img + td &gt; a`. That'll only style an `a` that comes immediately after an `img` within the same parent `td`.
3. If each table has a specific column that you want to give the same treatment, you could pick a default for the `nth-child` approach and stick a class name on any table that differs. That might be `td:nth-child(3) { ... }` and `.special-column-4 td:nth-child(4) { ... }`.
4. You may also want to take a closer look at the need for padding. Without an example, it's impossible to tell exactly what you're going for and what an alternative may look like, but it sounds a bit like you're thinking of this as the only way to do exactly what you're after. It could be worth taking a step back and trying to figure out if there's an alternate way of achieving the result you need that might be a bit more elegant, just by letting the contents flow within their cell.",1
geme3w9,k6nnuk,"I had some initial success with `td img ~ a` but then ran into some problems elsewhere on the site with `td`s that had `span` after the `img` and `a` tags. 

I think the solution here is for me to use `nth-child` on the columns I'm having this issue with. I was initially trying to see if I could solve the issue with a single piece of CSS code.

gelva2p,k6nb89,"CSS frameworks are basically developed to help those developers who don't want to spend much of their time on developing design and converting it to CSS.

You can import any CSS framework in your project using a single script tag and start using it. If you check the documentation of any framework, they'll have predefined classes that you can apply on HTML elements.

Each CSS framework have a design system that they follow. For eg: use Material.io if you want to make a UI similar to Google's products. Tailwind is relatively a new framework that has become popular in past 1-2 years among developers.

However, it's up to you if you want to develop your project using pure css or using a framework over it. I would recommend making projects using pure CSS for a beginner.",3

gekuvqx,k6he53,"You can't change/add/remove HTML elements using CSS. For this purpose you'll have to use JavaScript with its *innerHTML* property for example (and for simple changes, well, it's not hard).

However, depending of what you're looking for, you may achieve something with CSS only. If you want some content to appear only on hover, you can include this content in your HTML, and then show it only on hover, with CSS properties like display, visibility, opacity, whatever suits your goal.

What do you have in mind?",2

gekk5ew,k6dkav,"To answer your main question, yes it's very common that a flex item can also be a flex container.

Take a look at the first example found here: [Nested Flex Containers with Flexbox](https://www.quackit.com/css/flexbox/tutorial/nested_flex_containers.cfm) it's doing the same thing, but in a lot less convoluted manner than the example you're working  with, w/o the excess html structure and pretenses of creating a table or grid structure. Chances are, if you're doing something like that it could be better achieved with CSS Grid anyway - which was actually made for 2-dimensional web layouts. Flex is one-dimensional, and can only flow in one direction at a time, which is why you would nest containers. The main container in both examples has the default flex-direction of row like we read, left to right. Say you have 3 divs or ""columns"" inside that container, and you want them each to have a vertical card layout, so up and down, you can make those divs display: flex and also give them a rule of flex-direction: column. So your main divs are layed out on the main horizontal axis of flex, while the content of those divs goes from top to bottom like you want, and since they are already flex containers you can use all the other flex properties to control this card layout as well.",3
geksnoz,k6dkav,"Oh, I see. Now it makes sense. I had no idea it worked like that. It seemed at the time like there were too many flex containers.

gejhpcw,k5yduz,Top border and border radius can do that I think,2
gejvdc8,k5yduz,"In order to get their appearance, probably the easiest approach is:

1. Use `border-radius` to achieve the rounding
1. Use a background gradient to get the 2-band color (you don't want to use an actual border because you won't get the flat cut bottom)
1. A stop at 0, a stop at 4-or-so, a second stop at 4-or-so, and a stop at 100 should do.

So:

    div#foo { 
      background: black;
      background: linear-gradient(180deg, 
        rgba(23,235,47,1) 0%, 
        rgba(23,235,47,1) 6px, 
        rgba(191,191,191,1) 6px, 
        rgba(191,191,191,1) 100%
      );
      border-radius: 6px;

    &lt;div id=""foo""&gt;
      lorem ipsum&lt;br/&gt;dolor sit amet

I expected a different outcome, because I'm used to the border being smaller than the cut, which would make sort of a downwards half-circle looking thing

But when it's the exact same size as the cut and there's only a top, the corner algorithm ends up losing the circle entirely.

Short answer?  ***I was wrong***.  You're right, that's a better approach.

The entire reason I was using the background was to get away from a subtle error that doesn't actually exist.",1
gekfigy,k5yduz,Yes that's can be done easily. You can use div elements or just nav with ul menu and style your items as you want. For images you can make yours as svg or using ready icons.,1
