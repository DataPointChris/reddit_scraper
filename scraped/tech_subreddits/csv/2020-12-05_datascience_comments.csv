geptciz,k7azmq,Thanks for the tip! I already started with python through solo learn and udemy. Hoping to at least become familiar with syntax and knock out some guided projects on my own.

gepaexz,k77zuv,"Do them only if they are free or someone sponsors you e.g. a library/school/employer.

These courses are not very good and even if they were, employers don't value them as much as you think. The names of big universities linked to these courses mean nothing.

Python4Everybody is offered free of cost online by the same instructor.

The excel course (I took that) teaches pivot tables, charts, lookup functions and formulae. It doesn't teach VBA and macros. You can probably finish the whole course within a couple of days. I haven't taken the entire specialization but i believe the courses are good.

For SQL and Tableau, I would suggest looking towards other alternatives.

Learn by doing is the best thing I can suggest. Learn enough through YouTube, Medium articles and tutorials and build small projects.

Good Luck!",2

gen7jy9,k6v9ve,"Sounds like you're interested in a Product Manager-like position for the data science team. PMs are typically not coding at all (or very little if they have the background, more querying than building) and manage the stakeholder needs and prioritization in order to deliver analysis or tooling or models.

""Not a lot of those positions out there, to be fair, but that role would be incredibly valuable to the right company.""

geoj6c1,k6v9ve,"He said I can take a Project Manager role, not Product Manager, replacing one of my colleagues who will leave. Product Manager seems interesting but Project Manager seems boring to me.

genzjpf,k6v9ve,"&gt; connect with stakeholders, understand their problems related to data, suggest solutions and tests with proof of concepts and create roadmaps for future DS projects

Assuming you're building the proofs of concepts yourself and creating data science products, I'd say that this potentially all falls under the remit of a data scientist, especially at a smaller company. The business has a problem, a data scientist talks with stakeholders to understand the problem, suggests a solution, then builds, tests and implements it. Some companies might have additional steps or layers in there so the data scientist ends up further away from the stakeholders but plenty of companies have data scientists disscussing problems directly with stakeholders.

If you don't want to actually be doing the data science work then you effectively want to be one of those layers that sits between the data scientists and the stakeholders.",3
geoix2n,k6v9ve,"And what could be a position in this layer between DS and stakeholders? I work in a big company and my team is quite big, hence this pressure to structure better the roles.

gen53l4,k6t3g7,"Yes we call it documentation. It‚Äôs a formal write up of the work and model build process. Define the project and motivation. Actions taken and justification for the action. Document variable transformations and treatment to variables. All that stuff we formally write up.

As a rule, I want to be able to run my pipeline script from scratch, from accessing raw data, through all of the steps to completion, and get the same result (given same raw data), whenever I want.

gene4c5,k6t3g7,"I‚Äôve heard this referred to as ‚Äúdata lineage‚Äù ‚Äî- you want to know exactly the steps that happened between your input data and whatever your output is. This is an area that‚Äôs still maturing, so I doubt you‚Äôll find a 100% perfect fit for your use-case, but there are some tools that might get you part-way.

For Python, `sklearn` *pipelines* are kind of a solution, since they list a series of steps that your data goes through. The final step can even be fitting a model. Each transformer has fit and transform methods, but you can use an empty fit method for stateless transformers.

On the R side of things, the `recipes` package lists preprocessing steps. You can even give your steps manual descriptions to keep track of what‚Äôs going on. Alternatively, the `tidylog` package patches common `dplyr` verbs to automatically print information about the transformations.

If you actually want to capture the results of intermediate steps, and not just descriptions of what the code is doing, consider looking into *Metaflow*. This is an open-source tool from Netflix that breaks processes into steps, with the results of each step captured on S3. It has bindings for both R and Python.

The simplest solution is to add some logging to your code if you haven‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs surprising how little logging there is in data science code, but I consider it mandatory for any serious project.",1
genqclk,k6t3g7,"Beside the tools already mentioned in other answers, take a look at solutions for reproducible research.  However, I've found that the existing tools most often come handy when working on larger projects and established pipelines close to production, less in the research/experimentation phase in practice, as the pace and number of branches explored are high and there are lots of details to keep track of. 

But despite the tools, what really makes a difference is having the culture and allocating time for doing this one way or another. Once the goal and value documentation is clear, you can even get things rolling with basic tools/setups for (1) capturing the main questions/ideas, lessons learned and choices made in modelling, and (2) a visual overview of the key steps in the modelling pipeline as some sort of graph. While automation and tools help with efficiency, taking time to create or at least review these documents is precious for both reflection on the work done as well as posterity.",1
gepdbk8,k6t3g7,"Look into kedro or MLflow.

Also parameterize your experiments using YAML/JSON, save artifacts in time stamped folders for each run with all the parameters, random seeds, logging output etc.

Verbose logging helps as well to document exactly what's going on. Use python logging module.",1
gem59jw,k6npmr,"As a general guide:

1. Academics vastly overestimate how applicable their work is to industry.
2. Practicioners vastly overestimate how complex their models are.

With all that said: yes, there are companies where their data scientists are using math that is incredibly complex - maybe more so than what you're learning because they're wrinkles specific to their industry that requires what is essentially research work.

However, those are going to be the vast minority. The majority of data science jobs aren't measured on the complexity of the models they use, but rather their ability to generate ROI. And really complex math is seldom the best path to good ROI (because the I is really high). 

Having said that, what I've found is that someone that has more in-depth experience with math is more likely, at some point in their career, to flex a *little*  bit harder than colleagues who don't, and sometimes that little bit is enough to make a big, big difference.",10
gelx8kn,k6npmr,"Obligatory caveat that the responses that you get on this will vary from responder to responder based on the particulars of their experience. That said, in my experience these types of courses are not at all *directly relevant*; that said I don‚Äôt have any regret about taking such courses as part of my undergraduate education. They often are required classes ofc and trying to excel at your degree experience is a good thing.  In addition one can make the whole ‚Äòlearning and practicing how to think analytically is a good thing‚Äô argument.

gemln7z,k6npmr,"It's going to be a small minority of data science work that go deep into these topics. Consider this: 

(1)  there's really not much time or reason (value) to develop new tools in a large majority of the cases. Except in a few large corporations data scientists are not advancing the sate of the art in a major way in terms of algorithms and methods. They're busy applying the tools in solving problems, which itself poses good challenges. 

(2) You need certainty and reliability in practical applications, which means you want to minimize relying on your custom code and solutions. Specially for complex topics. If it's something only a few people understand, it's risky to rely on a home made solution by one of your data scientists in a critical product/solution. Also, if only a few understand that topic, it's a big liability to count on one person in your team to know it; bus factor risks alone make it undesirable.",2

gent0q2,k6npmr,"It's not so much how relevant each individual class will be; it's how much those classes contribute to a deeper understanding of math. That deeper understanding of math will be helpful.

For a lot of ML tasks, the most powerful tool at the data scientist's disposal is the ability to create a custom metric to minimize/maximize. A deeper understanding of mathematics can help one make sure their ML model identifies the best model based on criteria equivalent to what the business would use if they were evaluating outcomes manually.",1

gem6056,k6m7dh,"This is something that data scientists tend to struggle with, but really need to improve on.

You are being asked to do something and your approach is ""no, because"", when instead you should be answering ""yes, but"". 

There are always going to be a million reasons why you shouldn't do something. It's hard, you're not ready, you don't have the data, etc, etc, etc.

So if the request is ""let's build a model that does X"", and your response is ""we can't"" *and you stop there*, then you're limiting yourself and your company.

Instead, ask yourself what you *can* do.

Or let me put this differently: if someone kidnapped your parents and said ""add a new feature for our customers to predict some outcomes for one of our apps or we kill your parents"", what would you do?

Ok, now go and do *that*, and then work with your boss up front to establish what you will need, what are going to be the limitations, what are the things you don't know yet, etc.

gemn040,k6m7dh,"Perhaps you can approach the situation differently. Machine learning is jut another tool you can use to solve problems. Using it doesn't need to be a huge decision and a great commitment, at least in the beginning and until there's reason for that. Like other problems in the presence of uncertainty, you can approach it in iterations: take a small step, learn/evaluate, and repeat if it shows promise. Start with a small project, time-box it, and get some first results. You'll learn about the challenges, but also about the promise. Now you'll have more information and can decide better how to proceed: is there really room for ML in your org or is it too early, you'll have evidence and experiments instead of others' stories and complaints.",1

gel5zmc,k6icwu,"I think an important thing to bear in mind is that you don't neglect the soft-skills elements of DS when self studying. Part of the advantage of a formal education is that you go through it with other people. You're therefore able to discuss/argue/explore ideas and develop good scientific communication skills along with the critical thinking faculties developed through debate and discussion.

This is of course harder to achieve by yourself, certainly it's hard to develop these skills in a new field by purely working through solo project after solo project.

geoh26y,k6icwu,"Uni is more about how to learn, think, find information, solve problems &amp; get shit done, etc than it is about what you learn - which in my experience is often out of date and most is of little relevance (especially when most lecturers don't give a shit about teaching, they only do it on the side of their research).

You are proving you can stick to something for 3-5 years and navigate or adapt your way through a system without anyone holding your hand. - to graduate with piece of paper or two (obviously some degrees are more valuable and necessary than others).

You also make the beginnings of a network and develop some professional and social skills which are important especially early in your career (but this experience is less and less of a thing, especially post grad and external / online study) but once you get out in the real world - what you do there... practically - far outweighs anything you did or learnt at uni. You also now have much more easier ways of connecting with a far larger and more diverse group of people online.

There is a limit to the benefit of time spent learning in formal institutions - to a large degree (pun intended) you are paying a huge amount of money (not to mention time) to effectively self learn for a large part anyway.

You just pair it with the math/stats so you can effectively model things with your software.

There are really two rough kinds of data scientist. The majority of them are specialist software engineers, like algorithm developers at old school engineering firms, but some firms employ them more like a team of research scientists.

The research scientist variety would be doing work more like a ""data analyst"" however they usually have a lot of scientific domain expertise they bring to the table. Those roles I've seen often require a PhD. They will say an MS is acceptable but a PhD that didn't make it in academia will apply and probably take the role.

geomaqh,k6icwu," I have an MS Physics and an undergrad Mechanical Engineering degree, I caught hold of a good Data Scientist role where I work on DL models, highly complex RL problems, do some research engineering,  with in-depth exposure to fields like CV/NLP as projects would keep rotating (it's a service based company, but also building AI products, so everything under the sun actually if I stay for 2+ years). 

I wish to go for an MS in DS after a couple years of experience. This is mainly to change geography and gain international experience, and to set base with good education in the field I'd probably be pursuing for the rest of my life- a degree would probably get me much farther, especially as an international student in a country like US. 

Sometimes I do feel overwhelmed and clueless and think I should switch to less technical roles, and go for MS Business Analytics etc. Life would be more chill, albeit less pay. Other times I seem ambitious and wish to pursue research frontiers and go for MS CS/ML etc. and work at openAI lol.

geph7on,k6icwu,"Personally, DL and RL aren‚Äôt my cup of tea. The model architectures seem completely arbitrary and change every year with the new advancements. To me, they *are* super effective but little more than heuristic techniques. 

If this is the sort of work you want to do, then work experience is the best way progress and taking an educational leave of absence is a poor choice (also, you‚Äôll stop earning/assume debt.)

However, given that you have an MS in physics, you‚Äôre a scientist by training. There are other areas of DS that are more proof, reason, and logic based than DL/RL. If this is the direction you want to go, I think you should explore probabilistic programming. The math would not be hard for you, so you might not even need another graduate degree. Check out the book statistical rethinking to see if this is for you. 

Anyway, a degree in data science, business analytics, etc is just going to give you a broad overview of various model types, it won‚Äôt make you an expert at any one of them. Again, since you already have an MS in physics, I think you could self teach these models and save a bunch of cash.

Bottom line, I don‚Äôt think going back to school will help you much. You just need to zero in on what you want to do and self teach a little. Playing around with APIs is not the hard part, the underlying math is- which you should already be good at.",1

All it takes is 1 applicant with slightly more perceived attractive qualifications than you to get the job, and the applicant pools for DS are huge. I can grind DIY DS for years after work and on weekends, sacrifice a ton of other things in life, and still not get a job because there's that one applicant, always, who either has a PhD, is easy to pay less, is coming from one DS role to another, or just hiring discrimination.  I really am not at all bullish on people trying to make a career change into DS in their 30s+.",21

As far as just applying to jobs, it's never easy, even for those with PhDs. I think there's a lot of luck involved, and sometimes it just comes down to whether an interviewer likes you.

Also I'm not sure how bad it actually is to get a DS job (assuming you're skilled). This sub I imagine isn't the best place to make judgements on this. Most people here are probably those that haven't yet succeeded in finding a job, and make it seem as though the problem is worse than it actually is. It's not easy by any means, but perhaps not the near impossible task some make it out to be. It's just another job at the end of the day.",6

I feel like this is blasphemy in a lot of places, but my understanding of most algorithms is more heavily rooted in understanding when to use them, and the consequences of doing so than an underlying algebra-based understanding.

But it's also worth noting that as a DS, I'm focused on database querying, applied stats/ML modelling, and presentation with BI tools/web front-end.

I try to lean more into my business understanding, communication, and command over Python/Sql/AWS, especially when it comes to higher-level data modelling. This serves my company well as they want models that can be explained to the business, and deep learning solutions are becoming more focused around pre-trained neuralnets.",1

geo23df,k6icwu,"As a broad-strokes overview: 

1. I spent a year and changedoing part-time work teaching Python + JS to kids, \~18/hr
2. I took various part time analyst work one-off jobs for \~1 year, all below 20/hr   
(This is roughly the time when I stopped casually dabbling in a career in data, and started getting serious. I studied \~2 hours a night most nights, and did mooc's/etc for knowledge.)  

3. I was a paid TA for a data analytics bootcamp for 9 months @ 18/hr
4. I leveraged contacts I made at the bootcamp to get into a data engineering consulting position, immediately making $50/hr \~1 year.
5. Using the experiences from the last position, I applied as an Analytics consultant at a managed service provider. This was my first salaried position @ 90k a year. I was in that position for 4 months, then I got laid off due to Covid-19. 
6. I spent the summer upskilling again, building a portfolio of projects and getting certs I felt would up my value. The entire summer was slim pickin's, but after 6 months of the most painful job search of my life, where I had refused to accept a lower salary than my last position, in Q4 fall, hiring opened up again and I was accepted for 4 different jobs, all of which were above 6 figures.",3

What a lot of people don't realize is despite the knowledge and experience, I spend upwards of 30-40 hours a week OUTSIDE of work just learning and staying abreast of the field, especially in ML where things move rather quickly. DS in general is not a field where you can ever put down the book and say ""ok, I'm done. I know DS."" They look at the initial investment of time (learn DS in 6 months!) as a sacrificial period, but one that will eventually end.

Throw a family or other obligations into the mix, and transitioning into DS is hard. Really f\*\*\*ing hard. I've spent the past 5 years prepping for this pandemic (ie social isolation), and it doesn't look like that's going to be changing, the current global pandemic notwithstanding.

People then make the argument that I shouldn't be spending that much time outside of work. But the honest truth of the matter is you will only fall behind other applicants if you don't.

WRT the math you‚Äôre learning there, what is the balance of theoretical versus applied math topics you‚Äôve encountered?

genmzw4,k6icwu,"It *sort of* answers my question. More than that though, it suggests my question was misplaced to begin with, because it was premised on the assumption that you actually took Calc, Lin Alg, etc. as part of the program‚Äôs curriculum, which I guess was incorrect.

That said, your reply is still useful info, and shows that in the theory-application dichotomy, your coursework is definitely more on the application side, which is ultimately was I was interested to know. Thanks!

Edit: BTW, I was asking because I personally have a decent amount of Calc and Lin Alg knowledge already, but it‚Äôs definitely more on the applied side; the deep theory is still pretty above my head, esp. Lin Alg. So I was just wondering whether my current knowledge would already prepare me for a program like yours, versus whether I would immediately drown in theoretical math requirements.",1
geo7jim,k6icwu,"so i'm not entirely sure where the bifurcation of applied and theory occurs. all I know is that my, admittedly, sketchy math background has been acceptable at my graduate program.  i've certainly had to do a lot of googling and I'm 100% certain that folks with better math backgrounds have reaped more from the course material, but I've managed to do well.  

&amp;#x200B;

if I had to make a suggestion: study linear algebra and statistics.  so much of the interpretation I've seen thus far is grounded in statistics and nearly all of the numpy I've employed is based in lin alg.  also, I think statistics is amazing because most of the calculations are relatively simple, but it's the interpretation which is difficult.",2
genz1lk,k6icwu,"It‚Äôs tough to break it down into a definitive ratio. Two of the courses - Introduction to Probability Theory and Fundamentals of Statistics - heavily emphasized what you described as theoretical in your other post, but gave some applications as (abstract) motivators. One course - Data Analysis for Social Scientists - was essentially an econometrics course and focused exclusively on applications. The final course - Machine Learning - teaches applied methods by digging into the theoretical underpinnings, if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

1. [Descriptive Stats - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) \- Can be done in like a week, even though it recommends 11 weeks. However spend some time making sure you really understand each concept (e.g. Central Limit Theorem). I'd advise testing yourself and doing a complete review of what you've learned each week.
2. [Inferential Stats - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201) \- Same as above.
3. [StatsQuest - JoshStarmer YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) \- This is a great resource for stats if you struggle with any concepts. Use it throughout your learning.
4. [Statistics Course - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28) \- Never done this, but it's a cool idea covering this much stuff in a single video.
5. [Stats &amp; Probability - Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability).  - Khan Academy is a really good resource for this kind of stuff. Once you've completed the above, trying blasting yourself through this course and testing yourself. Use other resources or courses for understanding probability if need be.
6. [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) \- Watch this before learning Linear Algebra. Watch it again after.
7. [Linear Algebra Course - Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) \- Plenty of online resources for learning LA, but this is often recommended.
8. [PreCalculus - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw) \- Depends on your knowledge, but you might want to blast through this course over a weekend or two before jumping into calculus.
9. [Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) \- Watch this before learning Calculus. Watch it again after.
10. [Calculus 1 ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1)[Course - Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1) \- This is Calc 1. You'll probably want to work your way up to multivariate. It's debatable how important this is for DS. Probably varies between jobs. I would get Calc 1 done - but don't stress too much about it.

You don't need to do all of the above, and there's possibly some stuff I've missed.

Before/During the above, read both ""The Art of Statistics"" and ""How to Lie with Statistics"". These will give you good, high-level overviews of stats. Also use [All of Statistics](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~wainer/cursos/1s2013/ml/livro.pdf) (a textbook) to supplement your learning. In fact, in might be a good idea to read 1 chapter a week (preferably a chapter related to what you'll be learning that week).  Reading over what you'll be going on to learn is a great way to learn.

Of course, this is all just covering some uni level stats. You'll want to eventually start focusing on machine learning and things like that. For this, use [Intro to Statistical Learning](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf). I don't know if I'd recommend reading page to page.  Just read a chapter on whatever topic you're currently learning, then use it as a reference point.

If the prospect of learning all this is daunting, read ""A mind for numbers"". It'll help you learn how to learn.",5

gely0qw,k6icwu,"Graduated in 2019 with a degree in Business Admin, and have spent all my time since then to self teach myself data science skills. Started out with MOOCs, but none of them ever truly worked because I lacked fundamentals. I hadn‚Äôt taken a calculus course in 5 years, and it was only ‚Äúbusiness calc‚Äù at that. Not to mention I hadn‚Äôt done my one intro to stats class in even longer. 

I finally read ‚ÄúThe Art of Learning‚Äù by Josh Waitzkin about 8 months into my journey and everything finally clicked on why things were so hard, why i wasn‚Äôt learning successfully, why i had hit a wall after learning pandas and was moving on to simple ML concepts. Finally had to get down the basics. Thankfully i have a good situation where I can do gig work part time and dedicate the rest of my life to study but man, I can‚Äôt imagine doing this with a full time job even further removed from school. Even then im planning to take everything I‚Äôve taught myself and apply to OMSA or UT to get a formal masters just because the self study route and the courses provided tend to be messy/extremely misleading with a lot of it is just brilliantly marketed to make one feel like they are prepared when really their hand has been held the entire way.

gekdzqb,k6co45,"In my  experience working in a non-tech large company, most business people do not understand stats beyond the basics. They know what correlation means on the surface, but if you show them to different correlations, few will interpret them correctly. I make it a point to assume they have no stats background when making presentations even if I have heard them use the terms and really explain the terms in simple terms. So far no has complained.",3
gel731s,k6co45,"Working in consulting, something I‚Äôve found is that non-technical stakeholders, management consultants and MBA-types fucking *love* R-squared For many it‚Äôs the only model accuracy metric they‚Äôre familiar with, and they aren‚Äôt comfortable interpreting analytics/modelling work through any other lens. Ultimately that‚Äôs kinda understandable, really ‚Äî obviously non-technical folks won‚Äôt know anything about log-loss or AUC or whatever, so r-squared is likely the only metric they‚Äôve been exposed to.

On a number of occasions I‚Äôve been asked to ‚Äòtranslate‚Äô whatever metric I‚Äôm using into some kind of r^2 like value, even when it‚Äôs wholly inappropriate to do so. I was working on a time series forecasting project recently and I was asked if I could convert the MAPE score into r-squared, because that‚Äôs what the client stakeholders were more familiar with :/",3
gem2sne,k6co45,"I've found there are four types of business people as it relates to analytics in general:

1. Those who have a decent understanding of analytics/stats/etc. Maybe they came from a technical background and pivoted mid-career, maybe they were just naturally drawn to math and so they've been able to always learn from their more technical directs, etc. Whatever it may be, these people are worth their weight in gold, because even if they don't understand a specific concept in detail, you can normally explain it to them in a couple of minutes.
2. Those who are naturally very strong analytically but just haven't had the formal education. These are people that naturally understand things like correlation or causality, but they don't know any of the math behind it. These people are also great to work with, because even when they don't understand exactly what you're describing, they can understand the *spirit* of what you're describing quickly - and they're not going to argue about you on details they don't understand.
3. Those who are naturally bad at math, but know they are. These people are fine to work with - it's tough to communicate with them because they often won't understand what you are saying or the spirit of what you're trying to say, but if they're competent otherwise they will probably be good about deferring/believing you if you've earned their trust.
4. Those who are naturally bad at math, but think that because they're good at \_\_\_\_\_\_, they are also great at math. These people are the bane of my existence. They are the ones that know 3 words in stats, don't actually understand what they mean, but will smugly attack someone else's analysis because *in their made up world* there are flaws in their methodology (though really their issue is because the outcome is not what they wanted). These are people who think that numbers are just something you move around and fudge up until you get the answer you want. These are people who think that there should be 0 responsibility for them to actually learn anything - and that it's someone else's job to be able to always take a concept - no matter how complex - and puree it and serve it to them in a kiddie cup so they can digest it. They will kill projects because they're ""too complex"" even though it's just that it's too complex *for them to understand it*. 

Sometimes these are cultural issues, i.e., some companies tend to promote people without any regards for their data literacy and in fact tend to not promote people whose strength is analytics.

Generally, what tends to happen is that people who are strong analytically aren't as strong elsewhere, so the higher up you go, the less analytical people you see. 

The best companies I've worked at are those who recognize that in this future we're building, understanding numbers and analytics is going to be key. So their leaders - though not in category 1, are at least category 2 people - super sharp people who truly understand numbers.",3
gelst5f,k6co45,"Statistical literacy across our organization has been an ongoing personal battle of mine. I've been told I shouldn't use the word ""distribution"" because it was too much math. I've had several instances where various stakeholders have tried to draw causal conclusions from correlational data and was met with resistance when I tried to point out the error because it didn't match the story we were presenting the client.

It is a gradual education process. The biggest takeaway I've learned from all this is how important it is to understand my audience and be empathetic to their views and background. Some people are excited to hear statistics terms even if they have a surface understanding because to them it feels like they are being let into an exclusive smart person club. Some are intimidated by these terms because they had a horrible experience with math classes in school. However, I've found most people are open to learning if you take the time to explain concepts with concrete opposed to theoretical examples. As always, a little patience with the learning process goes a long way to helping people understand things.",2
gekxcx0,k6co45,"Lol in my experience most of the people on data science teams dont know what significance is, forget the business people.

Strongly recommend you just avoid using any terms that have a precise technical meaning but also a meaning in everyday speech. Either use a more complicated term, so it's clear to people when they dont know what you mean, or just unpack the definition of the terms you use.",3
genwwow,k6co45,"I'm not a data scientist, but I've found when presenting results people generally recognise terms like significance or P Values but don't really know how to think about them or what to do with them. 
  
For example, we were presenting some landing page test results that weren't significant, and everyone know roughly what that meant, but weren't sure what to do - let the test run longer or put the new page into production. 
  
We put the test into Bayesian terms and that made it much more intuitive for everyone to understand. I think that's probably the way to go because Frequentist statistics is a bit weird and hard for people to understand.",1

gek5e7l,k6c7du,Depends on context but for example in this Covid dataset (https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state-data-dictionary) coverage refers to the number of hospitals reporting.,1
gek5w24,k6c7du,That dataset is very similar to the one I am working with but still kind of lost on its meaning. It gives a definition of what inpatient beds used means but under the coverage it says: number of states reporting ‚Äúinpatient beds‚Äù. I don‚Äôt get how it‚Äôs a different metric.,1
gek6rnp,k6c7du,Well in the context above it's how many hospitals in the state reported the metrics used in the other column. Without knowing anything about your dataset I would assume it's something similar.,2
gek7rk6,k6c7du,"Oh, so if I'm understanding this correctly then that would mean the other column is determined by the coverage column. All in all it basically means that there is potential for bias in data due to possibility of not every hospital reporting?",1
geka1zx,k6c7du,"The term data coverage often refers to how complete, or how representative of the whole the dataset is. For example, if I said I have medical claims data for only five states, we would say the data coverage is low, because it only accounts for a low percentage (five states out of 50) of all U.S. medical claims. Or if we had data regarding inpatient stays for 90% of all U.S. hospitals, we would probably say this is high coverage because 90% represents a large majority of the data we‚Äôre interested in.",1

I would interpret that to mean ""We know that Alaska has 1032 inpatient beds. However, the data that we were able to collect corresponds to hospitals that account for 34 inpatient beds only"".",1
gem7wrn,k6c7du,"I looked at one of the other answers above and a link for a dictionary was provided. It makes more sense to me that ""Alaska has 1032 inpatient beds based on the 34 hospitals reporting"". But there could be 50 hospitals in Alaska total so 16 have not reported leading to bias.",1
gekjx97,k6c7du,"I'm a data analyst in a hospital.  I've only ever seen coverage be used in reference to insurance.  However, I don't get into the weeds with inpatient beds very often.

It sounds like you're working with integers.  Could they be a code for insurance category?  Or company?  

For example:

1 = Commercial

2 = Medicaid

3 = Medicare
etc

or

00001 = Apple Health

00002 = Premiera Plan Whatever

00003 = &lt;some state&gt; Medicaid

etc.

I also wonder if it's something like the number of nurses assigned to the beds.  Say there's 10 beds and three nurses, so coverage would be three?  I've seen that sort of measure before, but only in passing.  

If this is really important and you really don't have any clear documentation, trace it back to the source.  Pick up the phone and call the state, county local health juristictions or even the hospitals.  

If they're all filling out the same request, ask to see the request.  Sometimes those are really vague, and some are really well made.  Who the heck knows.",1

gem6mfw,k69dh0,"&gt; However, I am hesitant to accept the offer because my current company (fortune 500 non-technology) has a better name in the field 

In *their* field, or in DS? If they are a bigger name in, say, distribution then that doesn't do antyhing for you as a data scientist.

If they are a bigger name in DS, then that's something to consider - but far from the only thing to consider.

&gt;and much more job stability during the uncertainty of a pandemic. 

This would be a much bigger concern for me. Until we're out of the woods, I would be very hesitant to take another job if that company had any reasonable amount of uncertainty in terms of their future under COVID. 

&gt;The new job would be at another non-tech company that has no reputation for software development or data science. 

So, here's the thing: the reputation of the company is important only in that you may be able to leverage eventually for a better paying job or more opportunities.
