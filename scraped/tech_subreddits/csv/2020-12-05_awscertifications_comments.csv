gepqc1d,k7aptn,"I recommend that everyone study for the Solutions Architect Associate first to give you an overview of the AWS ecosystem. Then probably the Sysops. From what I’ve seen mentioned here,  the certification is going to be a lot more hands on than it use to be. Then go for Devops. 

Unless it’s changed, while the Devops Pro certification was exhausting, it still didn’t go deep enough into what people actually need to know to be good at Devops. 

It doesn’t really go deep into CloudFormation or Docker. 

It doesn’t touch EKS of course it doesn’t go into SAM. 

I’m not trying to discourage you from going for the Devops certification, but if you are really concerned about learning modern Devops, dig into the Docker ecosystem and/or SAM.  I bought a separate 15 hour course when I was learning ClodFormation.",3
gepr2iy,k7aptn,"Thanks for that clarification. I think when I looked at the learning path for the DevOps pro certification, before taking that I had to either take the developer Associate certification OR the SysOps certification, hence why I was wondering where I should be starting. I guess I could do both the SysOps and Solution architect certification since my knowledge is spread across both of these",1
gepmwvk,k7aptn,Subb'd. Also will be doing this in a few months for the WGU program. Been debating on taking the CCP first.,1
gepp5uz,k7aptn,I think the cloud practitioner it’s a pretty basic one. I’ve worked with AWS for more than a year so it makes sense for me to do this since am more of a devops guy.,1
gepp801,k7aptn,"SysOps or Solutions Architect are both fine to start with. Just be aware SysOps is probably the hardest of the three associate exams. Jon Bono’s practice tests are very helpful though. I used Sam Alpati’s all-in-one guide too. For flexibility toss in a little Terraform, Docker, and Python/Boto3 learning on the side. That won’t come into play on the exam but will help you land the job.",1
geppn6z,k7aptn,"Since I’ve worked with python , docker , cloud formation , lambdas , api gateaway , cloudwatch , Code pipeline , S3 , System Manager , parameter store , Automation am guessing the SysOps certification sounds more suitable.  Am not sure what the different is between the solution architect compared to the sysops certification",2
gepqyy7,k7aptn,"SA focuses more on basics like S3/EC2/VPC/RDS. SysOps covers stuff like CodePipeline, Config, OpsWorks, CloudTrail, with a little of the basics mixed in.",2

A new product, service, or feature must be generally available (GA) for 6 months prior to it appearing on a certification exam.

gensaag,k6ympt,"I don't know the course you're talking about nor did I take the CPP, but if you're nervous about your prep, dojo is the gold standard around here for exam practice https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams/ 

If you've never taken a cert exam b4 I'd start by doing the review exams. Then do the timed exams to learn how to properly pace yourself and make use of the mark for review feature, so you don't blow your exam by spending too much time on a question you're unsure about. Then you can return to those questions once you've given every question an answer. Essentially I never spend more than 2 or 3 minutes on a question the first time I see it, but I will answer with my best guess. Then I'll go back to those questions and fix them later. It really helps with the early questions cause I'm usually still feeling the test anxiety.",3
genu0d6,k6ympt,thanks for the tips. this is my first certification exam. if I can pass the timed test in the tutorial above would you say I am ready?,1
genudvb,k6ympt,"Yeah. I'd imagine. I used his stuff for the SAA and Security exam. I scored better on the actual exams than I did his practice exams. That's not to say dojo exams will cover everything asked on the real thing. 

Also, it might just be me, but I think it's normal to feel like you're failing the entire time. I've done really well on my certs and there's only been one exam I didn't feel like I was bombing. That also turned out to be my lowest score.",1
genc2wt,k6v471,I thought the exam doesn't start until the verification is all done so it shouldn't have cost you time?,5
genmswl,k6v471,"It does, but not when the session keeps getting thrown around to different proctors. Every like 20 min a new proctor would message me saying hi, asking if I'm in the middle of a test, and to please show them my desk and monitor cables",2

Are you out the money too? What I will say is that atleast you'll be familiar with the layout of the test and pace yourself better. If you didn't have everything answered with 20 min on the clock, I think you were spending too much time on certain questions and not flagging them.

geml1d4,k6qe96,"It's really challenging to shift gears and move to a brand new industry but hey, you passed the SAA exam which means you got what it takes to succeed, and it's not too late. The only thing missing is your online portfolio, or pro bono projects. You can start off by creating your own website using S3 static web hosting, AWS LightSail or Elastic Beanstalk. I recommend that you start with LightSail as it is cheaper and easier. Try to talk to small businesses or non-profit organizations if you can create their simple website for free. Or just create projects that you are passionate about. 

You can also try offering freelance services like Wordpress development/hosting or Plesk web hosting that can be done using Amazon LightSail or Elastic Beanstalk. Check out some available projects in UpWork or other freelance sites. If you’re already AWS certified, you can opt for the AWS IQ program offered by Amazon (only available to US-based folks). It’s like a freelance consulting for AWS customers. 

You can also earn money online via the Amazon Mechanical Turk marketplace working on Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs)

I hope that helps in building your portfolio!",8

geoelgs,k6qe96,"hey /u/alias_rezistance im not sure which course you used for your study - some include more practical lessons than others. You should have picked up things along the way you can use on your CV. For my students I provide what I call 'advanced demos' [https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) which are pretty complex scenario based practical lessons - I have students who've used these in interviews and they've helped them secure jobs.

In terms of helping you get a role .. you should look at extending to SA Pro .. this will help build your confidence and capability .. which will further help in interviews. At the end of the day really though, its about putting things into action - demos demos demos and just get involved with others in the space

gemmzga,k6p4nf,"First of all, congratulations for getting a PERFECT score on your Developer Associate exam! In my opinion, you have an ample amount of online projects that you can showcase to your soon-to-be employer. Check your local jobsite and look at the other skills needed on the posted DevOps jobs, then acquire those skills. It's just a matter of supply and demand, you supply the skill that companies demand.

You can top it off with a DevOps Pro certification. There are a lot of OpsWorks in the DevOps exam and some Beanstalk questions. It is quite heavy on CI/CD, configuration and deployment management. Make sure that you know the advanced concepts such as Custom Actions in CodePipeline, Custom Layer/Cookbook in OpsWorks and Custom Resource in CloudFormation, plus various CodeDeploy types (Immutable, Blue/Green, Rolling etc)

I have 2 years of xp in it and I was planning on taking it before the year end.",2
genmm05,k6o9l3,"IMO, CCP is what AWS calls as fundamental cert. The course from which you prepare matters a lot as well. Stephane's courses are generally good as I've personally taken his Solutions architect. 2 years experience in IT is more than enough to crack this bad boy. Because this is entry level test so it isn't bad in terms of what they ask in the test. CCP is mostly memory based test as they do not have lengthy questions as what they have in Solutions Architect where hands on experience is a must. You still have time to take it before the year end.

gekjy7q,k6efbo,"You are right in that the cloud doesn't provide very many entry level positions. Most people will repeat the same answer because it's true, you need to start at help desk. Once you work help desk for 1-2 years you become a system admin and begin to touch the cloud on a basic level such as maintaining the cloud side of AD (Azure AD), Office 365, Windows and Linux environments, etc. Then while working as a system admin start knocking out your certifications in AWS and actually applying what you learn to practical application. For example I pitched to my boss to host an internal corporate directory website in AWS that included some basic lambda functions to pull DynamoDB data and allowed CRUD. 

You now have:
1) help desk experience / admin experience (nobody will hire a brand new employee)
2) Probably your solutions architect and maybe either developer or sys ops. Get 2 associate level certs or so.
3) Actual real world experience you can put on your resume that you did work in the cloud.

gem6x0n,k6831x,"Start with AWS Cloud Solutions Architect as it’s decent cert and will give a nice overview of core AWS services 👍

Let me know if you have any questions 

Also I would skip the Cloud a practitioner as it’s for non technical people, more like a sales one",1
gemo07e,k6831x,"You can start off with the Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) exam or go straight to SAA. It's your choice and it depends on your level of experience in AWS.

The CLF-C01 exam is the entry-level cert and it has various questions that revolves in billing, cost management, support plans, cloud concepts, basic AWS services and many others. Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, RI Utilization tracking, Standard vs. Reserved Instance, Upfront, Partial &amp; No Upfront payment types and many others.

I also recommend that you take the free 6-hour  AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials digital course: https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/

gen76nm,k6831x,"If you’re new to the cloud I’d highly recommend starting with Cloud Practitioner, I just passed a few weeks ago. It’ll give you foundational knowledge to use for the practice parts of the Solutions Architect when you go to learn how to use the services.",1

geintzy,k63kcx,Congratulations bro. Deleting prod databases would be my worst nightmare.,16
geiuuvp,k63kcx,I've done it! I still have nightmares about it.,3
geiw88k,k63kcx,"yeah, that dreaded feeling and the look of your boss' face that prod was messed up! Thank heavens for automated backups!",3
geiwxgn,k63kcx,That was another problem... new company.. their only backup was an export and they had never done any DR testing. Scary!!!,2
geixe93,k63kcx,"yeah, i really don't know the deal with these guys. companies, both old and new ones (including startups), should always have some sort of disaster recovery or business continuity plan for their data. This is also the idea on my head why I took the exam, it gives me that edge to flex my DB skills along with my other cloud skills at work, since all large companies have some sort of databases.",2
geioil8,k63kcx,"Thanks! Yeah, prod issues are stressful man, not to mention the on-call I get on the wee hours of the day for support. Use Aurora Global Database with RPO of less than 5 seconds and RTO is less than 1 minute, or use RDS Read Replica to reduce lost data! These are the things that sinked in to me and share to my team.",5
geikplg,k63kcx,"So yeah, after 2 weeks of study, I passed the Database Specialty exam! Compared to Security Specialty, this one has almost the same difficulty, scenario length and focus. The scenarios are like, *""A Database Specialist is this... or that...""* with a particular focus on various features of AWS Database Services (RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, DocumentDB, Neptune, Redshift...), it's like Security Specialty in a sense that the theme of the exam is all about Databases, unlike SAA that covers a much wider topic range. There is also a lot of AWS DMS questions, failover and disaster recovery scenarios. Advanced DB concepts like Aurora fault injection queries and promotion tier showed up. Messing around with the AWS Console and doing those practice tests really helped fast track my review.

We're heavily using AWS at work and achieving this certification really helped me have an in-depth understanding on RDS/Aurora that we use on our prod environments, like there's this new Storage Auto Scaling in RDS and high RTO/RPO for Aurora Global databases. Exam prep materials I used are:

Tutorials Dojo: [https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-database-specialty-practice-exams/](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-database-specialty-practice-exams/)

I also read the FAQs for each database services. My next target would be Data Analytics Specialty, either I take it before this year ends to keep my momentum or next month. Already have Stephane Maarek and Frank Kane's Udemy course and Tutorials Dojo practice tests for my prep.",12
gejy2l0,k63kcx,Almost wish I didn't read this. Gives me another cert to consider. Congrats btw.,2
gek6ar0,k63kcx,"yeah, you won't regret it. lots of learnings for this DB cert and it's a quick win.",1
geiqn1c,k63kcx,We've all been there.,3
geivj5v,k63kcx,"yeah, but we shouldn't be. there's this guy at work who used the master DB user as the credential for our application. that's a big no-no since the app can affect the entire database including the other applications that uses the DB. This is why I love cloud computing so much, makes database backups easier to do and easier to recover than before",1
geiuew6,k63kcx,"Congratulations🎉 and thank you for using our Database Specialty practice tests! 

All the best in your upcoming Data Analytics exam! Don't rush it bro! It has lots of questions about Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, QuickSight, Redshift, Elastic MapReduce (EMR), Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) and Kinesis (Data Analytics, Data Firehose, Data Analytics). It’s important that you know how these services interact with each other to develop a complete data analytics solution in AWS. Prepare to see a lot of Apache technologies as well, such as Apache Parquet, ORC, Avro, Oozie, Sqooq, HBase and many others.

I have to say that your explanations are top-notch, from the custom diagrams, rationales for each options and relevant AWS Docs links.

geimoni,k62e73,"this is with YouTuber NetworkChuck and Anthony Sequeira right? I have it, lots of demos but the topics covered are not highly relevant for the SAA-C02. Stick with Stephane Maarek or Adrian Cantrill in my opinion. The course is also fairly short at less than 8 hours, considering that the course has 3 instructors",1
gei7k8d,k61g4f,"There aren't prerequisites. I started with two specialty exams (Machine Learning and Big Data, which was the predecessor to the current DA exam), then looped back to the associate level ones, and now am halfway through the Pro ones.

That said, be aware that it's pretty brutal to jump to that level.

CCP from what I've seen is essentially floors 1-2 in difficulty. The associate exams are probably floors 2-7. The Pro exams and Specialty exams are like floor 25.

I'd recommend taking a look at some of the sample questions ([https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-data-analytics-specialty/AWS-Certified-Data-Analytics-Specialty\_Sample-Questions.pdf](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-data-analytics-specialty/AWS-Certified-Data-Analytics-Specialty_Sample-Questions.pdf)) to get an idea of what you'll be in for. You'll be in for 3 hours of such questions (65 questions).

That said, there's not too much overlap between the associate/pro exams and the specialty ones that I've seen. The associate/pro ones only very, very lightly touch the content in the specialty exams, while the specialty ones of course go very very deeply into those services/subjects. But it may be useful to at least do an associate one as a way of starting to slightly ramp up your experience taking the exams. Additionally, you are probably going to be pretty hobbled if you only know about the data analytics tools, but don't have a bit wider AWS knowledge. I'd probably recommend that you do the SAA cert before you consider a specialty cert.",2
geiawit,k61g4f,"thanks for the detailed breakdown! it looks pretty intimidating, not going to lie. I guess I'm going to get the SAA first so I'm more familiar with the AWS field and then move on to the DA specialty",3
geierq0,k61g4f,"I passed the Data Analytics exam and I strongly suggest that you pass your SAA first before moving to the Specialty certs to gain a more extensive knowledge in core AWS services.

For the AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty (DAS-C01) exam, it has 65 questions that you must finish within 3 hours. The scenario-based questions here are lengthy; comparable to what you’ll see on your Solutions Architect and DevOps Engineer Professional-level exams! The scenarios are long but the options are not, unlike in the Pro-level ones.

Lots of questions about Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, QuickSight, Redshift, Elastic MapReduce (EMR), Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) and Kinesis (Data Analytics, Data Firehose, Data Analytics). It’s important that you know how these services interact with each other to develop a complete data analytics solution in AWS. Prepare to see a lot of Apache technologies as well, such as Apache Parquet, ORC, Avro, Oozie, Sqooq, HBase and many others.

For my exam prep, I heavily used the official Exam Readiness video course (that is available for free from the AWS Learning Library):  https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=46612 

The new Exam Readiness course is now more interactive with responsive image maps, accordions, sample problem sets, section-based quizzes and a practice test in the end (around 17 questions only).

geifw4n,k5wo76,"Go on Google and find the best reviewed course to study for the exam then you can either pay for the course or you can go on a torrent site and bootleg it for free if you can't afford it (whichever option you take morally is up to you). 

I would personally recommend A Cloud Guru but YouTube has a ton of free courses too -- I would say just pick a course with good reviews with a teacher you can easily listen to. I don't know why but I can't listen to anyone that isn't a native English speaker since they either talk too fast or they constantly mispronounce words without care. I need for studying reasons for everything to be as easy as possible. 

To make the process easier search on Google study methods and stick to one that you like. Do not follow anyone's study routine that you personally are not comfortable with. 

After studying for however long it takes for you to understand the subject material then begin to take practice exams for an entire month prior to sitting your test. Once you score 80-90% book your test immediately because you're more than ready to pass the exam. Some recommend paid practice exams like what Jon Boso sells or using Amazon's official AWS practice test but I think [https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/) is the best one since not only is it free but you have access to it forever. 

I would supplement your learning with white papers and reading the FAQ as well as another course just so that you have another outlook on the topics you're learning. I personally didn't use a second course but instead just used any articles and videos I could find in Google and YouTube as well as messaging people on LinkedIn that you are connected to that work as AWS Cloud Engineers for help. 

Oh, and do as many labs as possible and document it for LinkedIn so employers can see that you have some form of work experience. Then that leads into working on your CV so that what you are teaching yourself is reflected.

Sounds like a lot but 4+ hours a day of self-studying (at least 20 hours a week) and you'll be ready in no less than 4-6 weeks max. I then did a week of intense practice tests for much longer than 4 hours a day for over a week and I passed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck.👻",1
geigcix,k5wo76,"Also, don't do that silly thing where people book their exam ahead of fully understanding the subject material. Only book your exam when you have confidently passed the practice exam by 80-90%. If you book the exam prior to gaining the knowledge then you'll just put even more unnecessary pressure on yourself -- don't be that guy/gal. 

The official AWS practice test is not challenging enough in my opinion but still good to do since it's the closest to taking the REAL exam. Watch Youtube videos of people taking the test so nothing will throw you by the time you take your exam. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards, 2Pac.👻",3
gei2cgp,k5wo76,I'm in the same boat and taking an udemy course by Neal Davis. Finished 4 chapters so far and it's pretty concise and clear but I have nothing to compare it to. Hopefully it's good enough for me to pass the exam after,0
