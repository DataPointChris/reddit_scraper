You say your file transfers are slow. How are they slower on Linux vs your windows experience. Are you moving between partitions? Between disk drives on the local computer?

gept41t,k77gdq,"Checklist:

* Put your VM disk in an SSD. IO is pretty much always a bottleneck, and even the cheapest SSD will outperform any HDD in random IO
* Make sure you use the same CPU layout, some hypervisors do this automatically, others like KVM have checkbox explicitly use the same vCPU as your real CPU.
* It's worth noting that Virtualbox's Video Memory uses the hosts's RAM, not VRAM, therefore there's still a memcpy() needed to diplay the video. So I'd say you'd be better of just using the default \~24MB, unless you are using like 8K virtual displays.
* Make sure you are giving the VM only real cores, not hyperthreading or SMT cores, as those pretty much have no effect on the VM, and will probably actually harm your performance. For example, in an i7-7820HK processor, it has an 4C/8T configuration, so the VM should have, at most, 4C.
* Use the VirtIO drivers, you'll probably need to reinstall the OS to fully enjoy these, but either way, if the VM cooperates with the hypervisor, certain expensive operations, like emulating SATA, etc, might be skiped, which can improve latency, CPU usage, etc.
* Use a debloater script to remove the crapware Windows 10 has.",1.0

geopf8e,k740t9,"GNU is an operating system that implements POSIX (mostly).

GNU can be built with different kernels. HURD is one, but there was also Debian GNU/kFreeBSD for some time. You can also run GNU on Windows with WSL (though WSL 2 runs GNU on Linux in a VM).

Similarly, Linux can be used with different user-land software. Many Linux operating systems are not POSIX. For example, Android is a popular Linux operating system. There are also POSIX operating systems that use Linux and a user-lands other than GNU, such as Alpine.

Because this two things can be used together, but can also be used with different components, it's useful to refer to that combination specifically in many contexts. Fedora, Debian, arch, and gentoo are all GNU/Linux operating systems. Alpine, Android, and dd-wrt are all Linux operating systems.
