k78tgc,Error trying to run inference on a saved model,"Hi,

I made a post a couple of days ago when I was struggling with the same project and I got great help, so I figured I'd give it another shot. I'm kind of a noob at coding/tensorflow and I need to get a webcam object detector running with a custom model for school. Before going for the webcam I figured I'd try simple classification first. Turns out, it's not that simple. Not for me at least. I managed to train a custom network and now I'm trying to run inference. I found a notebook on how to run inference on a pre-trained model (link: [https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object\_detection/colab\_tutorials/object\_detection\_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/colab_tutorials/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb))

I tried to modify that code to run with my own saved model and came up with this: [https://github.com/007Nick700/object-detection/blob/main/object%20detection%20tutorial%20test.ipynb](https://github.com/007Nick700/object-detection/blob/main/object%20detection%20tutorial%20test.ipynb)

In the last code block I'm getting a bunch of errors that I can't seem to find a fix to. It states:

"" Failed to get convolution algorithm. This is probably because cuDNN failed to initialize, so try looking to see if a warning log message was printed above. ""

First thing that comes to mind is that cuDNN isn't compatible with CUDA, but it is. I'm running Cuda 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6 and I managed to train my model with it.

Would anyone happen to have an idea as to what is wrong here? The original notebook with the pre-trained model worked fine untill I changed it. 

The only things I've changed are the ""Loader"" code block, the paths to the label map/test images and the name of the model(model\_name) under ""Detection""

Thanks in advance!",3,tensorflow,2020-12-05
k6ygtb,ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable: ['Variable: 0']," 

hi i'm wanting one image to turn into another with every training step.

First

* load 2 images (source, target)
* we calculate the error between each image
* We optimize the output image so that it looks more and more like the target image.

but when trying to run it gives me this error

ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable: \['Variable: 0'\].

k6pv83,Any ideas for how to put together my ML project idea? I want to do something in Tensorflow that can scan photos to recognize missing information on forms," Hi folks, I am pretty new to ML but I've been teaching myself Python and Tensorflow via Coursera/some books and I really enjoy computer vision.

I need help figuring out the architecture of this idea I have...anyone willing to spare some thoughts please? I work at a bureaucratic organization and one of my functions is to check paperwork for missing fields or errors. The applications I check are usually 3-4 pages but I want to try for the first 2 pages only.

My idea: create a model that could have a photo uploaded to recognize which info is missing (blank spaces) or incorrect (for example, a signature that's too big which needs to be in a certain bounded box, incomprehensible writing, etc)

I'd then like to add on a graphical part to the model which would box in red what info is missing or needs attention..

I don't know how I would do this though - I figure a CNN would be involved but I'm struggling to figure out how to structure this

If you were me, what would you do? I thought I'd start by putting together dozens of fake applications myself with varying levels of info (some filled out entirely, some half filled out, some missing just 2 boxes of info) and using those images to train.

Any pointers, please??

I am soooo lost tbh. I am a newbie so any guidance would be super appreciated

(I'm basically trying to figure out how to automate myself out of a job - while I can scan these applications,, I miss things here and there, and my job would be easier if I could have the vital info to review somehow highlighted first rather than reading the entire thing). I only know a bit of Python so I'd be looking to do it in this language.

Thank you!!!!!!",1,tensorflow,2020-12-05

k64oug,How to convert a Tensorflow Dataset into an iterable form when using a distributed strategy?,"I'm trying to use Tensorflow's distributed strategies to train a stock trading model. The data is intraday data, and I'm breaking it up so that each training step is an entire day's worth of data (with many individual sub-steps happening within that day). The model I'm creating is actually two models that will work and be trained together. I need to pass the features for both of those models, as well as data used to calculate what the reward should be (as I'm using RL). Before training, I loop through all the days that need to be trained on and call a function that returns these three elements. I then convert this data to a tensor using `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.ragged.constant(combined_features))`, with `combined_features` being the combined data for all days that are being trained on.

What I'm confused about is how to separate that data in the training function into the three lists of data. I also need to be able to iterate over the datasets since I need to walk through each step for that day and complete training on it. I saw there's a `Dataset.as_numpy_iterator()` function, but it says that it can only be used in eager mode. Due to performance reasons when using distributed strategies, eager mode isn't an option for me.

k5mmzs,Stitching together complex network with several inputs with keras.,"So, my task is to give a rating to another's algo image segmentation job using ground truth segmentation map and rating from the human expert. As i've failed to obtain any similarity metric what would correlate with the rating well enough, it's time for neural networks. Of course i could just train an autoencoder from which i will then obtain a latent representation of an image and see if those features give me better results (in fact i know they will from another person's solution to the same problem), but i also want to try a bit of a different approach. I want a network which would consist of two CNN's, for expert mask and for evaluated algo mask, which would at the fully connected part be concatenated and then use that combined vector to predict ratings. So it's sort of like a letter Y if that makes sence. The idea here to make both CNN backpropagate jointly and actually make use of rating ground truth when training CNNs, thus hopefully achieving better result. So, i know it's a valid network architecture, but how do i actually code something like this in keras? I could just write it in raw tf, but i don't want to go insane just yet. I guess the part i have the question with is how to make the model object process several inputs which would start in different branches, rest of it is fairly straightforward and i can probably figure it out on my own.",1,tensorflow,2020-12-05

k55kuk,Status: device kernel image is invalid even though PTX kernel is available for lower compute capability,"Getting the above error on a custom build of TF 2.3 on Ubuntu 20.04 (built in NVidia Docker against CUDA 10.1). I had to build it myself because official TF binary releases dropped support for many common compute capabilities.

So I figured I would chose the default suggestion for compute capabilities in the build script, namely 3.5 and 7.0, assuming the 3.5 kernels would be compatible to all newer GPUs.

Now, it works fine on a 2070 which has CC 7.5. However it does not work on a 1080 (CC 6.1)  and I get ""device kernel image is invalid"". But the build contains both PTX and ELF kernels for sm\_35 and sm\_70, I have verified this with cuobjdump. I would assume the sm\_35 PTX kernels should be compilable to binary code for the 1080 by the driver, right?

If I do CUDA\_FORCE\_PTX\_JIT=1 it ALSO stops working on my 2070 - even though it has PTX and ELF kernels for sm\_70 as mentioned above.

  
Also, it takes a long time (maybe 30s) after calling tf.compat.v1.Session() for the error to show up so apparently it is an issue with PTX JIT compilation. I have tried deleting the cache (.nv) and raising the cache size, same thing happens.

My issue is how to convert the model I was giving to have the needed inputs/outputs? I found this ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55373048/tensorflow-how-can-i-add-an-image-decoder-node-to-my-graph](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55373048/tensorflow-how-can-i-add-an-image-decoder-node-to-my-graph)) and I think it can be used for the input but I'm not sure about the output. I'm assuming it's using the Object Detection API so somehow I need to convert the Keras model into an Object Detection API model?",2,tensorflow,2020-12-05

k4mucl,Trying to run an image classifier on a custom model,"Hello everyone,

First of all I'm pretty new to python and TF so my apologies If I'm asking really dumb questions.So far I've trained a network by follow the guide found in this video:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvyDYdI2nEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvyDYdI2nEI)

After exporting the inference graph I wanted to test the model using this colab notebook:[https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object\_detection/colab\_tutorials/object\_detection\_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/colab_tutorials/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb)

I don't fully understand it however. I downloaded the TF object detection API from github and I have it saved locally on C:\\tensorflow2\\models. Whenever I run the code block below it still starts cloning, yet I already have it? Perhaps I need to set a path to it? I just don't know how.

Further down by ""Loading Label map"" I'm greeted with the same problem. I try to set the path to my label map and test images but they are not found:

My last question is how I would have to set the object detection model to my trained model. It is a .pb file so I believe that is correct?

EDIT: I managed to get the directories recognized by running it locally instead of in Colab. However I'm still not quite sure how to load my own model in there, as the code is made for pretrained models. I've been trying to find an example but I haven't found anything I can use yet.

As far as I can tell I don't need this code block at all, as I'm not trying to download a pretrained model but instead use a custom one?

I found another IPYNB here that uses custom models:   
[https://github.com/TannerGilbert/Tutorials/blob/master/Tensorflow%20Object%20Detection/object\_detection\_with\_own\_model.ipynb](https://github.com/TannerGilbert/Tutorials/blob/master/Tensorflow%20Object%20Detection/object_detection_with_own_model.ipynb)

However it's for TF1 and I'm using TF2. I've tried migrating the code to TF2 but I always run into some sort of error.

Thanks in advance, and again sorry if I am asking really dumb stuff.",2,tensorflow,2020-12-05
