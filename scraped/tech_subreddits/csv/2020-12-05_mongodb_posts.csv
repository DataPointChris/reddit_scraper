k6kqb6,Need help getting MongoDB working on CentOS 7: 'Job for mongod.service failed because a timeout was exceeded.',"Hey, I'm not sure if this sub is really meant for support requests but I'd really appreciate if someone could help me with this. I'm not really a mongo user, I just have an application I need to install on a server and it uses mongo. The whole stack for this application has been a pain and I'm at the last hurdle with mongo now, but it won't run.

So I get this error:

    # sudo systemctl start mongod
    Job for mongod.service failed because a timeout was exceeded. See ""systemctl status mongod.service"" and ""journalctl -xe"" for details.

&amp;#x200B;

Systemctl status gives me this:

k6ddf0,New to scalable database design and need some advice.,"I'm building a social media type website using MongoDB w Mongoose and I'm wondering if my design is going to run into trouble at some point.

I have the following collections:
 
USER 

COMMENT 

MESSAGE

Is this poor design? Should there be no seperate COMMENT AND MESSAGE collection that exists on outside of USER? As in, should this only exist in USER?

This is my first post in the subreddit, and I hope it's alright that I'm asking about Mongoose (it's safe to say the community probably has strong opinions about it, but I've joined a project, where I have no options but to use it). Anyway...

I'm wondering if there's a way to build a mongoose query that includes multiple $or queries (like either a or b is true, but also either c or d is true). I've tried nesting the multiple $or operators in a single $and operator, but have had no luck getting that to work. I'm not that familiar with advanced Mongoose concepts, but would a clever query builder process or the aggregate pipeline be able to help with this?",0,mongodb,2020-12-05

k4lyq2,Running Mongo DB workloads on K8s using the community operator,"I have searched the web quite some time about the concept of running mongodb and dbs in general on Kubernetes. Opinions seem to be quite dividing between different people. 

I  found the MongoDB [community operator for k8s](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator) which i played around quite a bit and managed to deploy a mongo db in cluster mode on 3 k8s nodes on aws ec2 instances using KOPS.

My issue is that i have created a large automated process that creates and deletes the whole k8s cluster. My main concern is that databases are state full workloads and should be really careful not to lose any data. I am looking for ideas on how to safeguards accidental deletion of the EBS volumes used by Mongo in an unfortunate event. 

I am also looking at ways to backup the mongo data on the kubernetes cluster but was unable to find a tutorial describing exactly that for mongo dbs deployed using the community operator. Most of the references that come up refer to the enterprise operator and Mongo Atlas. 

I would appreciate your help if you have a similar stack with the community k8s operator and how do you manage the day to day DBA tasks.",1,mongodb,2020-12-05
k4impo,oplog length varies - why?,"I have a replica set with oplog set to 100000MB. I wonder why the oplog length in time varies so much. Sometimes it says it has oplog for ~40 hours but right now it says the oplog length is 8.7 hours.

Why is that?

The point is that I don't want some lengthy index creation processes run out of oplength because it would render a read replica useless and it has to be synced from beginning and the newly created index got lost.

I wish there were a setting where I could set oplog length in time units, not in size units (megabytes). Storage is cheap, time is expensive :)",0,mongodb,2020-12-05

Hello, for a school project I have to use Mongodb. I'm creating a website that serves info about movies. Currently I have everything working properly (runs on RAM using json files) now I have to add in mongoDB and deploy the final product to OpenStack. From my understanding when u normally use MongoDB locally it saves all your data on your local machine. So when uploading to OpenStack i would have to write some kind of script to upload the data as well and set up the database again on openstack. Then I came across MongoDB Atlas, considering it uses AWS does this mean it saves the all my data online? that way I wouldn't have to upload all my data to openstack because Mongo will be getting the data from the cloud?

k3psw4,need help designing a subscription-unsubscription stuff,"I have a database design, such that there are two users. A creator, and a customer.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am using no-sql db design, such that if a customer subscribed to a creator, this is stored in both of their individual arrays of subscriotion\_details. So a creator can have multiple customers in his/her subscriptions, and for a customer's subscriptions array , it contains the list of all his/her subscriptions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now when in dispute there is an option to block both the creator and the customer for short term at least. 

So if you block a creator, i'll as of now empty the subscriptions array for a creator and for the customers, need to loop through all the subscribed customers to this creator and remove his/her id from the subscriptions array of theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the opposite happens when we block a customer. Need to loop through all the trainers he/she have subscribed and need to remove this customer's id from the subscription array of those creators.

k2o71u,Filtering by an index field and then sorting by _id results in colscan,"I have a price collection with product ids in it, I have indexed the productid so that getting prices from productid is fast. Had a need to do some aggregation, so added a match phase with productid and then added in sort phase with \_id so that I can sort the results in descending order, thought documents will be first filtered based on match phase and then sorted based on \_id. But when I run explain, I can see that keypattern used is 

    {""_id"" : 1}

and the index on productid is not used. From keysExamined, I can see that the entire collection is scanned as keysExamined equals the size of collection. If I remove the sort phase, everything runs as expected, index on productid is used and keysExamined is much lesser like how its supposed to be. Am I missing something here with sort based on \_id?

Please note that above is just an example I created in local setup where this issue can be seen.",1,mongodb,2020-12-05
k2aavy,Finding Values in Nested document,"New to Mongodb. I want to be able to get a value based on the path of the data. Like a dictionary in Python.
I have many docs with this structure:

    Station
        type
            day : value i want

Basically i want it to give me the value at station.type4.day13

Is there an easy/efficient way to do this?
Maybe mongo isn't the tool for me or I should restructure it. I'm open to suggestions. 

Thanks!


edit: added document in mongo syntax
