gens9wt,k6xv6x,"`data-` attributes dont mean, or do anything by themselves. you can add any number of data- attributes, and they could hold any kind of data. they are there for a script to use.

`&lt;tr data-sort=""asc"" data-type=""fish, frog, airplane"" data-selected=""true"" data-snowType=""crunchy""&gt;`

is fine, but without a script acting on it, none of them matter.

whatever script you are using will determine how and what data- attributes are, and what they do. 

so yes, `&lt;tr data-type=""fish, dog""&gt; ` is ok, but if the current script expects only one variable in the data, its not going to do much. its probably looking for `fish, dog` rather than `fish` and/or `dog`.",5
genxrk5,k6xv6x,"I currently have a dropdown menu that filters out values based on the choice that is clicked but I would like to create a separate dropdown with different values that will also filter out values that are clicked. 

The HTML for the dropdown looks like this: 

&lt;select class=""filter-fish""&gt;

  &lt;option value=""""&gt;Filter by category&lt;/option&gt;

  &lt;option value=""angelfish""&gt;Angelfish&lt;/option&gt;

  &lt;option value=""anthias""&gt;Anthias&lt;/option&gt;

  &lt;option value=""blenny""&gt;Blenny&lt;/option&gt;

&lt;/select&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

The &lt;tr&gt; looks like this: &lt;tr data-type=""anthias""&gt;

and the script looks like this: 

&lt;script&gt;

$('.filter-fish').on('change', function(e) {

  // retrieve the dropdown selected value

  var location = e.target.value;

  var table = $('.filter-table-data');

  if (location.length) {

table.find('tr\[data-type!=' + location + '\]').hide();

table.find('tr\[data-type=' + location + '\]').show();

  } else {

table.find('tr').show();

  }

});

&lt;/script&gt;

Would it be logical to create a separate script for the second dropdown menu or is there a way to integrate a second dropdown menu into this script?

gejox5m,k651nm,"To me, it seems what you're looking for is responsive web design. This is a concept which means a website will respond to the device/screen size. The key aspects of it are responsive units and media queries.

**Responsive Units** \- Some HTML/CSS units are relative to screen size and other traits. At this point, you are probably using `px` for width, height, etc. It's a good idea to instead use units like `%` (% of the container), `vw` (% of the viewport/screen width), `vh` (% of the viewport/screen height), and more. Deciding which unit to use for each situation requires some judgement, but fiddling with it for a while should yield positive results! [More on units](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css_units.asp)

**Media Queries** \- A media query is a statement using `@media` that you make in your CSS file. You can then define which traits you want to look out for such as screen width and height. Using media queries allows you to specify different CSS values for different media types. I won't go into too much detail here, but you can learn about media queries at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)!

Hope this helps, and good luck!",1

What that means is you want the image in the same place as your HTML file. Wherever that file is, is your document root if you're just testing locally without a server involved.

If you're working from a folder on your desktop, put the image next to the file, and you can call it with `&lt;img src=""filename.ext"" /&gt;`. Remember, on most servers, it's case sensitive, so `Filename.ext` `filename.ext` and `filename.Ext` are 3 separate, distinct files.",5

Pathing will be the same of all instances but with pathing you learn the difference between absolute and relative pathing. For example, you have an HTML page stored in root folder MyPage. In your root folder MyPage you have a folder called Images. In this folder you have stored all your images including example.jpg. 

Let's say your html page is in the folder MyPage, thus it is the root folder. Therefore the img src attribute will have for its value ""Images/example.jpg"". 

Let's say you do not have an images folder and decided to store example.jpg in your root folder MyPage. Your index.html is also in root folder MyPage. Therefore your img src attribute value will now just hold the string ""example.jpg"" as the image is contained in the same folder as your html file.

There are some limitations due to their practice of putting free servers “to sleep”, but as long as you understand how and when they do that it shouldn’t really be a problem for small projects, and you can always pay later.

Heroku runs server side code so you’ll need to know node.js (which is what I use), or a similar language. This enables you to make dynamic websites so it’s well worth the effort.

Good luck!",1

gebtuf1,k4zpju,Doesn’t the whole path to the file work too?,1

gebuepf,k4zpju,https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp good examples on how to use paths here. Not sure if that is the whole path because don’t know the file system on your computer.,2
gecnkas,k4zpju,"Just to clarify and help you understand, an absolute path works, but keep in mind that it's the browser that reads it and the browser doesn't have access to the entire machine, only what the server ""serves"". And that is probably starting at the folder `html` (could be different though).

So an absolute path for the browser, would be `/portfolio/portfolio-pictures/Montage.png` (supposing the server serves the folder html).

Just wanted to help you with this but **you really should use relative paths whenever possible**.",2
